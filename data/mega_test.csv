8,"Britain's Ladbroke Group Plc Monday concluded a long-awaited global alliance with Hilton Hotels Corp., reuniting the Hilton brand worldwide for the first time in 32 years.
Despite the tie-up, which covers 400 hotels in 49 countries, the two companies denied there was a hidden agenda to progress toward a full merger of the two groups.
""We're taking a first step in bringing the hotels business much closer. We're putting the relationship back together and who knows what may come of it,"" said Ladbroke Chief Executive Peter George.
The companies said the deal covering sales and marketing, frequent customer programmes and development would fuel top-line growth and dispel the confusion that has surrounded the two groups in recent years.
Hilton has operated separately within and outside the U.S. market since 1964, when Hilton International was spun off from HHC.
""From our customers' point of view this will look as if it's one company for the first time in 32 years. For many years we've confused our guests ... They'll now no longer see a difference between a London Hilton and a Hilton in New York,"" said Stephen Bollenbach, chief executive of HHC.
""These two companies will have such a close alliance and so many points of contact with each other that I believe you will get all the benefits of one legal entity whether or not you become one legal entity.""
The reunification would also help both groups capitalise on industry growth and make them more resilient in cyclical downturns, George said.
Announcing the signing of the agreements for the hotel deal, which was first unveiled last summmer, the companies also said a worldwide loyalty programme -- Hilton HHonors Worldwide -- would start Feb. 1.
That would be the single most important marketing link between the two, George said, adding that there was scope for further cooperation in other areas such as gaming.
""There is a gaming provision as well whereby we're looking at doing some gaming projects together,"" said George.
""It's not a deal that involves a great deal of cost savings but the primary benefit is the top line -- it'll be driving revenues. It can be valued in the tens of millions of dollars to each company.""
As expected, the agreements provide for taking cross shareholdings of up to 20 percent. Hilton said it intended to acquire a 5 percent stake in Ladbroke in due course.
Mutual participation in future hotel development will focus primarily on management contracts and franchises, but the companies said it was no longer proposed that each make minority investments in the other's hotel real estate.

10,"Scottish Amicable on Thursday asked for firm offers for the company to be tabled by the end of February as it emerged that more potential bidders had joined the auction for the mutually-owned insurance group.
Three companies were already known to have signed confidentiality agreements which give access to ScotAm's books - Abbey National, Prudential Corp and Australian Mutual Provident (AMP).
But a source close to the deal said that others had also signed the agreements and that potential bidders were now ""certainly more than three.""
ScotAm said that all interested parties would be requested to table firm offers by February 28.
A spokesman for ScotAm declined to comment on either the number or the identity of companies who had signed the confidentiality agreements.
One possibility is Dutch insurance group Aegon whose acquistion of Scottish Equitable has already demonstrated its ability to provide extra capital to develop the business according to industry experts.
Another firm rumoured to have contemplated a bid, Belgian-Dutch insurer Fortis is reported to have ruled a bid out and Lloyds TSB said earlier this week it was not interested in bidding.
Lloyds chief executive Peter Ellwood said that the company had run a slide-rule over ScotAm but that the bid premium looked too high.
Meanwhile, The Scotsman newspaper on Thursday reported that AMP is considering moving its Bristol-based subsidiary London Life to Scotland if its Scottish Amicable bid is successful.
The paper said that AMP would use Scotland to expand into Europe, and that it placed considerable importance on the Glasgow office of Scottish Amicable Investment Managers (SAIM).
The Prudential and Abbey National are believed to have plans to downscale or close SAIM, the paper said.
Following the receipt of bids, ScotAm will hold further discussions after which bidders will be required to submit final, binding proposals.
At the end of the process, the board will recommend a single proposal and an announcement of the recommended acquiror is expected to be made by the end of March.
Under the terms of the confidentiality agreements the decision of the board is final.
""We believe the process we are publishing today will maximise value for policyholders and will be seen to have done so,"" ScotAm's chairman Sandy Stewart said.
In a move which may help deflect criticism of the sealed bid process, ScotAm said it would make firm offers public, if required to do so by a bidder.
In addition, the Department of Trade &amp; Industry and an independent actuary will be consulted fully prior to the announcement of the recommended offer.
ScotAm will also outline the board's reasons for its recommendation, the criteria used and summarise the relevant information on all ""competitive proposals"".
The circular to policyholders outlining the final bid is likely some time in May.
Abbey National sparked the auction at the end of January when it announced it was prepared to pay up to 1.4 billion pounds for ScotAm, barely two weeks after ScotAm unveiled its own proposals to drop mutual status and float on the stock market.
The Abbey offer was topped a week later by the Pru's 1.9 billion bid.
Both companies have said that their offers may be raised when they have more detailed financial information on ScotAm.

15,"Scottish Amicable's plans to float on the stock market were under threat on Friday after Abbey National launched a surprise bid for the mutually-owned life assurance company.
The offer from the retail banking group values ScotAm at up to 1.4 billion pounds ($2.25 billion) and includes an immediate minimum payout of 400 million pounds to policyholders in cash or Abbey shares.
ScotAm was quick to denounce the bid as both ""vague"" and ""inadequate"" and said it intended to press ahead with its two stage plans to drop its mutual status and float the group over the next three to five years.
Those proposals, due to be detailed in a circular within the next two weeks, have themselves been criticised for not being generous enough to policyholders while offering the prospect of a windfall to management if growth targets are met.
Under the plans the 1.1 million policyholders will receive up to 1,500 pounds while 12 ScotAm directors stand to share around 14 million pounds.
The offer from the Abbey raises the possibility of a bidding war for ScotAm, which has made no secret of past approaches.
ScotAm chairman Sandy Stewart said that indications of interest from other parties had already been received.
""As you would expect there have been quite a number of telephone calls (from other interested parties) but there have been no firm approaches,"" Stewart told Reuters.
""I suspect some of them are competitors of Abbey National"".
Stewart said Abbey National's offer had not been dismissed out of hand and that the interests of policyholders were uppermost in the management's mind.
""If we have on the table a firm offer which is quite clearly likely to be more beneficial to policyholders then we have to consider it. If we decide that is the case then we will put it to policyholders,"" Stewart said.
""At this stage the bid doesn't meet our requirements. It's vague and on the basis of what it (Abbey National) has said it appears to be inadequate.""
Analysts agreed the two businesses would fit well together and that the Abbey, with its good cash generation ability, would have no problem financing the deal.
BZW analyst Hugh Pye upgraded its recommendation on Abbey National shares on the potential offered by the deal, which he said would improve the quality of the group's earnings and return on equity.
By early afternoon the shares were trading 6-1/2 pence higher on the day at 775-1/2 pence.
Despite the rejection by Scottish Amicable, the Abbey, Britain's fifth largest bank, said it was still hoping to persuade ScotAm, which has 14 billion pounds under management, to accept the offer and put it to its policyholders.
""We believe this offer will by very attractive to Scottish Amicable policyholders, providing them with immediate value and the long-term security of being part of one of the UK's strongest financial groups,"" Abbey chief executive Peter Birch said in a statement.
No discussions have been held between the two groups and ScotAm said it had no intention of talking to the Abbey ahead of the release of details on its demutualisation. ($1=.6237 Pound)

17,"The head of the Securities and Investments Board (SIB), Britain's top financial regulator, on Friday criticised slow progress made in compensating victims of pensions mis-selling in Britain, and called on all parties to ensure a speedy conclusion to the situation.
SIB chairman, Sir Andrew Large, said that progress had hitherto been ""unacceptably slow"" but welcomed signs of increased commitments to a rapid resolution emerging from meetings with major firms.
Large's comments followed a statement from British Treasury minister Angela Knight on Thursday urging the pensions industry to speed up payment to individuals hit by pension mis-selling in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
She said that she was looking for ""rapid and decisive results from the pensions industry. Targets will be set to ensure that people are put right"".
Large said he was determined to secure redress for those missold personal pensions and welcomed any contribution which helped secure that aim.
""All parties have a responsibility for bringing this review to a speedy conclusion - the industry, the occupational pension schemes, the regulators and the government.""
Large is due to stand down as chairman of the SIB in May.
Knight's comments came just two days after the ruling Conservative Party, facing a General Election expected to be held on May 1, announced plans to overhaul the pension system in Britain.
As many as 1-1/2 million people in Britain may have been affected by being wrongly advised to take out personal pensions when they would have been better off remaining in occupational pension schemes.
An industry review was launched in 1994 but only a small proportion of those affected have so far been compensated.
Latest figures on the review published two weeks ago revealed that of nearly 500,000 ""priority cases"" just over 10,000 people had been offered compensation.
The SIB announced a simplified pensions review process last November in order to break the log-jam on the issue, but the results of this will not start feeding through until later this year.
The Personal Investment Authority, which regulates the sale of investment products to the public, has been holding discussions with major pensions providers to clear the backlog.
About 40 of the largest life companies account for around 90 percent of personal pension business. The discussions are likely to be concluded in the next three weeks.

20,"Britain's Britannic Assurance declared on Tuesday a 209 million pound ($336 million) special bonus for life insurance policies, following discussions with the government on ownership of surplus insurance funds.
The payout will apply to all ""with profits"" policies in force on February 17, 1997. Details will be given with the 1996 bonus due to be announced next month.
The company said last year it discussing with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) ownership of long-term assets, and a way to distribute the surplus to policyholders and shareholders.
Britannic has now agreed with the DTI that 902 million pounds of the excess assets within the long term fund can be attributable to shareholders.
Britannic also said it intended to increase its dividend for the year by 82 percent to 23 pence per share following an increase in life profits. This would be the basis for continuing the company's progressive dividend policy.
The news boosted Britannic shares, which jumped 71 pence, or nearly nine percent, at one stage before settling for a rise of 29 pence at 832.5.
The money attributable to shareholders forms part of total assets in the life funds which amounted to 5.682 billion pounds at the end of 1995.
Those assets were estimated to have risen by the end of 1996, Britannic chief executive Brian Shaw said, and updated figures would be released on March 18.
Britannic also announced a restructuring of its long-term funds and the results of a strategic review of its business.
The review will lead to new sales management and premium collection systems, streamlining of head office and investment in market analysis and product research.
The initiatives are expected to cut operating costs by around 25 million pounds, based on 1995 figures.
Britannic said it planned to build on its brand, investment management and distribution skills, financial strength and product development abilities to strengthen its position and improve value to policy and shareholders.
Restructuring the long-term fund will create two continuing ""with profits"" funds, one for its industrial branch and the other for the ordinary branch -- life and pensions business.
In future at least 90 percent of the surplus in the with profits funds will be allocated each year to with profits policies. The balance will be shareholders' profit for transfer to the profit and loss account.
The company has also created two separate non-profit sub funds -- one for life, one for pensions -- which will contain non-profits business and both of which will be owned by shareholders.
The shareholder transfer for 1996 will be increased by 23 million pounds following the declaration of the 209 million pound special bonus. ($ = 0.621 British Pounds)

26,"International insurance broker Willis Corroon, reported a rise in 1996 profits on Thursday but gave a gloomy assessment of the problems of overcapacity and falling rates currently afflicting the industry.
The company said insurance rates were declining almost universally and competition in the U.S. retail market was intensifying.
It also warned that the recent rise in sterling which reduced 1996 profits by 3.1 million pounds ($5.1 million) may hit 1997 results and that profits from its Lloyd's members agency were unlikely to be repeated at the 1996 level.
The comments were made as Willis unveiled pre-tax profits for the year of 91.6 million pounds, a rise of 83 percent over 1995, which included 30 million pounds in exceptional charges.
Stripping out exceptionals and disposals, profits from continuing operations were up 13 percent at 89.1 million pounds.
Willis said it expected to benefit from a programme designed to enhance performance and competitiveness but the shares lost ground after the results, slipping eight pence by early afternoon to 131-1/2 pence.
Analysts said the results merely confirmed the difficulties the sector faced.
Willis chairman John Reeve, however, pointed to the rise in profits and elimination of net debt as evidence of the successful implementation of plans to restore the group's financial health.
""The group is now focused on its core operation, following a programme of disposal, profitability has been improved and the balance sheet has been significantly strengthened,"" Reeve said.
Willis also drew comfort from its success in growing revenues and despite the difficult market conditions. it said it remained sceptical about the benefits of the recent industry trend of pursuing cost economies through mergers.
""We think there are huge risks in people businessses associated with that. We have a strategy for growing our business which we're comfortable with and as far as we're concerned that's what we're concentrating on,"" group executive director Max Taylor told Reuters in an interview.
Following the implementation of the Lloyd's of London Reconstruction and Renewal plan (R&amp;R) the group's members agency returned to profit for the first time since 1992.
The 14.5 million pound profit commission for the 1993 year included reserves from prior years. These were partly offset by contributions of 6.3 million pounds to the R&amp;R plan.
Willis said present indications were that profit commission on the 1994 year, receivable in 1997, will be around half those of 1993.
Profits for the 1995 year were likely to be significantly down, however, said one analyst, and there were big questions over whether it would be profitable at all in 1997 given the rating environment.
After severance costs of 11.3 million pounds in the 1996 figures related to the change programme, Taylor said he expected further costs in 1997 to be lower.
He said a fall in staff numbers of 11 percent in 1996 was unlikely to be repeated and further reductions were expected to be on a smaller scale and absorbed through natural wastage.
The change programme is expected to span three to five years and last year's actions were taken to underpin it. The real effort would now be going into the longer term effort of building capabilities, skills and resources, said Taylor.

28,"British life assurance group Scottish Amicable on Thursday announced plans to shed its 170-year old mutual status in preparation for a 1.0 billion pounds ($1.68 billion) flotation on the London stock market in three to five years' time.
The group, based in Stirling, Scotland, said it is to use capital raised by the two-stage proposals to take advantage of opportunities for growth and increase its share of the life and pensions market.
Policyholders are to receive an initial special bonus totalling 75 million pounds after demutualising on May 1 this year, based on the length of time policies have been held.
At the top end of the scale, an individual with a 25-year policy maturing this April will receive 1,503 pounds.
On flotation another, larger payout - expected to amount to at least 200 million pounds but possibly ""substantially higher"" - will be made.
The move to seek a flotation is the second by a British life group, following plans announced last year by Norwich Union.
Scottish Amicable had been rumoured to be a takeover candidate but chairman Sandy Stewart said the group intended to hold on to its independence.
""Our plans do not include being gobbled up by anybody,"" Stewart told a news briefing.
Industry analysts said today's move would make any takeover ""The policyholders are likely to get more by hanging on in there and having an interest in the future than a straight sale now,"" said one.
Scottish amicable said it believed the market was entering a growth phase and that it was well positioned to take advantage of an upturn but needed capital and a more flexible structure to take advantage of the opportunities.
The period before flotation is intended to allow it to develop the business and necessary profit-focused corporate culture.
Managing Director Roy Nicolson said that there remained value to be realised in the group and that an immediate flotation would have failed to reflect the true value of the business and sold policyholders short.
Industry analysts described the proposals as a good compromise between raising some capital in the near term but not selling out too cheap.
Under the proposals, the business, staff and operations of the group are to be transferred to a new company, Scottish Amicable Life, a 100 percent owned subsidiary of the newly formed Scottish Amicable Holdings.
Nicolson, is to become group chief executive of a new holding company Scottish Amicable Holdings. Paul Bradshaw, deputy managing director, will become chief executive of Scottish Amicable Life.
The first stage of the group's plans involves a deal with reinsurance giant Swiss Re and its affiliate Securitas Capital to provide an injection of cash of 395 million poounds.
Scottish Amicable's existing with-profit fund will receive an immediate cash contribution of 350 million pounds while Securitas Capital will invest up to 45 million pounds in return for approximately 20 percent of a new business fund being set up to transact all new business leading up to flotation.
The plans have to be approved by three-quarters of policyholders who vote and a special general meeting is expected to be held in March.

31,"Shares in British insurer Commercial Union (CU) jumped on Friday amid renewed speculation the insurance group may become the next victim in the industry's push to consolidate.
Rumours that a merger were in the offing were given a new lease of life after buying of CU shares late on Thursday. The shares rose on Friday, jumping in late trading to close 19-1/2p at 663-1/2p, ignoring worries about interest rates which sent stock prices across the rest of the London market tumbling.
Tobacco and financial sevices giant BAT Industries has been at the centre of the most recent rumours with reports last weekend that discussions between the two had foundered.
Both companies have maintained their silence on whether discussions have actually taken place but earlier this week BAT said it was keeping an open mind about the opportunities for finding a partner for its financial services arm.
The search for cost savings and economies of scale are behind the latest drive to consolidate in Britain's increasingly competitive and fragmented insurance industry.
New entrants selling insurance over the telephone such as Direct Line have added to competition while the selling of insurance products through banks, building societies and shops is also expected to gather momentum.
Royal Insurance and Sun Alliance combined operations back in July to create Britain's biggest insurer and estimates it will be able to cut costs by 175 million pounds ($289.6 million) annually by 1998, shedding some 5,000 employees in the process.
Like the retail banking industry, insurance companies tend not to be dependent on key individuals and mergers are not fundamentally difficult to achieve, said analysts.
One estimated that cost savings in a tie-up between Commercial Union and BAT Industries could probably add another 20 percent to combined operating profits.
While analysts conceded that reports the company has been discussing a deal with others in the industry may be true, they were quick to point out that such discussions have been commonplace in recent years.
""Anyone who wanted to talk to CU would at least be listened to -- they've got shareholders to consider. But these things are not new. These companies have been talking to each other for as long as I can remember on a regular basis,"" said one analyst.
""But I think CU feels quite capable of controlling its own destiny and I'm not convinced that they would think another insurance company had much to offer.""
The question of which management would come out on top in any merger is another tricky issue and was said to have been behind the breakdown in talks with BAT.
Interest from abroad has also been rumoured with German insurance group Allianz said to have been contemplating a move for CU. General Accident and Guardian Royal Exchange have also been linked with CU.
A full-scale takeover is a more remote possibility with the necessary premium on the current share price likely to offset many of the cost savings.
But even a merger would bring with it a multitude of problems and would put questionmarks over relationships built up with banks and financial institutions in its continental European businesses.
""There's pressure on both the non-life and life industries to get together and cut costs and CU is as much a part of that as anybody else. I'm sure that most companies have talked or thought about talking to other companies. Whether anything comes of it or not is a completely different matter,"" said an analyst.
Takeover talk also extended to the insurance broking market late Friday as rumours circulated of a predator stalking Sedgwick Group Plc whose shares closed 5p higher at 125-1/2p.

36,"Abbey National on Monday called for Scottish Amicable to put on hold proposals to drop its mutual status and allow policyholders time to consider last week's offer for the life assurance group.
But ScotAm were quick to reject the demand together with renewed requests by Abbey for access to its books.
ScotAm said it had no intention of altering its plans and would proceed according to its own timetable and not one dictated by Abbey.
""They're asking for privileged access to information before policyholders,"" said a ScotAm spokesman.
""The policyholders have to get that information, see the detail of what we're offering and at that time Abbey can make a proper judgement of its offer.""
The details of ScotAm's demutualisation and flotation plans are due to be published at the beginning of next week.
Until then an impasse looks likely with ScotAm refusing to discuss Abbey's approach and Abbey prevented from seeing more detailed financial information it says it needs.
It argues that policyholders should have the opportunity to compare ScotAm's plans with alternative offers based on the same information.
""Ours is a firm offer based on published information and it is a minimum offer. If we had the information they have, we'd be on the same level playing field,"" said an Abbey spokesman.
""The policyholders should be given the chance to vote on the best deal on the table. If Scottish know there's a firm offer from us - and there may be other interested parties - they should consider all of these and put them to policyholders at one go.""
Many industry observers expect the move by Abbey which already owns Glasgow-based Scottish Mutual, to prompt an auction for ScotAm with interest anticipated from both Britain and overseas.
Insurance group Prudential has said it was ""watching the situation with interest"" and has made no secret that it is on the lookout for an acquisition in the life assuarnce sector.
Britain's Halifax building society, high street banking group National Westminster, Fortis, the Dutch-Belgian financial services company, and Dutch firm ING Groep have all declined to comment on reports they might throw their hats in the ring.
No talks have been held with any other parties and according to the ScotAm, none are planned ahead of the publication of its proposals. For the time being at least, the company remains dismissive of Abbey's approach.
It has repeatedly attacked what it describes as the ""vagueness"" of Abbey's offer - a minimum of 400 million pounds ($641 million) and between 700 million and one billion pounds for the embedded value of the with-profits fund.
But the company was keen to stress that the interests of policyholders remained the most important consideration and if a suitable offer emerged it would be put to policyholders.
""The kite being flown by Abbey has all the superficial attractions of an upfront cash offer to policyholders without any assurance of the long term welfare of policies,"" ScotAm chairman Sandy Stewart told Reuters.
""Abbey has said more to the press than it has put in writing to the board and that should alert policyholders that it's time for very careful reflection.""
While ScotAm may be irked at what it sees as the way Abbey has conducted its bid through the press, Abbey contend it is the only way it can get its message across to policyholders. ($1=.6237 Pound)

41,"Fund manager Nicola Horlick's row with her ex-employer Morgan Grenfell Asset Management (MGAM) continued to be played out in public on Wednesday as she admitted that she had been in talks with a rival banking group until several days before she was suspended.
But Horlick stressed that the talks with Dutch firm ABN AMRO were of an ""informal and preliminary nature"" and at no time had she provided confidential information about the business or colleagues.
""The talks terminated several days before I was suspended,"" said Horlick. ""My aim was always to keep the clients and the team together for the benefit of all.""
The benefit of all included MGAM whom, she said, she had never intended to leave.
Horlick, one of London's most prominent fund managers, resigned last week after being suspended amid allegations she planned to defect to ABN AMRO and was soliciting MGAM colleagues to go with her.
The suspension came just days after she had been promoted to be managing director of MGAM and since then her fight to be reinstated or compensated for the loss of her job has rarely been out of the headlines.
Once again the lure of the cameras proved difficult to resist on Wednesday and in a television interview, Horlick repeated her determination to clear her name.
""When you're faced with the fact that people are saying that you've done something wrong and you know you haven't you have to fight for yourself. It's one individual versus a very large bank,"" she said. ""All I have is my reputation and I must defend myself.""
The 35 year-old mother-of-five's battle with MGAM has raised eyebrows in the traditionally discreet and conservative banking industry but she maintained she saw no alternative to the action she had taken.
Horlick was catapulted onto the front pages last Friday when she turned up on MGAM's doorstep with a posse of journalists to confront her former employyers after her resignation.
Later to the surprise of everbody -- including her own lawyers -- she flew to Frankfurt to put her case to officials at MGAM's parent company Deutsche Bank.
ABN AMRO has denied trying to poach Horlick and her team and today said they had nothing to add to earlier statements.
Horlick has been in talks with her lawyers for the past few days and is considering taking legal action against her former employer for constructive dismissal.
MGAM is holding fast to its line that it will not reinstate Horlick nor offer compensation since she took the decision to resign her position.

54,"Synopsys Inc. said Thursday it agreed to buy Epic Design Technology Inc. for about $428.1 million in stock to gain expertise in a hot niche of the semiconductor design business.
Synopsys, which writes software to help engineers design computer chips, said it will issue 0.7485 of its shares for each of Epic's 13.7 million shares outstanding. Based on Synopsys's closing stock price of $41.75 on Wednesday, Synopsys would pay about $31.25 for each Epic share.
Shares of Epic, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., fell 87.5 cents to $31 in late Nasdaq trading. Shares of Synopsys, based in Mountain View, Calif., were unchanged at $41.75, also on Nasdaq.
Synopsys specializes in software used in designing the overall framework of a microchip. Epic specializes in software for designing individual microscopic circuits, millions of which make up the microchip.
The acquisition gives Synopsys an edge as the so-called design automation industry scrambles to come up with ways to help engineers design ever smaller chips, analysts said.
""We believe the Epic acquisition is a good strategic move,"" said Raj Seth, analyst at Cowen &amp; Co. in Boston. ""Synopsys picks up technologies that are increasingly critical to developing"" the tiny ""deep submicron"" circuits.
Synopsys' customers, which include some of the world's biggest chip makers, have been asking for a suite of design software that would let engineers design a chip's framework as well as its circuits, said Aart de Geus, Synopsys chief executive.
Epic will become a unit of Synopsys, the companies said. Sang Wang, Epic chairman and CEO, will head the unit.
Synopsys will take an undetermined charge for the acquisition in the quarter the transaction is done, ""ideally March,"" said Brooke Seawell, Synopsys chief financial officer. Because of little overlapping products, there should be no Epic job cuts, Seawell said.

55,"At this year's Comdex computer trade show, the most sought-after people are not Microsoft Corp.'s Bill Gates or Intel Corp.'s Andy Grove, but corporate computer buyers.
Personal computer makers and software vendors are relying heavily on their corporate customers this year to make up for disappointing sales to consumers, executives at the trade show said this week.
While many consumers have been putting off their computer shopping until early 1997 -- when new gadgets come out -- corporate customers are finally dumping their older PCs and buying lots of machines that can run the latest business software from Microsoft.
""Certainly we see a tremendously strong business environment as a major upgrade cycle is now occurring,"" said Michael Winkler, senior vice president at Compaq Computer Corp.. ""We think the fourth quarter will be excellent.""
Winkler and other PC executives said the recent release of Microsoft's Windows NT operating system and Office 97 package of business programmes was fuelling corporate sales. These programmes work best with the computing horsepower of machines based on Intel's top-of-the-line Pentium computer chip.
In large part because of strong corporate sales, domestic PC shipments in the fourth quarter were expected to rise 20 percent to 8 million units, according to International Data Corp., a market researcher.
""The bottom line here is that the outlook for '97 for our business is very strong,"" said Jim McDonnell, a group marketing manager of PCs at Hewlett-Packard Co..
Based on executives' bullish comments at Comdex this week, stocks of most PC makers have gained in recent days.
Compaq rose $1.375 to $81.875 and International Business Machines Corp. jumped $2.50 to $156.25, both on the New York Stock Exchange, while Intel added $1.75 to $122.50 and Sun Microsystems Inc. gained $2.50 to $59.50, both on Nasdaq.
Still, the fourth quarter has been disappointing to some PC makers, especially those that concentrate heavily on consumer sales.
Last year this time, the release of Microsoft's Windows 95, software that makes PCs easier to use, drew lots of people to computer stores to buy their first PCs. The industry has no such attraction this year.
In fact, analysts said, consumers were putting off computer shopping this Christmas season as the industry prepares new machines based on Intel's upcoming MMX technology. MMX-based machines, slated to be released in early 1997, will feature better video, sound and 3-D graphics.
In late October, computer stocks slid as CompUSA Inc. and other computer retailers reported softening sales heading into the crucial Christmas season.
""There's no question that the quarter started out slow, but we're hopeful that things are getting better,"" said Mal Ransom, senior vice president of marketing at closely held Packard Bell NEC Inc., the second-biggest PC maker in the United States behind Compaq.
Consumer sales appear to be improving as it gets closer to Christmas, while prices of computer components remain low, Ransom said. ""It looks like we're going to get a reasonable quarter.""

The companies said their Open Financial Exchange -- a set of technical specifications -- will make it easier for depositors' personal computers to communicate with bank computers. That makes it easier to pay bills, transfer money between accounts and get balances via the Internet.
About 50 banks are expected to announce by fall that they will adopt the standard, said Intuit Executive Vice President Bill Harris. By then, each of the three companies also will unveil new lines of online banking products based on the standard.
Intuit and Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft, fierce competitors since a merger agreement between them fell apart almost two years ago, said that by working together they will accelerate the adoption of online banking.

62,"Apple Computer Inc. plans to release a new line of computers as early as 1998 that will run an operating system written from scratch, Chief Executive Gilbert Amelio said on Wednesday.
The new operating system -- the fundamental software that controls the basic functions of the computer -- will leapfrog Microsoft Corp.'s competing family of Windows software, Amelio told investors at the American Electronics Association conference in Monterey.
""When you are the minority player in the marketplace, as we are, you need something other than market share to distinguish yourself,"" Amelio said.
Amelio declined to specify what the new software would look like or how it would outperform Windows. But he promised it would ""completely change the way"" people get their work done on computers through applications, such as word processing and spreadsheets.
Earlier this year, Apple said it would abandon the overhaul of its Macintosh operating system, an effort code-named Copland. Apple programmers will use some of the components of Copland but will practically start from scratch, Amelio said.
Amelio also told investors, as he has done recently, that increasing the struggling computer maker's revenue and market share would not be a priority until he could improve the company's operations and product lines.
The effort may take until 1998.
""I have to have a solid foundation before I can build a castle,"" Amelio said. Without a solid foundation, Apple would improve its financial performance for one or two quarters but slide again, he said.
Apple, whose headquarters are in Cupertino, California, reported an unexpected profit of $25 million for the last three months of fiscal 1996, down from a profit of $60 million a year ago. Many on Wall Street had expected the company to post a loss for the quarter.
Investors have given Amelio credit for moving quickly to improve product quality, cut costs and fix production snafus. Apple is likely to report good progress in the next two quarters as well, said Michael Murphy, president of the California Technology Stock Letter and an investment fund. it faces ""worrisome"" quarters after March, Murphy added.
""Amelio's getting closer to fixing the company's problems,"" he said, ""but we're not going to go back in yet.""

67,"Apple Computer Inc. Wednesday reported a $120 million loss in its fiscal first quarter and warned investors it did not expect to report a profit until September.
The troubled computer maker, based in Cupertino, Calif., also said it expected revenue for the current fiscal year, which ends next September, to drop about 13 percent to $8 billion to $8.5 billion because of weak consumer sales.
Apple's loss, which equaled 96 cents a share, compared with a loss of $69 million, or 56 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Sales for the quarter ended Dec. 27 fell to $2.13 billion from $3.15 billion.
Apple attributed the latest quarterly loss to slow sales of consumer-oriented Performa desktop computers during the crucial Christmas quarter, which analysts said was partly due to concerns about Apple's future.
""Apple's been under a black cloud, and part of it has been Apple's doing,"" said Lou Mazzucchelli, analyst at brokerage Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York. ""It's hard for a consumer to get the gumption to buy a Performa when everyone's asking, 'Is Apple dead yet?'""
Apple officials said the company will unveil in coming weeks its second restructuring program in two years, aimed at cutting operating costs by $400 million.
The plan could include more job cuts, Chief Financial Officer Fred Anderson said. Apple wants to reduce its break-even point to $8 billion in annual revenues to enable it to return to profitability by the end of September.
Previously, Apple had promised to return to sustainable profits by March. But industry analysts had started to question that goal after Apple disclosed less than two weeks ago that sales of its Performa line were running behind plan.
Apple, which posted a record loss last year of $816 million, has been struggling to return to profitability in the face of increased competition from computers using Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating system and Intel Corp.'s computer chips.
Last February, Apple replaced Chief Executive Michael Spindler with National Semiconductor Corp. boss Gilbert Amelio and then, in December, announced a reunion with former co-founder Steven Jobs when it agreed to acquire Job's Next Software Inc. for $400 million.
Meanwhile, debt rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's lowered Apple's corporate credit and debt rating another notch Wednesday, putting the company's debt further into junk bond status.
The rating agency said the downgrade reflected the challenges facing Apple, including reducing costs and restoring revenue growth, executing a cohesive operating system upgrade upon completion of the Next acquisition, and Apple's diminished liquidity and financial resources.
""Despite its position among the top five worldwide personal computer manufacturers ... Apple has been struggling with extremely competitive industry conditions, slipping market share, and operating losses,"" the rating agency said.
Despite the slowdown in Performa sales, Anderson said Apple's financial position remained strong.
""While we were very disappointed by the Performa sales results and the associated loss, our financial position remains sound,"" he said. ""We exited the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash.""
Anderson said there were some bright spots in its results. European shipments rose 50 percent in the first quarter from the fourth quarter. Sales to educational organizations also were above the company's goals, Anderson said.
Still, Performa sales, which account for about a third of Apple's revenues, will be weak for the rest of the year. ""We had a major problem in this one product area,"" he said.
Analysts said the loss, which Apple forecast two weeks ago, represented a setback for Amelio. He had set a goal of stanching Apple's losses in 1996 and getting revenue growing again by 1998.
News of the latest loss can drive even more consumers to avoid buying Apple products, analysts said.
""The question is, can Apple wait until 1998 to get its growth engine going again?"" said Walter Winnitzki, analyst at broker PaineWebber Inc. in New York.
Apple reported its results after the market closed. Apple closed at $17.25 a share, down 62.5 cents, on Nasdaq.

74,"Jilted once, financial software company Intuit Inc appears unlikely to return to the merger altar any time soon.
Buyout speculation has swirled around Intuit since May 1995, when Microsoft Corp. dumped its plans to buy the maker of popular personal finance software like Quicken and TurboTax. Last week, Intuit shares surged again on speculation American Express Co. was about to make an offer.  
However, many industry analysts believe such a deal is not in Intuit's future, adding the best way for Intuit to grow is to attract as many partners as it can to set up online banking services.
""My personal belief is that Intuit is best able to maximize its value on its own,"" said David Farina, an analyst at William Blair.
Intuit's key asset is Quicken, a program that helps computer users track checkbook balances, check stock portfolios, pay bills, plan monthly budgets and lay out retirement plans.  
The company depends on partnerships with dozens of banks and brokerages to provide online links between customers' personal computers and their accounts.
Intuit would turn off most of its partners if it were acquired by a big financial partner, Scott Cook, Intuit's chairman, insists.
""We would never become a captive of one financial institution or a small group of financial institutions,"" Cook told a group of investors in Florida on Friday.  
Still, some analysts questioned whether Intuit has the marketing and financial muscle to compete on its own against Microsoft for long.
Microsoft, the world's biggest personal computer software company, is spending a big chunk of its $2 billion research and development budget on financial software and online banking services provided through the Internet.
Although Intuit still controls 70 percent of the market for personal financial software, Microsoft is gaining.  
Intuit also needs capital to expand into new area, such as giving online investment advice, said Karen Epper, an analyst at Forrester Research, a market researcher. Such forays will likely hurt profits, she said.
""They might get dinged on their stock price, but this area is more in line with the consumer marketing business model they have,"" Epper said.
It could be years, however, before Intuit's push into new areas could pay off, Epper said.
Intuit said in September it expects lower revenue growth in the current fiscal year ending July 1997.  
The company blamed a slow market for consumer software. Some of the shortfall is because of one-time suitor Microsoft, analysts said.
In October 1994, Microsoft stunned Wall Street by offering to buy Intuit for more than $1 billion, the biggest acquisition attempt in the software industry at the time.
Microsoft was willing to pay that huge sum to turn Quicken into a gateway for online banking services, an industry that's expected to rival brick-and-mortar retail banking in revenue in the next ten years.  
Microsoft backed out of the deal in May 1995, however, when the Justice Department said it would sue Microsoft on antitrust grounds if it pursued the transaction.
Since then, Microsoft has spent hundreds of millions beefing up its rival Microsoft Money financial management program. The company also set up a division to sell networking and Internet software to banks.
To counter Microsoft's redoubled efforts, Intuit set up a business to process online transactions -- such as bill payments and account transfers -- between banks and depositors. Some investors saw the unit, Intuit Services Corp., as a promising source of revenue.
In September, however, Intuit sold the unit to rival Checkfree Corp., partly because it did not have the expertise to handle huge volumes of transactions.
Banks also were reluctant to have Intuit sit between them and their depositors, Epper said. Most banks preferred to reach their customers through the Internet instead of Intuit's proprietary network.
""Intuit is staring down the barrel of a gun, and that gun is the Internet, which is making financial management easier,"" Epper said.
It could be a while before Intuit outlines a new strategy for growing its business, analysts said.
Meanwhile, there may be more bouts of wishful thinking about an acquisition, they said.

79,"Database software company Informix Corp. said Friday it filed a lawsuit against Oracle Corp., accusing its bigger rival of stealing trade secrets by hiring away its employees.
Oracle hired 11 Informix employees from Informix's Portland, Ore., research and development centre. All 11 workers quit on Wednesday morning, said Informix Chief Executive Phil White.
Informix stock fell $1.50, or 6.6 percent, to $21.375 in active trading on Nasdaq. Oracle stock fell 87.5 cents to $39.625, also on Nasdaq.
""This is a blatant effort by Oracle,"" said White. ""They're behind significantly technically. We're not going to let someone who's significantly behind technically just buy his way in.""
Oracle officials called the lawsuit ""ridiculous"" and said the 11 programmers approached Oracle on their own. They also had approached Microsoft Corp. about jobs, said Jerry Held, Oracle senior vice president of server technologies.
""This is a group of senior developers that was very frustrated by the lack of vision of Informix top managers,"" Held said. ""We did no active recruiting. I was called absolutely out of the blue"" when the former Informix staff joined Oracle.
The lawsuit, filed on Thursday in Oregon Circuit Court in Portland, seeks unspecified damages. Informix on Thursday also obtained a temporary injunction barring the former employees from giving trade secrets to Oracle, Informix said.
Informix also charged Gary Kelley, a former Informix product development vice president who left for Oracle, with breach of contract. Kelley did not return phone calls to Oracle's Portland facility.
Informix, based in Menlo Park, Calif., and Oracle, based 20 miles north in Redwood Shores, Calif., both write sophisticated programmes that store and retrieve huge amounts of information in corporate computer networks.
The companies for years have been fighting a marketing war touting their advances in database technology with each new release of their respective flagship products.
White said he believed Oracle was interested in gaining Informix's expertise in writing software for so-called massively parallel computers -- top-of-the-line machines that can process huge amounts of transactions simultaneously.
The 11 Informix employees who left for Oracle were working on this type of product, White said.
Held said Oracle does not have an interest in Informix's technology because Oracle is ahead in that area.
""Oracle has had parallel technology for years,"" Held said. ""Informix is playing catch-up. Phil has a knack for being behind and saying he's ahead.""
Technology debates aside, the spat is the most serious between the companies in years. White, normally a publicity-shy executive, said he was livid about Oracle's tactics and intended to make the lawsuit a political cause in Silicon Valley for preventing employee raids.
White said he personally went to the home of Oracle Chief Executive Larry Ellison on Thursday night to discuss the issue, but Ellison was in Hong Kong. Both men live in the same small town in Silicon Valley.
""I'm doing this not only for Informix and for our shareholders but also for the industry,"" White said. ""We can't let companies come in and throw big financial incentives and walk away with intellectual property we spent hundreds of millions of dollars developing.""
In recent years, several software rivals in Silicon Valley have accused each other of trade secret theft by employee snatching.
In 1992, Borland International Inc. accused a former employee of sending confidential electronic mail to new employer Symantec Corp.. Last year, Cadence Design Systems Inc.. filed a similar charges against direct competitor Avant Corp..
The court has set a hearing in the Informix case for Feb. 7.

81,"Bay Networks Inc., keeping up with rivals in the computer networking business, said Wednesday it paid $99 million in cash and stock to buy closely held NetICs Inc.
The acquisition gives Bay Networks a line of devices called Fast Ethernet switches that are becoming increasingly popular with computer technicians for speeding up the flow of information through corporate computer networks.
Bay Networks' rivals Cisco Systems Inc. and 3Com Corp. have bought similar Fast Ethernet technology in recent months.
Bay Networks, based in Santa Clara, Calif., agreed to pay about $55 million in stock and $44 million in cash for NetICs, a company that has yet to report any revenue. Bay will charge ""a substantial portion"" of the purchase price against earnings for its quarter ending in December, the company said.
Bay Networks' stock was off 12.5 cents at $21.50 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
The acquisition keeps Bay Networks up to date with rapidly emerging technology, said Dick Eyestone, its senior vice president. ""We live in dog years in this industry. Six months is like forever,"" he said.
Eyestone, who will oversee NetICs' operation as a Bay Networks unit, said his company plans to use NetICs' designs in its own line of networking products. Bay will release the first product from the acquisition in the first quarter.
NetICs, formed in 1995 by a dozen engineers, will remain in Acton, Mass. Until now, NetICs has been developing its technology and has not had any revenue, said Gary Vacon, NetICs founder and president.
Some analysts said they were surprised by the amount of money Bay was willing to pay to get its hands on the technology.
""I know companies with revenues in this sector that would be happy to get $30 million,"" said Steve Koffler, an analyst at NatWest Securities in New York. ""They obviously felt they need this technology.""
Bay Networks executives said they are paying the standard price for high-tech startups.
""This is right in line with the industry standard and our expectations,"" said Bill Ruehle, Bay Networks chief financial officer. He declined to say how much revenue he expects NetICs products to generate.

85,"Apple Computer Inc. said Tuesday it plans to to work with a restaurant operator to open cybercafes in the United States and Europe starting late next year.
The third-biggest maker of personal computers licensed its name and famous half-eaten apple logo to London-based Mega Bytes International BVI, a developer of theme parks. Mega Bytes will develop a high-tech chain of eateries where patrons can surf the Internet, play games and eat.
Apple said the restaurants are part of its plan to spread its famous brand into the everyday world, as other non-gourmet companies, such as Harley-Davidson Motorcyles and Nike Inc., have done.
The first restaurant, slated to open in Los Angeles in late 1997, will flaunt Apple's computers at every table, the company said. Customers can browse the World Wide Web with high-speed access, check out the latest CD-ROM titles and send e-mail.
Restaurants in London, Paris, New York, Tokyo and other cities will follow, Apple said.
Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., will only make money from the licensing agreement, an Apple spokeswoman said. Terms of the agreement weren't disclosed. Mega Bytes will run the restaurants.

86,"Synopsys Inc. said Thursday it agreed to buy Epic Design Technology Inc. for about $428.1 million in stock to gain expertise in a hot niche of the semiconductor design business.
Synopsys, which writes software to help engineers design computer chips, said it will issue 0.7485 of its shares for each of Epic's 13.7 million shares outstanding. Based on Synopsys's closing stock price of $41.75 on Wednesday, Synopsys would pay about $31.25 for each Epic share.
Shares of Epic, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., fell 87.5 cents to $31 in late Nasdaq trading. Shares of Synopsys, based in Mountain View, Calif., were unchanged at $41.75, also on Nasdaq.
Synopsys specialises in software used in designing the overall framework of a microchip. Epic specialises in software for designing individual microscopic circuits, millions of which make up the microchip.
The acquisition gives Synopsys an edge as the so-called design automation industry scrambles to come up with ways to help engineers design ever smaller chips, analysts said.
""We believe the Epic acquisition is a good strategic move,"" said Raj Seth, analyst at Cowen &amp; Co. in Boston. ""Synopsys picks up technologies that are increasingly critical to developing"" the tiny ""deep submicron"" circuits.
Synopsys' customers, which include some of the world's biggest chip makers, have been asking for a suite of design software that would let engineers design a chip's framework as well as its circuits, said Aart de Geus, Synopsys chief executive.
Epic will become a unit of Synopsys, the companies said. Sang Wang, Epic chairman and CEO, will head the unit.
Synopsys will take an undetermined charge for the acquisition in the quarter the transaction is done, ""ideally March,"" said Brooke Seawell, Synopsys chief financial officer. Because of little overlapping products, there should be no Epic job cuts, Seawell said.

A host of companies will introduce second-generation handheld computers, about the size of paperbacks, which can do much of the work their desktop counterparts handle.
The trade show, expected to draw 250,000 people to Las Vegas next week, also will feature the digital video disc, or DVD, an advanced compact disc for playing movies and storing computer information.
In addition International Business Machines Corp., Microsoft Corp. and other industry giants are expected to take their year-old battle over rival approaches to simplifying personal computers to the trade show floor.
Moreso than in recent years, this year's show will highlight how the PC, the centre of a $400 billion global industry, is moving into new venues such as the living room entertainment cabinet, shirt pockets and the backs of airline seats, industry executives said.
""As more and more of the population gains experience with PCs, the types of products consumers select will diversify, and the major players have to accommodate them,"" said Tom Grueskin, marketing manager at computer maker Gateway 2000 Inc.
Microsoft will kick off Comdex on Sunday night with the introduction of Windows CE, a computer programme that will run on handheld computers. Several companies, including Compaq Computer Corp., NEC Corp. and LG Electronics Inc. will unveil devices using the software.
The handheld PCs represent the industry's second big push in four years to sell tiny computers for managing appointments and contacts and keeping in touch with the office.
Analysts said the new more powerful machines will let users do things earlier models were not good at, such as writing lengthy e-mail and tapping the Internet. Microsoft has made strides in making it easier for the handhelds to share information with desktops, analysts said.
Microsoft also will unveil Microsoft Office 97, a major revision of its top-selling package of business programmes. The product will be one of the biggest revenue generators for the world's biggest PC software company, analysts said.
Consumer electronics companies will crash Comdex this year to formally introduce DVD. The technology is based on compact discs similar to music CDs, but with many times the storage capacity.
Next year, Toshiba Corp., Sony Corp., Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. and several other companies will sell DVDs that can play movies and music.
At Comdex, the computer arms of the consumer electronics companies will unveil DVD storage devices that plug into PCs. The so-called DVD-ROM players are expected to spur development of video games that use sophisticated 3-D animation.
By the middle of next year, high-end consumer PCs will be equipped with DVD-ROM players, said Paul Dempsey, senior vice president at Pioneer Electronic Corp.'s New Media division. Several game software companies will have DVD-based products ready to show at Comdex.
By early 1998, some DVD-equipped laptops may even be able to play full-length, full-screen movies, analysts said.
Comdex may also become an arena this year for competing versions of so-called network computers -- bare bones PCs that get most of their computing power from corporate or public computer networks.
IBM will introduce several network computers, geared toward corporate customers who need simple terminals for data entry and customer service tasks.
Meanwhile, Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates and Intel Corp. Chief Executive Andy Grove may give some details in keynote speeches about their companies' plans to redesign the guts of the PC to make them easier to maintain and upgrade.
Both Gates and Groves had pooh-poohed the concept of the network computer, but decided to take a second look when it became clear consumers were intrigued by the possibility of no-brainer PCs.

102,"Emaciated refining margins and soaring demand have forced China to raise domestic prices on gasoil effective Friday, Chinese oil sources said.
Sinopec earlier confirmed the ex-refinery price for diesel, or gasoil, was being raised to 1,990 yuan per tonne from 1,900 yuan.
This is the first time prices have been raised since ceilings on domestic refined product prices were introduced in May 1994 to lock in margins for domestic refiners.  
""If prices are not raised, refineries, especially those along the coast cannot survive,"" a trader with state refiner Sinopec said by telephone.
""Refineries have lobbied for a long time for prices to be raised,"" he said, adding mainland refiners had been reeling from soaring crude bills this year.
Chinese refiners have been holding back importS of crude oil in international markets this year.  
Prompt prices of North Sea Brent, a global benchmark, are currently $24.20 per barrel. Earlier this week they hit a five-year high of $25.06 per barrel -- representing a 57 percent rise in prices from the low of this year of $15.93.
Asian benchmark Tapis crude is currently valued at five-year highs of $26.40 per barrel -- a 35 percent increase on the 1996 low of $19.45.
Chinese refineries have also been afflicted by a 110 yuan increase in domestic crude prices since January to between 864 and 794 yuan per tonne.  
Sources said it was not immediately clear whether prices of other petroleum products would move up in tandem as Beijing had initially been reluctant to approve the diesel increase due to fear of causing an inflationary backlash.
Other Sinopec sources said the move may be intended to encourage domestic production of more gasoil, over higher-valued products such as gasoline.
""Sales of gasoil are very brisk, the moment it's out it's sold, refineries are just not producing enough to satisfy demand,"" a source with the coastal Fujian refinery said.

107,"Long before Hong Kong's handover to China, celebrity painter Liu Yu Yi, whose portrait subjects include Beijing's leaders, is already benefiting from the return of Britain's last Asian outpost to the Chinese fold.
Spanning an entire wall in his home in Hong Kong's posh Mid-levels district is an almost finished oil painting depicting over 200 famous personalities at a feast celebrating the handover at midnight on June 30.
Central on the canvas is China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, the man hailed as the architect of the ""one country, two systems"" formula under which Hong Kong would be treated after the handover.
Raising a toast, Deng is flanked by President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng and Tung Chee-hwa, the man who will run Hong Kong after Britain hands back its colony of more than 150 years.
""I am using art to capture this momentous event that is watched by all nations of the world,"" Liu, reclining on a sofa, told Reuters during an interview.
THE CHINA BREAKTHROUGH
Trained at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing, Liu shot to fame in 1993 when he sold ""Liang Xiao"" (Festive Evening) -- a flashback to a historic gathering of China's leaders in 1950 -- for HK$8.36 million (US$1.08 million).
It was the highest price paid for a contemporary Chinese work of art, and he has been hitting jackpots ever since.
He sold ""Song of the Goddess Nu Wa"" for HK$8.88 million in 1994 and ""Gathering of Immortals"" for HK$10.8 million in 1995.
THE HONGKONG CONNECTION
Whether because of his talent, access to high places or being in the right place at the right time, Liu has penetrated the ranks of the rich and influential since coming to Hong Kong in 1991.
Liu, whose entire family lived on his monthly wage of 40 yuan (US$4.80) in the 1970s, has done portraits of Hong Kong business titans such as Li Ka-shing, Stanley Ho, Simon Li, Gordon Wu and Run Run Shaw.
Mindful of the handover five months away, Hong Kong's rich and pragmatic have been embracing their mainland peers, be they politicians, businessmen or artists, and are stocking up their homes with Chinese art and antiques.
But the well-connected Liu, who drew Tung into his work on the handover more than five months before the tycoon was even selected as Hong Kong's first colonial leader, betrayed little when asked what sparked the insight.
""I just thought he was the likeliest candidate,"" he chuckled before adding that the dozen empty headslots would be drawn in after Tung announces his team-designate.
SUCCESS DIDN'T COME EASY
Liu's real break came in 1988 when ""Festive Evening"" was exibited in the Memorial Hall of the late Chinese leader Mao Zedong.
It prompted a request from Beijing for Liu to create another work. The resulting ""Ren Min Wan Sui"" or ""Long Live The People"" has adorned Beijing's Tiananmen Rostrum since 1990.
But all this did not come easy for the artist who was sent off to toil in a rural commune during the ultra-leftist years of the Mao-inspired Cultural Revolution (1966-1976).
""I suffered tremendous shock, persecution. They said I was a 'black' artist, that I did not conform politically,"" Liu said.
""Seven years. Seven years I lost time to practise my art. I only came back in 1977, then I painted again,"" he said.
CULTURAL REVOLUTION HARDSHIPS PROVIDED INSPIRATION
Ironically, it was those years of persecution and aimless toil that inspired ""Liang Xiao"", his first work after the end of the revolution, and a piece which would take him till 1984.
""After the Cultural Revolution, I wanted to say many things which had been locked in my heart. I saw all the chaos and fighting. I was very depressed and I suffered a lot,"" Liu said.
""I knew this can never be repeated. I wished that it would be 'liang xiao' every night. That every night would be wonderful and whole for the country. That was what I wanted to say.""
Things have looked up since for Liu, whose works echo the leanings of socialist realism, a creed that was hammered into intellectuals and artists during the late 1950s.
Snubbing the formulaic mountains, valleys, bamboo trees and the miniature people of lofty Chinese landscape art, Liu said: ""These works have lasted for too long in China. From the Song Dynasty onwards, too many, too many.
""Under my hand, my pursuit is different...that of entry into the world, not retreat. To immerse into this world,"" he said.
FELLOW ARTISTS AND CRITICS LESS KIND
While Liu's talent as a portrait painter is admired, the material success that his brushes have brought more than just raised eyebrows from those in his trade.
Gallery owner Karl McLean, who helped sell ""Song of the Goddess Nu Wa"", said: ""He's a very good portrait painter, and has very good connections in Beijing...but the artists hate him, they think he is just political and very commercial.
""I think he's a very clever guy, he's a very smart guy. He knows how to make money and he knows how to handle the rich. He knows how to get them to pay up big time,"" McLean told Reuters. (US$1 = HK$7.73)

The bad weather failed to dampen an outburst of nationalistic pride as dragons, lions and unicorns -- Chinese symbols of luck and joy -- pranced to the deafening clash of cymbals and drums.
More than 7,000 people of all ages from more than 100 pro-Beijing community organisations took part in the parade which wound through busy streets on Hong Kong island.
When Hong Kong, a British colony for more than 150 years, returns to China, it will become a Special Administrative Region (SAR) governed by its own Chief Executive and promised considerable autonomy in running its affairs.
""This is a grand and great occasion. In just 100 days, we will return to the Chinese motherland,"" said chief organiser Raymond Wu at the start of the rally which gathered in Victoria Park -- named after the British queen who reigned when Britain seized Hong Kong from a weak China in the 19th century.
""We welcome the washing away of over a century of humiliation and shame,"" Wu said to a burst of applause.
The present Queen's head is disappearing from the territory's coins and stamps. Victoria Park will be renamed Central Park after the handover.
Few of the merry-makers as much as glanced at the massive bronze statute of Victoria in the park as they left for a march through the streets.
Sporting red and white baseball caps and waving little red and gold flags of China interspersed with the red and white flags of the new Hong Kong SAR, the crowds marched through busy streets, laughing and urging bystanders to join in. Few did.
Not everyone was as joyful as those in the parade.
A handful of demonstrators, their mouths taped shut, took up position around the base of Victoria's statue and held up placards condemning China's military crackdown on student-led demonstrators around Beijing's Tiananmen Square in June, 1989.
""People are bleeding, butchers are celebrating, shame on you,"" the black and white placards read.
But they failed to get much attention.

119,"Royal/Dutch Shell's plan to build an oil refinery in China inched closer to reality on Monday when Chinese oil officials revealed Beijing was close to giving its long-awaited approval.
A senior Chinese oil official involved in the US$6 billion refinery and chemical complex plan told Reuters that Beijing was poised to give its stamp of approval before the end of 1996.
""From what I know, it will be approved very soon by the Chinese government,"" the official said by telephone in Beijing.
""It will probably be this year,"" said the official.
The petrochemical complex, planned for Huizhou, in southern China's booming Guangdong province, has been on the drawing board since the late 1980s. A feasibility study report was presented to Beijing in February 1994.
Shell plans to hold 50 percent in the complex and China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) 20 percent, while the Guangdong provincial government, China Merchants Holding Company and state refiner SINOPEC each would have 10 percent.
""The Chinese side and Shell have discussed this for several years. Both sides have spent a lot of effort, money,"" said the official, who declined to be named.
If successful, the Shell plant would be the second joint venture refinery in the country to involve foreign participation. The 100,000 barrel per day Dalian refinery in northern China began trial runs in October. France's Total holds 20 percent of that facility along with various Chinese partners.
Indications that fresh developments on the long-stalled project might soon emerge came in September when a top Shell official met Chinese Premier Li Peng to discuss the company's future cooperation with China.
The project figured highly on the agenda when John Jennings, chairman of Shell Transport and Trading Co, met the Chinese premier in Beijing, oil sources earlier disclosed.
""That clearly was a sign that both sides were positive about the project,"" said a Shell spokesman by telephone.
Beijing's positive stance was spurred by the overriding concern that the country needed to increase its oil production and refining capacity to meet rising oil demand, the Chinese oil official said.
China's oil consumption is forecast to explode in the next few years, fuelled by economic reforms.
Experts estimate refined oil product consumption would grow at an average yearly rate of 5.7 percent during 1995-2000, reaching 4.1 million bpd in 2000 and 5.3 million bpd by 2005.
To meet rising demand, China would need to import 40 to 50 million tonnes of crude oil by 2000 compared with 17.09 million tonnes in 1995, experts said.
The World Bank has said China would overtake the United States as the world's biggest economy within the next generation and foreign oil companies are keen to tap its domestic market by building new refineries.
Shell's project has faced countless hurdles since the early 1990s, from high costs to strained bilateral relations.
The project was kept on tenterhooks in early 1993, when Sino-British ties plunged to a low over Hong Kong after Governor Chris Patten introduced democratic reforms in the colony, which reverts to Chinese rule in mid-1997.
China's credit-tightening policy in 1994 and centralisation of the country's oil policy in the same year erected further hurdles for the costly joint venture project.
""This project was initially thought to be gunned down... because it was too costly. But now, they want to go ahead with it,"" a source with state refiner SINOPEC said by telephone.
At the same time Shell started a long-drawn-out fight for more access to the booming domestic market in China.
Some Chinese officials are known to be reluctant to giving foreign oil companies toeholds in the massive market while others preferred foreign investments be channeled into upgrades of older refineries.
A Shell spokesman in Hong Kong said the company was hopeful of a speedy decision from Beijing.
Details of the joint venture have still to be worked out and the petrochemical complex, which would take at least four to five years to complete, would be ready only after 2000, Chinese oil sources said.

132,"The future leader of Hong Kong said on Thursday he would discuss the legality and funding of the territory's controversial post-colonial assembly with China's legislators during his visit to Beijing this weekend.
""I will discuss with the National People's Congress (NPC) the legal status of the provisional legislature, and also find out more on the arrangements for its funding,"" Tung Chee-hwa told reporters after a public function.
The former shipping boss did not say whether he would ask the Chinese parliament to pass a law to endorse the existence of the provisional legislature, which was formed on December 21 in China's southern city of Shenzhen.
Tung had previously said he may ask the NPC to enact such legislation if the need arose.
Britain and the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong say China's installation of the provisional legislature is illegal under the 1984 United Nations-registered Joint Declaration, which sets out the framework for the colony's returns to China.
China, upset by Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's electoral reforms in the twilight of British rule, set up the legislature to reverse these reforms when it resumes sovereignty of the colony at midnight on June 30.
The interim chamber was chosen by a 400-strong Selection Committee, hand-picked by Beijing. The committee also selected Tung to succeed Patten.
Tung has said the provisional legislature would soon hold its first meeting. However it will meet in China, not Hong Kong, in order to avoid a legal challenge by the colony's Democratic Party. The territory's biggest pro-democracy group says it is constitutionally illegal to have two legislatures operating at the same time.
Tung said he would try to persuade the Democrats to accept the provisional body during a meeting with them next Thursday. ""The provisional legislature has the right to exist. I hope that everyone ... can accept it,"" he said.
The chief executive-designate also said he would hold talks with Chinese officials during his two-day visit to the Chinese capital, but would not be more specific.
Tung visited Beijing on December 17 for the first time after his selection as Chief Executive and was received by President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.

142,"European parliamentarians urged Hong Kong people on Tuesday to ""speak up and not shut up"" in the face of growing fears that China will roll back democratic freedoms when the territory reverts to China.
They also said they will recommend to the European Parliament to urge Britain to contest China's decision to replace the territory's elected legislature with an appointed interim chamber at the handover at midnight of June 30.
""Our message to Hong Kong is don't shut up, speak up,"" said Graham Watson, a member of the British Liberal Democratic Party, at a news conference during a two-day visit.
Citing a European maxim, Watson said, ""What is required for evil to triumph is for good people to remain silent"", adding that democracy was now the way of the world, while totalitarianism and dictatorship was evil.
Watson and three other members of the European Parliament (MEPs) met Hong Kong's future leader Tung Chee-hwa, prominent lawyers and members of Hong Kong's current elected legislature, and will meet colonial Governor Chris Patten.
Hong Kong, a British colony of over 150 years, reverts to China from July 1, and fears are mounting among its 6.4 million people that its democratic freedoms and rights, introduced by Britain in the final years of its rule, will be snuffed out.
Chief amongst Hong Kong's worries is a China-crafted provisional legislature which will replace the elected chamber, and Beijing's plan to amend or strike down a string of laws protecting civil liberties and democracy.
Tung, who replaces Patten on July 1, has backed the proposed changes, arguing that they were mere technicalities and necessary to preserve social order.
The MEPs, who criticised Britain for being too late in bringing democracy and civil rights to Hong Kong, also said London should contest the legality of the shadow legislature in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague.
""We believe the United Kingdom would have a good case...for going to the United Nations, even the Security Council and asking for the matter to be referred to the ICJ,"" Watson said.
""We believe that the abolition of the elected Legislative Council is an illegal act, and we believe it should be challenged in international law,"" he said.
London has said its hands are tied on the matter as China has refused to refer the issue to the world court. The MEPs however thought the matter should be pursued.
""There is nothing to stop the United Kingdom taking it to the United Nations...we would like to see the panoply of legal instruments in due process in law be used, even if in the end the process is frustrated,"" Watson said.
A dozen activists staged a noisy protest at the office of future leader Tung on Tuesday morning, demanding an apology for his support of China's plans.
The group, a coalition of 27 grassroot organisations which called itself the Hong Kong People's United Front for the Defence of Human Rights, chanted slogans and called on Tung to relate the views of Hong Kong people to Chinese leaders.
""We strongly request the future chief executive to apologise to all Hong Kong people and to honestly reflect their views to the Chinese government and to do his duty by defending human rights, freedom and the rule of law,"" the group said in a letter later given to Tung's office employees.

149,"Hong Kong's pro-Taiwan community flew Nationalist Chinese flags across the territory on Thursday to mark Taiwan's national day for what could be the last time before China takes over in mid-1997.
As champagne glasses clinked amidst the laughter of hundreds of guests, Taiwanese hosts and well-known artistes flown in for the grand event in the posh Regent Hotel fronting the Victoria Harbour, many wondered if they would be able to celebrate in the same style next year.
""We don't know about next year, we have to see how the future Hong Kong government decides,"" Zheng An Guo, general manager of the Chong Hua Travel Agency, Taipei's de facto mission in Hong Kong, told reporters.
Hong Kong, a British colony for over a century and a half, reverts to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997. Under its Basic Law, a mini-constitution which takes effect from the handover, is a clause that Hong Kong must observe the ""one-China"" principle.
Communist China regards Taiwan as a rebel province since the Nationalist government fled to the island after losing the Chinese civil war in 1949 and has long sought to push the island into diplomatic isolation.
""I'm not sure what the future is for the celebration of the Double-ten event next year but we really want to continue if we can, even (if it is) within some other format,"" said Zhang Su Hui, a Chong Hua spokeswoman.
She added the form of the event next year and the fate of future Hong Kong-Taiwan relations would have to be sorted out through high-level cross-straits negotiations.
Pro-Taiwan sources believe the post-handover authority is likely to prevent flashy celebrations of the event -- known as ""Double-ten"" because it falls on the 10th day of the 10th month -- and to bar public display of Taiwanese flags and gatherings.
While the continued existence of the de facto Taiwanese mission is less in doubt -- so long as it abides by rules -- the raising of the Taiwanese flag, representing clear skies, white sun and the earth flushed with redness of the warrior's blood, would probably not be allowed.
""This is very clear, and the principle is very clear... after 1997, Hong Kong must abide by the 'one China' principle as laid down in the Basic Law,"" said a spokesman with Xinhua, Beijing's de facto embassy in Hong Kong.
Asked if raising of the Taiwan flag after the handover would contravene the Basic Law, he said, ""It should be. After 97, this matter according to the Basic Law would be enforced by the Hong Kong government, the central (Beijing) government would not interfere in this matter.""

153,"Chrysler Corp. minivans have came under fire again from safety regulators, who said Tuesday they stepped up probes into two problems, including reports that a 90-pound rear hatch door can suddenly close without warning.
Nearly 2 million minivans are involved in the investigations, which were also sparked by reports that side sliding doors on 1996 models flew open at high speeds.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it has received reports that 39 people have been injured when the rear hatch door on 1991-1993 model Caravan, Voyager and Town &amp; Country minivans dropped unexpectedly.
The problem occurs when bolts holding cylinders that prop the door open shear, according to the federal safety agency. The agency has received a total of 477 complaints. The probe, first launched in May and upgraded on Oct. 31, covers almost 1.3 million minivans.
NHTSA also upgraded a preliminary investigation into about 582,000 1996-model Caravan, Voyager and Town &amp; Country minivans. It has received 19 complaints that the right or left sliding door can come open while the vehicle is moving.
Owners have reported doors opening a few inches or flying wide open at speeds from 15 to 60 mph. No injuries have been reported. NHTSA said it is not aware of any incidents involving vehicles built during or after January 1996.
Chrysler was the first automaker to offer a sliding door on the left side of a minivan. The feature has made the No. 3 automaker's minivans the hottest seller in a popular segment.
Chrysler agreed in 1995, under pressure from regulators, to replace the latches on the rear hatch doors on more than 4 million minivans but stopped short of recalling the vehicles, from the 1984 through 1995 model years. Safety officials said the doors could pop open during low-speed crashes.
A Chrysler official could not be reached to comment.
But the company has told the safety agency the sliding door problem may stem from incorrect latch adjustments by dealers, which the company attributed to problems with the service manual.
Chrysler also said eight of the complaints about side doors opening involved vehicles that had had door repairs made. Chrysler said it has corrected the manual procedure and has made three design changes to door components.
But NHTSA said it has continued to receive complaints about the doors opening on vehicles with no repair history.
Separately, NHTSA said it upgraded an investigation into 621,000 1995 and 1996 Windstar minivans from Ford Motor Co. Regulators have received 327 complaints about brake problems, which have led to 76 accidents and two injuries.
In addition to the incidents reported to NHTSA, Ford said it has received 64,000 warranty claims that could relate to a brake problem causing long stopping distances.
Also, NHTSA said it opened an investigation into Land Rover's Discovery sport/utility vehicle. It has received two complaints that the right front door opened on 1996 models. Rover is a unit of German carmaker BMW.
Chrysler stock fell 25 cents to $34.75 on the New York Stock exchange in afternoon trading.

164,"General Motors Corp. told employees it has a potential buyer for four of its parts plants, but denied reports Tuesday that it is in discussions to sell the facilities to Canadian auto supplier Magna International Inc.
GM informed workers at its Delphi Interior and Lighting Systems plant in Flint, Mich., on Monday that it has a possible buyer for the facility and three others, union and company representatives said Tuesday.
The 1,200 workers at the Flint plant were not told who the prospective buyer is, said officials at United Auto Workers union Local 326.
""They did tell us that as we spoke the potential buyer was entering into discussions,"" said Tim Thompson, a district shop committee officer for Local 326.
The Detroit News reported Tuesday that GM is talking with Magna, of Markham, Ontario, and that a deal could be announced soon. Separately, a source with knowledge of the auto supplier industry told Reuters that Atoma International Inc., a division of Magna, won the bidding for the plants, although the deal had not been finalized.
But Delphi spokeswoman Kari Hulsey denied that Magna is a finalist to buy the plants. ""It's not Magna, it's not a division of Magna,"" she said.""
One factor that could delay the announcement is the continuing contract talks between the UAW in the United States and Canada and Detroit's Big Three automakers. If Magna does turn out to be the buyer, it may be to GM's advantage to hold off finalizing a deal. Magna has previously had a contentious relationship with the Canadian United Auto Workers union.
The buyer wants to purchase the Flint plant, one in Livonia, Mich., and two in Canada as a group. The plants employ a total of 5,100 hourly workers and make a variety of interior parts, including hinges, door panels and instrument panels, GM said.
The Flint plant, which makes hardware, and the Livonia facility, which makes interior door panels, are both Delphi plants. The fabricating facility in Oshawa, Ontario, and a seat plant in Windsor, Ontario, are managed by GM of Canada but make products for Delphi.
GM spokeswoman Hulsey would not say if the four facilities are among the 14 underperforming Delphi plants that GM has said it wants to divest.

168,"Chrysler Corp. Tuesday reported brisk sales of minivans and pickup trucks for August, pushing total U.S. sales for the automaker up 9 percent on a daily selling basis to 186,306.
The August total broke a company record for the month of 176,184 set in 1989.
Sales of light trucks, including popular Ram pickups and four-door minivans were 127,870, a 16.7 percent jump that marked the 11th consecutive month of rising light truck sales.
Domestically produced car sales came in weaker than some analysts had expected, falling 2 percent to 58,255 units.
Chrysler's strong light truck sales were helped by incentives on some Jeep sport utility models. Grand Cherokee sales rose 42 percent; Cherokee was up 52 percent; and Wrangler sales shot up 59 percent.
Total pickup sales were held back somewhat by low supplies of the Dakota, which is undergoing a model changeover. Dealers have a 35-day supply of the compact pickups -- about half of what the industry considers to be ideal.
Chrysler executives said they did not expect significant volumes of the new Dakotas to be available until October.
Steven Torok, executive director of sales and marketing operations, said Chrysler was not concerned about the slide in car sales. Total car sales were down 4 percent from August 1995, and off 24 percent from July.
August is often a seasonally weaker month than July, Torok said. Also, declines in the Dodge Stratus and Neon were partly attributable to model-year changeovers.
""Frankly, we saw our cars starting to firm up as the month went on, and we think we'll have a pretty good month in September,"" said Torok, adding September car sales will likely surpass those of August.
Torok said the No. 3 automaker was pleased with the breadth of its sales performance.
""What we see is a very even, consistent demand pattern,"" he said. ""Consumer sentiment seems to be not euphoric but consistent.""
Although car sales were slightly weaker, PaineWebber analyst Michael Ward said Chrysler's total numbers were still respectable because it was up against a strong year-ago performance.
Chrysler was the only one of the major automakers to report monthly sales on Tuesday. General Motors Corp. is scheduled to repoort sales Wednesday. Ward predicted it will post sales that are 4 percent to 5 percent below last year, with light trucks again offsetting weak car numbers.
Also on Tuesday, Subaru of America, a unit of Fuji Heavy Industries, reported U.S. sales up 18 percent to 10,361. Volvo Cars of North America, a unit of AB Volvo had August sales of 7,349, down almost 1 percent.

174,"General Motors Corp, still feeling the effects of a 20-day Canadian autoworker strike, told all of its 5,000 Lordstown, Ohio, assembly workers they will be idled for two weeks, company and United Auto Workers officials said Thursday.
The plant, which makes the Chevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac Sunfire small cars, has run out of transmissions supplied by a GM parts plant in Windsor, Ontario.
Workers at another assembly plant, the Buick City complex in Flint, Mich., could also be idled on Friday or early next week, industry sources said. The plant, which employs 5,236 hourly UAW workers, makes LeSabre, Park Avenue, Eighty Eight and Bonneville, mid-sized cars.
""It's a situation we are looking at,"" said GM spokesman Tom Klipstine, adding the automaker continues to monitor all of its vehicle and parts production operations.
As of Thursday afternoon GM had told 23,801 assembly and parts workers in the United States and Mexico to stay home because of a shortage of parts from its Canadian operations.
The Lordstown shutdown is the second U.S. plant where GM has suspended operations completely since 26,000 Canadian Auto Workers began an escalating strike on Oct. 3. The first plant to go totally down was Detroit/Hamtramck, which makes Cadillacs.
The Lordstown plant has three crews. The first crew was told to report back Nov. 10, the second Nov. 11 and the third Nov. 12, a UAW spokeswoman said.
Losing production of the mid-sized cars is not expected to have a big impact on sales, because the automaker had between 67 and 98 days supply of those vehicles on dealer lots as of the end of September, according to Autodata Corp.
But GM could feel the impact of lost production of its popular Cavalier and Sunfire cars. The Cavalier had a 61 days supply and the Sunfire had 61. The industry generally considers 60-days supply to be ideal.
GM and CAW negotiators reached agreement on a new three-year labor pact Oct. 22. The deal was approved by CAW members Wednesday.
The Canadian operations are being brought up in stages.

176,"The effects of a strike by 26,000 Canadian autoworkers will continue to ripple through General Motors Corp.'s operations even though a tentative deal was reached Tuesday after marathon talks.
GM has told about 2,000 workers at its Lordstown, Ohio, car assembly plant not to report to work when their work week begins on Friday, said company spokesman Tom Klipstine.
""There are still some problems out there in terms of having enough material to keep plants running,"" he said.
Negotiators for the company and the Canadian Auto Workers union settled disputes over the contracting out of work and reached a tentative agreement on a new contract, putting an end to the 19-day strike.
In addition to the striking CAW members, GM has idled 19,931 workers at dozens of assembly and parts plants in the U.S. and Mexico that depend on the Canadian operations. That figure does not include workers such as the Lordstown employees whose scheduled shifts have yet to start.
If the deal is ratified Wednesday as expected and parts resume shipments, Klipstine said it could take until the end of next week before all of GM's affected plants are operating at pre-strike levels.
One analyst estimated the strike could end up costing the world's largest automaker about 100,000 units of straight-time production in North America.
The calculation, by CSM Forecasting in Farmington Hills, Mich., assumes that all of GM's plants are back in operation by Oct. 28, and does not include over-time production.
""There's still some operations that may go down that we may have not anticipated,"" said Michael Robinet, managing director of CSM, an industry consulting firm. ""There's going to be some ebb and flow.""
GM is expected to lose production of about 51,000 units in Canada, and 45,000 to 46,000 units in the United States, Robinet said.
Of the 51,000 units in Canada, about 40 percent are GM's popular full-size C/K pickup trucks, which are made at GM's assembly complex in Oshawa, Ontario, he said.
CAW President Buzz Hargrove told reporters during a press conference after the new pact was reached that GM could restart the Oshawa truck plant as soon as Wednesday night, after the deal is ratified.
Inventories of the trucks have been tight, and the sales effects will start showing up in the October sales numbers, analysts said.
Any market share losses to competitors, however, would be tempered by the fact that Ford Motor Co. is already running at maximum capacity for its new F-Series pickups, said David Healy, an analyst at Burnham Securities Inc.
GM had sufficient inventories of cars that the strike is not expected to crimp those sales too much, analysts said.
Where GM could be hurt most is in new product launches. Production of the new Buick Century was previously scheduled to start at the Oshawa car plant on Nov. 4. But the strike could push that back until the middle or end of November, Robinet said.
GM's Oklahoma City, Okla., assembly plant will also be delayed another two to three weeks in starting production of the new Oldsmobile Cutlass and Chevrolet Malibu cars, because of a parts shortage due to the strike, he said.
Healy, who believes GM has lost production of about 65,000 units, estimated it will bring down the automaker's earnings by about $225 million after taxes. A strike at two Dayton, Ohio, brake plants in March cost GM $900 million.
""It's not a major disaster,"" Healy said. ""It's not of the magnitude of Dayton.""

178,"Ford Motor Co. on Friday became the second of the U.S. Big Three automakers to align itself with the emerging auto superstore trend by announcing a new agreement with Republic Industries Inc., the parent company of AutoNation USA.
Under the agreement, AutoNation can submit proposals to acquire existing Ford or Lincoln-Mercury dealerships. The pact also covers areas Ford may want a dealership where it does not currently have one.
The move could have implications for the future of Ohio-based Mullinax Management, one of the largest dealer groups in the country, which is reported to be in merger talks with AutoNation.
Ford spokesman John Ochs said Ford has not sold any dealerships to AutoNation. A spokesman for Mullinax, based in Amherst, Ohio, could not be reached for comment.
Mullinax, which owns several large Ford dealerships, was the 11th largest dealer group in the country, based on its 1995 retail unit sales of 20,374 cars and trucks, according to industry trade publication Automotive News.
Last month, published reports began to surface on talks between Mullinax and AutoNation. The growing auto superstore chain was founded by Wayne Huizenga, who transformed Blockbuster Video into a multibillion-dollar business and owns the Miami Dolphins professional football team.
Ford's deal with Republic is a ""framework agreement"" that opens the door for AutoNation to submit individual proposals, Ochs said. In a statement, Robert Rewey, Ford's group vice president of marketing and sales, said the automaker believed private entrepreneurs with local community ties will continue to be the ""backbone"" of its franchise system.
""However, there will continue to be developments in the industry relating to other types of dealership ownership and distribution methods,"" he said. ""We are working diligently to ensure that the new operators fit into our franchise system.""
That is a change from last February, when Ford Chairman Alex Trotman told the National Automotible Dealers Association it had no plans to offer a new-car franchise to an auto superstore.
A year ago, Chrysler Corp. announced it would grant a new-car franchise to CarMax Auto Superstore in Norcross, Ga. CarMax is owned by consumer electronics giant Circuit City Stores Inc..
The move sent a shockwave through the traditional auto dealer industry, which had already been warily watching the growth of chains such as CarMax and AutoNation in the used-car segment of the business.
The new superstores quickly have become popular with consumers because they offer large numbers of newer used cars at haggle-free prices in a pressure-free environment.
The Ford announcement signals the superstores will continue to build a presence in the new-car business, analysts said. ""That's big news,"" said William Sawyer, vice president of sales in the Detroit office of Polk, a marketing research firm. ""It's definitely a change for Ford.""
The move is also noteworthy, he said, because Ford has traditionally been opposed to publicly traded companies owning its franchises.
General Motors Corp. is the last of the Big Three to not have any franchise agreements with an auto superstore. GM spokesman Edward Lechtzin said the automaker was not opposed to the concept and has held talks with those groups in the past.
""We've held discussions. We'll continue to hold discussions. If one of them wants to purchase a GM dealership, we'll review it,"" he said.

184,"Labour lawyer James Hoffa, refusing to concede defeat in the Teamsters union presidential election nearly a week after his opponent claimed victory, called Thursday for a congressional investigation into the vote.
Hoffa on Tuesday formally asked U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno to impound the ballots and initiate an FBI investigation into ""serious irregularities"" in the election.
""We really have what I call Teamstergate,"" Hoffa told reporters at a news conference Thursday at the Teamsters' Detroit offices, where his legendary father, the late Jimmy Hoffa, ruled the union in the 1950s and '60s.
Incumbent Teamsters President Ron Carey on Saturday claimed victory in the hard-fought election, winning by an apparent margin of about 17,000 votes. But 41,002 ballots were set aside for further eligibility checks, and Hoffa says more than 25,000 other ballots may have disappeared.
After all eligible votes were tallied late Saturday, court-appointed Election Officer Barbara Zack Quindel accounted for 485,605 ballots returned. But last week she reported that the total number of mail-in ballots received was 511,268, an estimate based on receipts from the U.S. Postal Service.
Hoffa said he wants an explanation for the discrepancy between the ballots counted and the ballots received.
""If I lost, I lost. I just want a fair election,"" Hoffa said.
Carey, 60, was first elected president of the 1.4 million-member International Brotherhood of Teamsters as a reformer in 1991. His apparent re-election was lauded by AFL-CIO President John Sweeney, who had remained neutral during the campaign.
Meanwhile, Quindel decided Wednesday to void 120 Hoffa votes after finding that a Hoffa backer and former officer of Teamsters Local 743 in Chicago violated election rules by collecting and mailing ballots for other members, according to her spokesman, Jeff O'Mara.
Acting on a protest filed by Carey's campaign last week, O'Mara said Quindel decided it would be too extreme a remedy to void all of the local's ballots, estimated by the Carey campaign at more than 2,800.
The ballots were among 41,002 so-called challenged ballots that are still being checked for eligibility and have yet to be counted. Although there are enough of them to erase Carey's lead, Hoffa would need to carry the challenged ballots by a better than three-to-one margin for that to happen.
The election officer has not disclosed any interim results of the tabulation of the challenge ballots. O'Mara said he did not know when the tabulation would be completed.
Hoffa said Thursday, however, that initial tabulations of the challenged ballots have cut Carey's lead by as much as 2,400 votes. He did not disclose how many votes had been counted.

188,"While General Motors Corp. struggles to overcome labor costs of $43 an hour at its parts plants, the head of one global auto supplier is painting a Darwinian view of the future, in which an increasing number of workers earn less than $10 an hour.
Nearly one-quarter of ITT Automotive Inc.'s workers around the world will be paid a combined hourly wage and benefit rate of less than $10 by 2000, the company's top executive said this week at a conference of suppliers.
That sobering forecast spotlights a long-term problem for GM, which is now in the throes of negotiating a new three-year labor contract with the United Auto Workers union.
""They can't make a buck stamping out taillights and paying people $43 an hour,"" said David Healy, an analyst at Burnham Securities Inc.
Adds Lehman Brothers analyst Joseph Phillippi: ""Their 43 other competitors aren't going to say 'We'll spot you a couple of years.'""
Timothy Leuliette, president and chief executive officer of ITT Automotive, said the company paid 15 percent of its 35,000 workers around the world less than $10 an hour in 1995. That was up from 10 percent of its employees at that pay level in 1990.
""Do we do that because we're mean?"" Leuliette said of the falling wage rates. ""No. We did that because we have to promise our customers a 3 to 4 percent price reduction.""
Facing union demands for greater job security, GM must find a way for its massive Delphi Automotive Systems parts business to stay competitive in the worldwide auto supplier market.
In the current talks, Delphi has said 12 of its U.S. component facilities are underperforming and should not be subject to the job guarantees the UAW has received from other automakers.
Even if it accepts the economic terms already agreed to by Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. , GM and Delphi will pay the average U.S. parts worker a base wage of nearly $19 an hour in the first year of the contract, and more than $21 in 1999, the third year of the agreement.
About 42 percent of Delphi's workers are located in the United States, where the combined hourly wage and benefit cost of a UAW worker under the 1993 national agreement is about $43.
Delphi, with 1995 revenues of $26.4 billion, is in 167 businesses around the world. Global expansion remains a focus for the company, which this year expects 35 percent of its revenues to come from customers outside of GM's North American Operations, Delphi President J.T. Battenberg said Tuesday.
But as Leuliette's comments indicate, the global auto supplier industry is growing increasingly competitive.
The worldwide hourly wage rate for assembling a labor-intensive part such as a wire harness is between $1 and $2, he estimated. More technical parts cost $10-$12 an hour. Leuliette said workers in Vietnam will earn $64 a month working 48 hours a week putting together wiring harnesses for ITT.
""If you are regionally competitive but not globally competitive, you will unlikely be a supplier to ITT,"" Leuliette told the gathering of suppliers in Detroit.
ITT Automotive, based in Auburn Hills, Mich., is the biggest unit within ITT Industries Inc., and one of the largest independent auto suppliers in the world.
The company, which has annual sales of about $5.5 billion, makes brake and chassis systems, as well as body and electrical components such as motors, actuators and wiper systems. Leuliette estimated the company's average global total wage costs at about $14 an hour.

191,"New pickup trucks and sport/utility vehicles helped Ford Motor Co.'s third-quarter profits nearly double to $686 million, the company said Wednesday, but it alarmed analysts with growing losses in Europe.
Ford eeked out a $15 million profit from its worldwide automotive operations -- versus a loss of $201 million a year ago --  as U.S. automotove net income of $634 million was offset by a loss of $619 million from non-U.S. regions.
Ford's third-quarter profits, which amounted to 56 cents a share on a fully diluted basis, compared with $357 million, or 27 cents a share, in the year-ago period. The latest results were in line with Wall Street expectations.
Boosting the numbers was another strong performance from Ford's Financial Services Group. The unit earned $671 million, including a gain of $76 million from the sale of USL Capital assets, compared with a profit of $558 million in the 1995 third quarter.
But Ford Credit's earnings slipped to $299 million from $357 million a year ago, reflecting higher credit losses.
""I think there's some real red flags there with overseas operations and Ford Credit,"" said Bear Stearns analyst Nicholas Lobocarro.
The company's earnings were negatively affected by a $39 million charge to cover the costs of early retirements for U.S. salaried employees. Ford expects to report further charges of $300 million to $400 million in the fourth quarter for more early retirements.
Despite the charges, Ford Chairman Alex Trotman said the company expects its automotive results to be stronger in the fourth quarter from a year ago, with higher sales volumes and improving margins.
In the U.S. market, the latest results were spurred by strong acceptance of new light truck products such as the F-Series pickup truck and new Expedition full-size sport/utility vehicle, Trotman said.
""Outside the U.S., results continue to reflect challenges in several key regions, particularly Europe and South America,"" Trotman said in a statement, adding, ""There's still much to do.""
Ford lost $226 million from its South American operations in the third quarter, mostly from Brazil, up from a loss of $102 million in the year-ago period. Ford had said in September that second-half losses in South America would be larger than the first half because of a lower market share and a costly launch process for its new Fiesta.
In Europe, the company's loss grew to $472 million from $320 million. Ford blamed new product launches, adverse vehicle mixes and continued high marketing costs.
However, Ford said its European high-volume vehicle launches were largely completed and that it would focus on cost reductions. It added that new products, such as the recently launched Ka small car that will go on sale next month, will strengthen its European line-up.
Third-quarter revenues climbed to $34 billion from $31.4 billion. Worldwide vehicle unit sales in the third quarter were also up, increasing to 1,452,000 from 1,435,000.
But the automaker lost market share in both the U.S. and western Europe. Ford ended the quarter with 24.5 percent of the U.S. car and truck market. It had 24.8 percent in both the second quarter of 1996 and the third quarter of 1995.
Ford lost a full point of share in western Europe, falling to 11.8 percent from 12.8 percent in the year-ago quarter. Ford's share in the second quarter was 12.0 percent.
The Associates, Ford's consumer finance unit, reported third-quarter earnings of $230 million, a record for any quarter.
Trotman said Ford expects U.S. total vehicle sales to be 15.5 million for 1996, about in line with its earlier forecasts. The industry had 15.1 million sales in 1995.
In Western Europe, Ford forecasts industry sales at 14.2 million for 1996, up from 13.4 million in 1995. Ford expects moderate economic growth to continue in its major worldwide markets, providing for stable industry sales volumes.

196,"General Motors Corp, battling to avoid a second strike by assembly and parts workers this month, said it was hopeful a new labor contract could be reached before an extension deadline at midnight on Sunday.
Speaking to reporters gathered at GM's headquarters here, GM spokesman Chuck Licari said GM and the United Auto Workers were still working to resolve difficult and complex issues.
""GM remains hopeful an agreement can be reached before the UAW's termination of the current 1993 national agreement at 11:59 p.m. (0459 GMT) tonight,"" said Licari.
At stake is a new labor agreement for GM's 215,000 hourly UAW workers. GM employs more than half of the approximately 390,000 UAW members who work at Detroit's Big Three automakers. It is the only one of the Big Three to not have a new three-year labor contract.
UAW spokesman Frank Joyce declined to comment on the talks. UAW President Stephen Yokich said on Friday that he was not optimistic a deal could be reached by the deadline. In a sign an agreement might not be reached tonight, Licari said GM Chairman Jack Smith was not at the automaker's headquarters, although he was in touch with negotiators.
Both Ford Motor Co Chairman Alex Trotman and Chrysler Corp Chairman Robert Eaton were present for the final stages of their company's negotiations and appeared at press conferences announcing a deal.
Bargainers for UAW and GM resumed Sunday morning after they adjourned Saturday evening. Analysts speculated that negotiators could be wrangling over contract language that would dictate how many workers GM would have to guarantee jobs.
Bowing to UAW concerns over job security, both Ford and Chrysler have agreed to new contracts that promise to keep 95 percent of their current UAW hourly workforces except in the event of a severe industry downturn.
""I think if there's a sticking point that may be it,"" said Dale Brickner, a labor expert at the Michigan State University. ""GM may be pushing to get that figure farther down than the UAW may be comfortable living with.""
GM, the least efficient U.S. automaker, is trying to shed 12 unprofitable parts plants, and wants to exclude certain component facilities from the employment guarantee, including a door hardware plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich.
In settling a 20-day strike by the Canadian Auto Workers union last week, GM was able to secure a deal that included the sale of two parts plants and flexibility to outsource more products.
Yokich has not said what he will do after once the contract extension expires at midnight Sunday. He set the deadline on Friday, but did not actually threaten a strike. Workers have been told to stay on the job until they hear otherwise.
However, there was speculation Sunday the UAW could mount a plant-specific strike if not enough progress had been made by the deadline. By hitting light truck plants such as the sport/utility facility in Janesville, Wis., the union could hurt the sale of some of GM's most profitable products at a time it is trying to bounce back from the Canadian strike.
GM's U.S. operations continue to respond to the strike by 26,000 CAW workers. The more than 6,600 UAW members at GM's Buick City complex have been told not to report Monday. At the same time, GM is running radio ads telling first-shift workers at its Hamtramck assembly plant to report to work Monday.

204,"Microsoft Corp stock is ending 1996 near where it began -- at slightly more than $80 a share.
But after adjusting for a stock split, the value of those shares is up a stunning 91 percent, and company chairman Bill Gates, the richest man in America, has seen his stake rise to about $23.6 billion from $12.4 billion.
While analysts are not predicting Microsoft will repeat that performance in 1997, the computer software giant carries a lot of momentum into the new year.
The company will start the year by launching the latest version of Office -- its biggest revenue producer -- and plans to flesh out its package of computer network software for the red-hot Internet market.
A new Internet browser due by midyear will change the look of the computer desktop, and upgrades to both of Microsoft's core Windows operating systems could be out by the end of the year.
Microsoft's high-end Windows NT system, which failed to catch on when it was launched in 1993, now forms the core of a business that could account for 25 percent of the company's estimated $10.6 billion in revenues in the current fiscal year ending June 30.
""The fundamentals are strong and getting stronger,"" said David Readerman, an analyst with brokerage Montgomery Securities.
On average, analysts expect Microsoft's earnings to rise about 20 percent to $2.06 a share in the current fiscal year from $1.71 last year and then another 20 percent in fiscal 1998 to $2.48 a share, according to the First Call service.
While that falls well short of last year's 51 percent earnings gain, it still represents a hefty increase for a $10 billion company, and Microsoft has a way of pleasantly surprising Wall Street with its earnings growth every quarter.
Analysts say Microsoft shows no signs of growing complacent despite holding a market share of 80 percent or more in its main businesses of personal computer operating systems and productivity applications.
In the past year alone the company virtually has tried to reinvent itself to focus on the rapidly growing Internet marketplace and beat back rivals led by Netscape Communications Corp.
""They've done a fabulous job. They've changed themselves from a company that was threatened by the Internet to one whose future is dependent on the Internet,"" said analyst Scott Winkler of the Gartner Group, a research and consulting company.
Virtually all Microsoft's upcoming products have strong Internet tie-ins: from the Office 97 upgrade, which makes word-processing and spreadsheet applications more compatible with Internet protocols, to server, or computer network, software in its BackOffice line that helps companies do business over the Internet.
Microsoft is spending some $500 million this year on media-related projects, including its relaunched Microsoft Network online service and MSNBC joint news venture with NBC.
While some of the projects could lose money for years to come, analysts say the media efforts represent a classic example of Gates' fondness for making big bets -- in this case, for a chance at a piece of online transaction fees that ultimately could be huge.
""If they are successful in pursuing their vision, this will be their core business five years from now,"" said Scott McAdams, analyst with brokerage Ragen MacKenzie.
""It's analogous to the early work they did with Windows itself,"" he said. ""You start small and you keep chipping away.""

207,"Microsoft Corp. is expected to report modest earnings growth for the latest quarter Friday despite tough comparisons with the year-earlier period and a sales slowdown ahead of an upgrade of a popular software package.
Industry analysts surveyed by First Call on average expect Microsoft to report earnings of 51 cents a share for its second quarter ended on Dec. 31, up about 16 percent from the 44 cents a share reported a year earlier. Sales are expected to rise about 14 percent to more than $2.5 billion.
Analysts consider that a strong performance against tough comparisons with the year-earlier period, the first full quarter of availability for the Windows 95 operating system.
In the 1995 second quarter sales soared 54 percent and net income jumped 48 percent.
""These guys are just incredibly strong now,"" said Rob Owens of Pacific Crest Securities in Portland, Ore. ""They'll probably meet or beat (Wall) Street's estimate again.""
Investors will have all weekend to analyse the results, which are due to be released after the close of trading Friday.
Microsoft executives originally had scheduled the release for Thursday but decided to delay the report until a day after an event publicising the launch of Office 97, its best-selling package of business software.
Analysts estimated that revenues of Office and its component applications account for up to 30 percent of Microsoft's total, but the figure will be lower for the quarter just ended because of the impending upgrade.
For much of the quarter Microsoft offered Office 95 buyers coupons good for a free upgrade, which will result in some revenues being deferred into future reporting periods.
But strong growth in personal computer sales and in acceptance of Microsoft's high-end Windows NT operating system continue to buoy the company's profits.
""The ongoing strength of the NT cycle is what's carrying the day,"" said Chris Galvin of Hambrecht &amp; Quist. ""Countervailing that is the tough comparison last year with the Windows 95 release, so it's a mixed scenario.""
Owen said that while sales of PCs to consumers were sluggish in the latest quarter, declining prices and increased processing power had sparked a new wave of corporate buying.
He said 30 percent or fewer of corporate desktops have made the transition to the Windows 95 or Windows NT systems.
""That's a tremendous opportunity for Microsoft,"" he said.

215,"Microsoft Corp. Friday reported better-than-expected second-quarter profits on broad strength in sales of its personal computer software but warned of slower earnings growth next year.
The Redmond, Wash.-based software giant posted earnings of $741 million or 57 cents a share in the second quarter of fiscal 1997, a 29 percent increase over the $575 million, or 45 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenues rose 22 percent to $2.68 billion from $2.2 billion a year earlier.
The results, issued after the market had closed, beat analysts' highest forecasts, sending shares of Microsoft as high as $89 in after-hours trading, but the stock later fell to $85.50 due to the warning about slower earnings growth. In regular Nasdaq trading, Microsoft had gained $1.125 to $87.125.
""It was a terrific quarter,"" said Goldman Sachs analyst Rick Sherlund. ""Compared with expectations, revenue was quite a bit stronger than expected, as was the earnings number.""
Wall Street analysts on average had expected Microsoft to report earnings of 51 cents a share, with estimates ranging from 47 to 55 cents, according to First Call.
Microsoft's earnings in the quarter were driven by strong sales in virtually all areas, including its Windows computer operating systems, BackOffice server software and desktop applications such as Office, executives said.
Revenues from ""OEM"" sales through computer manufacturers rose 29 percent to $866 million, while revenues from countries outside the United States, Canada and Europe rose 32 percent to $424 million, with Japan a particularly strong performer.
But in the earnings statement and in a conference call later with reporters and analysts, Microsoft chief financial officer Mike Brown warned that the company's growth is likely to slow in fiscal 1998, which begins July 1.
""We are pleased with the current financial results and growth prospects for the next two quarters, particularly with the outlook for sales of Office 97,"" Brown said in the statement.
""However I do anticipate slower earnings growth in fiscal 1998 (beginning July 1997) due to lower revenue increases in our maturing businesses and margin pressure from continuing aggressive spending on research and development and new business ventures,"" Brown said.
In the conference call he went so far as to wonder aloud about Microsoft's high stock price compared with its anticipated earnings growth.
""It's not my purpose to second-guess the market,"" he said. ""However I will say that our current EPS (earnings per share) multiple is cause for curiosty at least to me.""
Sherlund said such cautionary comments were typical of the company's financially conservative nature.
""Directionally those comments were quite consistent with what we've heard before,"" Sherlund said.
Scott McAdams, an analyst at Ragen MacKenzie, said that while Microsoft's price-earnings multiple is higher than would be expected given its slowing growth, investors pay a premium for its ability to consistently beat earnings estimates.
In a sign of Microsoft's financial strength, the software giant said it ended the quarter with $9.16 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from $7.1 billion just three months earlier.
And the company's ""unearned revenues,"" representing sales deferred to reflect costs incurred over the life of cyclical products such as Windows 95 and Office, rose to $1.013 billion from $651 million at the end of the previous quarter.

216,"Underdog Boeing Co., pitted against the nation's top two defence contractors, hopes to emerge as one of the winners next week when the Pentagon narrows the field to two competitors for the biggest weapons project of the early 21st century.
Boeing, Lockheed Martin Corp. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. are each leading teams bidding on a Pentagon contract to build 3,000 new joint strike fighters -- a deal that could be worth more than $170 billion over the next two decades.
Defence officials will announce on Nov. 18 the results of a hotly contested ""down select"" that will eliminate one of the three teams and leave the remaining bidders to build prototypes for a ""flyoff"" and final decision in fiscal year 2001.
""We have identified the joint strike fighter as our No. 1 new business opportunity,"" said Lee Whitney, a spokesman for Lockheed Martin, the nation's biggest defence contractor. ""We have focused resources from throughout the corporation on our configuration and all the effort necessary to emerge as the winner.""
The contract also is regarded as crucial for No. 2 McDonnell Douglas Corp., which recently announced its intention to reduce its commercial aviation efforts.
""Winning is more critical to Lockheed and McDonnell than it is to Boeing,"" said analyst Paul Nisbet of JSA Research.
But, he said, Boeing's entry was aggressive, promising up to 95 percent commonality among the three versions of the jet and a ""flyaway"" cost averaging less than $30 million for each plane, excluding billions in research and development.
""I think they're still viewed as being the dark horse, but if I really had to bet some money, I'd bet that Lockheed Martin is going to be the loser,"" Nisbet said. ""They already have two-thirds of the F-22, and the other two proposals are at least as good or even better.""
The joint strike fighter is aimed at cutting costs by serving the needs of the Air Force, Marines, Navy and the British Royal Navy with a single common airframe.
Some within the Pentagon chafe at the concept of a multi-purpose jet design with three versions -- including advanced air-to-ground strike capability for the Air Force and vertical ""hover"" landing capability for the Marines.
But the project appears to have the momentum to carry it forward into the 21st century, when it would replace four existing fighters after delivery begins in fiscal 2008.
In addition to the 3,000 jets being ordered by the four services -- including more than 2,000 for the Air Force -- industry executives believe another 1,000 could be sold for export to U.S. allies.
While Boeing has major roles in current projects, including the B-2 bomber and F-22 fighter, the Seattle-based company, best known for its commercial airliners, has not been the prime contractor on a tactical military jet since the Army's P-26 ""Peashooter"" of the 1930s.
But analysts say the company's innovative design for the joint strike fighter, which includes one engine type and one wing for all three versions, may well earn it a place among the two finalists.
""Boeing's design became much more credibly viewed because they're leveraging their derivative technologies that they've built up over years of commercial production,"" said Nick Heymann, an analyst at Natwest Securities.
Boeing has signalled its intention to remain a major player in the military arena with its planned purchase of Rockwell International Corp. 's defence and space properties for $3.2 billion.
""We've come forward with a very innovative solution,"" Boeing defence and space President Jerry King said. ""The Pentagon is almost obligated to give us an opportunity to demonstrate that we can in fact deliver what we've committed to.""

217,"A bankruptcy judge Monday cleared the way for Montana construction mogul Dennis Washington to take over storied engineering giant Morrison Knudsen Corp., rescuing the company from near-insolvency.
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Peter Walsh, in Wilmington, Dela., approved the prepackaged reorganization plan under which Washington's main operating company will acquire the much-larger Morrison Knudsen for about $283 million in cash, stock and debt assumption.
Washington, 61, a billionaire through his interests in bridge and highway building, copper mining and shipping, will become non-executive chairman of the Boise, Idaho-based company when its merger with Washington Construction Group Inc. becomes effective Sept. 11.
Robert Tinstman, a company veteran appointed to be president and chief executive officer last year after the ouster of its high-flying former chairman, William Agee, will retain those titles in the new company.
The merger requires approval of Washington Construction Group shareholders, but that is a formality because Washington owns 68.5 percent of the shares.
The merged company will retain the Morrison Knudsen name and its Boise heaquarters, but shareholders of the old company -- known for such projects as the Hoover Dam and Alaskan oil pipeline -- will be left with little value.
A distribution of stock in the new company was valued by one analyst at about 15 cents a share, compared with nearly $30 before revelations of losses that stunned Wall Street and led to the ouster of Agee, whose lavish lifestyle had made him a lightning-rod for criticism.
""From a shareholder's point of view it's a pretty bad outcome,"" said the analyst, John Rogers of Jensen Securities.
Shareholders also get warrants to purchase additional shares in the new company at $12 a share, compared with Washington Construction's current price of $9.25. Bondholders will get from 93 to 95 percent of the $365 million they were owed, one banker said.
Executives say the new company will be profitable from the outset, with revenues estimated at $1.59 billion and net income at $31 million for its first full fiscal year beginning Dec. 1, according to bankruptcy court documents.
That compares with revenue of $2.72 billion and net income of $36 million in 1993, before the company reported losses that totalled more than $600 million over two years.
Analysts traced Morrison Knudsen's woes to a disastrous forway into railroads, including huge losses on bids to build new commuter transit cars, a business the company has exited.
Agee's ambitious plan to build new locomotives from the ground up never materialised, and its minority stake in MK Rail Corp. is being distributed to bondholders.
Agee himself, who once used a corporate jet to shuttle between Boise and his company-bought estate in Pebble Beach, Calif., was forced to give up some of his lucrative pension and severance benefits in a $63 million company settlement of class-action shareholder lawsuits.
The new Morrison will get about 90 percent of its revenues from three businesses -- industrial construction for Fortune 100 companies, heavy civil construction, and environmental remediation, mainly for government agencies, Tinstman said in an interview.
""Dennis very much wants this to be a well-balanced, diversified company,"" Tinstman said.
The remaining 10 percent of the company's business is mining.
Washington, who usually stays behind the scenes at his companies, will help set strategy at the new Morrison Knudsen but will not have a day-to-day role, Tinstman said.
Morrison Knudsen Chairman Robert Miller, who was brought in last year and is best known for helping to engineer Chrysler Corp.'s turnaround in the 1980s, will be vice chairman of the new company. The other vice chairman will be Washington aide Dorn Parkinson.

220,"Boeing Co. took orders for a record 717 jets valued at $53 billion last year for a 64 percent share of the world market, company officials said Tuesday, adding that this year should be as good or better.
Figures compiled by Boeing show the Seattle-based aerospace giant had net orders for 559 airplanes with a ""catalog"" value of $42.8 billion after excluding cancellations and conversion.
That compared with 301 jets worth $21.6 billion for Boeing's European rival Airbus Industrie, which took a 32 percent share of the market.
McDonnell Douglas Corp., which Boeing has agreed to acquire, took net orders for 38 jets valued at $2.2 billion for a 3 percent share of the market for airplanes with 100 seats or more.
""Our customers put us on top again in 1996 because of the superior value of our complete family of airplanes,"" Boeing commercial airplane group President Ron Woodard said. ""Our goal is to remain No. 1.""
Woodard told reporters he expected 1997 to be as strong or stronger and said 1998 could see orders continue to roll in at a strong level as the international airline industry expands after the long downturn of the early 1990s.
""Airplanes are flying extremely full right now,"" Woodard said. ""The orders we've seen to date are still catching up with what is a reasonable level given the demand.... It looks to us to be a pretty sustained, healthy cycle.""
Boeing's order book went far beyond analyst expectations or the previous peak years of the late 1980s.
""It's an unbelievable year,"" said Paul Nisbet, analyst at JSA Research. ""Nobody expected that at the beginning of the year.
Boeing's previous best year for total orders was 1990, the year the 777 was launched, when it took orders for 483 jets valued at $41.4 billion.
Calculating the order book each year is something of a public-relations exercise as airplane orders are frequently revised, cancelled or converted.
For example, Boeing's total is comprised mainly of firm orders, but the manufacturer also included its massive $6.5 billion order from American Airlines which was announced but not signed.
An Airbus spokesman said the European consortium did not include such ""commitments"" for an additional 172 airplanes received last year such as USAir Inc.'s stated intention to buy 120 jets worth at least $5 billion.
Nisbet said despite the gamesmanship, it seemed clear Boeing is on the way to its goal of a two-thirds share of the market, up from its historical 60 percent level.
Airbus will have about one-third of the market as virtually the only other player, assuming Boeing wins federal approval for its plan to absorb McDonnell Douglas, including its commercial jet operations.
The Airbus spokesman, David Venz, said the four-nation consortium still hoped to achieve its stated goal of a 50 percent market share around the turn of the century.
Airbus officials confirmed Tuesday they were negotiating with South Korean firms to help finance its planned A3XX jumbo jet, which would break the stranglehold on the lucrative top end of the market now held by Boeing's 747 jumbo jet.
Woodard said the business case for a new large jet was very difficult to make because of predictions the trans-Pacific market will ""fragment"" into less heavily travelled point-to-point routes rather than routes between the largest markets.
He noted that Boeing has not yet been able to drum up sufficient customer interest even to launch a stretch version of its 747, which would presumably be less expensive to develop than an all-new airplane.
Boeing delivered 218 airplanes last year, only slightly higher than the 206 delivered in 1995, when production was hampered by a 10-week strike.
Analyst Bill Whitlow of Pacific Crest Securities said he expected Boeing to deliver some 360 jets this year and 430 in 1998, based on announced increased in the company's production rates.

238,"Software giant Microsoft Corp. MSFT.N  plans to pay dividends to stockholders for the first time through a new issue of preferred shares, according to documents filed Monday.
The hugely profitable company, which has not paid dividends in its 10 years as a public company but has hoarded a cash pile that has grown to more than $7 billion, said it planned to issue $750 million worth of the new class of stock.
""We are responding to the desire of some investors for an income-yielding stock, while still allowing them to participate to a significant degree in the growth potential of our company,"" Chief Financial Officer Mike Brown said in a statement.
The preferred shares will protect investors against risk, guaranteeing they will get back their principal in cash or common stock at the end of three years along with quarterly dividends that will be specified at the time of the offering.
But investors will have only a limited opportunity to enjoy the kind of stock appreciation available to owners of Microsoft common stock, which has risen nearly 80 percent this year.
The value of the preferred shares will be capped at a percentage to be established when the offering is completed. Similar convertible preferred shares have been capped at 25 percent to 30 percent growth.
In the past, Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates and other board members have resisted calls for a common stock dividend, saying the fast-moving computer business required high research spending levels and the flexibility to make large acquisitions if needed.
Treasurer Greg Maffei said the planned issue of preferred shares was consistent with that philosophy, noting that the $750 million would represent less than 1 percent of the company's market capitalization.
""We dont believe the bulk of our investors want a common dividend,"" Maffei said. ""We believe that the best use of (cash) is to reinvest in the business. On the other hand we do understand that some investors want a common dividend, and we created a security that offers them the opportunity to become investors in Microsoft.""
The amount of the offering could rise to $862.5 million if underwriters Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley exercise options, Microsoft said in the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Pending SEC approval the offering could be completed in the next several weeks.

239,"An outbreak of bacterial food poisoning that sickened at least 13 children and young adults in the Seattle area has been traced to one company's tainted apple juice, health officials said on Wednesday.
Odwalla Inc, a rapidly growing fresh juice and beverage company based in Half Moon Bay, California, issued a nationwide recall of products containing fresh apple juice, and many retailers pulled all Odwalla beverages from their shelves.
State and county health officials said 10 of the 13 confirmed cases of E. coli food poisoning had been conclusively traced to the unpasteurized Odwalla juice and the remaining three were under investigation.
At least eight more suspected cases have been reported, Dr. Mimi Fields, the state's deputy health secretary, said.
""It's difficult to know where we are on the epidenmic curve, although I don't think we are going to see a large influx of masses of new cases,"" Fields told Reuters.
The outbreak was the state's worst since some 500 people became ill in the Seattle area and three children died in 1993 after eating undercooked hamburgers.
While adults may suffer diarrhea, stomach cramps or more mild, flulike symptoms after eating food tainted by the bacterium, young children are more susceptible to the disease and may suffer sudden kidney failure that can lead to permanent brain damage or death.
In the current outbreak, six children have been hospitalized, including two who required dialysis. Officials said all the children had been released except for one 2-year-old boy, who was in satisfactory condition.
The strain of E. coli implicated in the outbreak normally lives in the digestion system of cattle and can spread into the food chain through slaughterhouse contamination or   fertilizer
that includes steer manure.
Health officials said juice can be tainted when fruit falls onto fertilized ground and is not washed properly.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has launched an investigation and will be inspecting Odwalla's plant in Dinuba, California, health officials said.
""Our first concern is for the health and safety of those affected,"" Odwalla chief executive officer Stephen Williamson said in a statement. He said the company was cooperating fully with health authorities.
Although so far all the cases have been traced to Odwalla juice, authorities recommended that consumers in the Seattle area boil unpasteurized apple juice or cider for 10 seconds before drinking it until the investigation was complete.
Odwalla, which bills itself as the ""leading branded fresh juice and beverage company,"" distributes its beverages in pint plastic bottles to supermarkets and retail outlets in Washington, Oregon, California, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada and British Columbia.
In the fiscal year that ended Aug. 31, the company reported its sales rose 65 percent to $59.2 million from $35.9 million. But net income fell to $633,000, or 12 cents a share, from $997,000, or 22 cents a share.

241,"Declaring their belief that the Internet will be the ""next mass medium,"" Microsoft Corp. executives Thursday unveiled the new version of the company's MSN online service, with a heavy emphasis on entertainment programming.
Despite bandwidth limitations and other technical obstacles that make full-motion video impractical, many of the new MSN programmes resemble daily and weekly television shows, with the service organised into six core ""channels"" aimed at specific demographic groups.
In little more than a year, MSN has become the No. 3 online service, with 1.6 million subscribers. Company executives told a news briefing they expected to double that figure by mid-1997 and take market share from leader America Online Inc., relying in large part on a $100 million marketing campaign.
But the executives, conceding that the older America Online had a deeper and broader selection of content, said they planned to compete for new online customers, especially those under 30, rather than trying to persuade existing AOL customers to switch.
They were eager to heap criticism on the existing MSN service, launched along with the Windows 95 operating system in August 1995 but almost immediately overtaken by the rapid growth of the Internet.
""MSN was probably the worst of the bunch in terms of ease of use,"" said Laura Jennings, Microsoft vice president for the online service.
But she also noted that the service had been gaining 100,000 subscribers a month despite virtually no advertising and problems, including a computer snafu that has delayed bills to most customers for three months or more.
The new ad campaign will begin almost immediately with billboards and print advertisements followed by television commercials beginning in early November, when the service officially launches.
Microsoft also announced a new pricing scheme with an offer of unlimited access for $19.95 a month, instead of 20 hours for the same price under the current service. The minimum monthly fee will rise to $6.95 for five hours, in line with rival services and up from $4.95 for three hours under the current service.
The heart of the relaunched MSN is an uncluttered browser interface dominated by a promotional ""billboard"" in the centre of the screen and the six ""channels"" at the bottom corresponding to broad categories such as news, entertainment, education and children.
Clicking on the channels leads into programming developed by Microsoft and its partners that ranges from the MSNBC news service to new interactive serial programmes. Among the programmes demonstrated were quiz shows, a humorous daily news audiocast and magazine-type presentations such as ""Underwire,"" produced by and for women.
The service also includes electronic mail, ""chat"" and a more traditional menu of online categories that leads users to areas within MSN or out on the Internet.
Most content in the service will be restricted to subscribers using the company's Windows 95 computer operating system and Internet Explorer browser, and executives would not say whether they have plans to produce a version for the older Windows 3.1 system still used by tens of millions of computer owners.
Some features of MSN, including MSNBC news, electronic shopping and the planned Expedia consumer travel service, will be available at no cost to anyone with access to the Internet.
Patty Stonesifer, Microsoft senior vice president for interactive media, said the company's broad involvement in online consumer services was driven by ""our belief that the Internet is the next mass medium.
""We need to provide compelling reasons to go online and stay online,"" she said. ""There aren't enough compelling reasons to do that today.""

246,"Boeing Co defense and space group President Gerald King said the company's planned acquisition of Rockwell International Corp's defense and space business was on track to close in early December.
In an interview, King also said he expected the defense and space group to remain ""a significant part of the Boeing Co"" with 30 to 40 percent of the company's total revenues ""over time.""  
King said he expected federal regulators to complete an antitrust review of the planned Rockwell deal early next month. The proposal also needs to be approved by Rockwell shareholders at a meeting set for Dec. 4 and should close within a few days after that, he said.
""Something could always happen to the merger to keep it from going through, I suppose, even though it looks like a slam dunk in comparison with some of the other things that have been done in this industry,"" King said.  
Last year defense and space revenues of $5.58 billion were 29 percent of the company's $19.52 billion in revenues, with commercial aircraft sales accounting for the rest.
This year defense and space revenues are expected to be nearly flat, while overall company revenues rise to about $22.6 billion, reflecting growth in commercial jet deliveries, said analyst Peter Jacobs of Ragen MacKenzie.
The Rockwell acquisition will add about $2.6 billion in revenue to the defense and space group next year, and King said the company has no immediate plans for further acquisitions.
""We're looking only to make this one work first,"" he said. ""If there's a next step, we'll think about that later.""
King said the defense and space group continues to pursue commercial opportunities, including the Sea Launch program, which he said was on track for initial satellite launch in mid-1998.
King also said the company and its partner, Textron Inc's Bell Helicopter division, are offering a nine-passenger civilian version of their V-22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft that will be available in 2001.

257,"Chinese President Jiang Zemin will travel to Moscow in spring for a summit with Russian leader Boris Yeltsin, the official Xinhua news agency said on Tuesday.
The two sides are expected to sign agreements on arms reductions along the 4,300-km (2,580-mile) Sino-Russian border in the near future, Xinhua said.
Chinese Premier Li Peng is scheduled to visit Moscow next month, state television said.
The forthcoming trips by Jiang and Li to Moscow were announced during a three-day visit to China by Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
Primakov met both Jiang and Li on Tuesday, the television said.
Jiang told Primakov that China's long-term policy towards Russia was ""good neighbourly friendship, equality, trust, mutually beneficial cooperation and joint development"", state television said.
""No matter what changes occur in the situation, this guiding principle will not change,"" Jiang said of a pledge by China and Russia in April to establish a strategic partnership.
Jiang and Yeltsin last met during the Russian president's tour of China in April in a visit that both sides hailed as instrumental in forging a new, strategic partnership.
""We have a common objective of making our border a bond of peace, stability, cooperation and prosperity,"" Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said. He did not elaborate on the specifics of the arms reduction agreements or when they might be signed.
Border disputes between China and Russia have been longstanding, although the two states reached basic agreement on border demarcation in 1991.
During Yeltsin's visit, China and Russia -- along with the former Soviet states of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan -- signed a treaty calling for all parties to inform each other of the scope of their military exercises and agreeing not to attack each other.
The Russian foreign minister came to China from Japan, where he scored a major improvement in relations with Tokyo.
Japan released $500 million in long-delayed aid to Russia, while Moscow offered the joint development of a group of disputed islands in the biggest step forward in their ties since the end of the Cold War.

261,"China on Thursday warned the United States to stop selling arms to Taiwan, saying the issue could ruin relations despite the friendly smiles shown on Defence Minister Chi Haotian's current U.S. visit.
Washington's arms sales to Beijing's island rival would destroy the warming Sino-U.S. relationship that was vital for maintaining regional and world peace, the official China Daily said in a commentary.
""To continue to sell weapons to Taiwan will upset Washington's apple cart and eventually ruin Sino-U.S. relations,"" the commentary said.
Although Chi Haotian's long-delayed visit to the United States could help renew bilateral ties, Washington's policy towards Taiwan would continue to be a sore point in relations between the two Pacific giants, the commentary said.
""A friendly smile cannot ignore or wipe away the underlying embarrassment that exists bewteen the two countries,"" it said.
""The ties can be broken if the U.S. continues to sell advanced weapons and military equipment to Taiwan.""
Chi is on a two-week fence-mending visit that was postponed twice by wrangling over Taiwan.
Taiwan's procurement of U.S. weapons would only undermine peaceful reunification with mainland China by fanning sentiment for independence on the island, the commentary said.
""The sale of weapons to Taiwan will whip up whatever dreams of independence some people are harbouring on the island,"" it said, adding that Beijing would seek reunification at any cost.
""The Chinese government will not stand idly by and ignore any challenge to that goal,"" the commentary said, echoing a blunt speech Chi delivered to U.S. military officers on Tuesday.
Chi held talks with President Bill Clinton and Defence Secretary William Perry on Monday, pointedly refusing to renounce Beijing's right to retake Taiwan by force if necessary.
Beijing and Taipei split at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949 when the Nationalist army fled into exile on the island off the mainland's southeastern coast.
Sino-U.S. relations were strained in March when Washington sent two aircraft carriers to waters near Taiwan in the wake of missile tests and military exercises held by Beijing to intimidate the island in the run-up to its first direct presidential elections.
Washington recognises communist Beijing as the sole legal representative of all China but maintains the right to arm and even defend the island that Beijing regards as a renegade province.
Taiwan's Defence Minister Chiang Chung-ling said on Wednesday he was not worried that the thaw in U.S.-China military ties would harm the island's ability to procure advanced weapons from the United States.
Two days before Chi arrived in the United States, the U.S. Army announced it had awarded a $63 million contract to a Boeing Co unit to produce 74 high-tech Avenger anti-aircraft missile systems for Taiwan.
Taiwan has also been allowed to buy Patriot anti-missile missile batteries from U.S. defence giant Raytheon Co.
The Avengers and Patriots are to enter service by 1999, boosting the island's defences against China's People's Liberation Army.

262,"China on Thursday accused foreign journalists of biased reporting and urged them to learn from Edgar Snow, a U.S. reporter and author sympathetic to the Chinese communist cause.
Reporters from Western nations had misjudged China based on standards that did not apply to countries with different social and political systems, said a commentary in the official China Daily.
""It is common sense that news reporting...should serve the purpose of offering adequate information to the audience to help them form correct judgments on world affairs,"" the commentary said.
The commentary urged Western media to emulate Snow whose reports from China in the 1930s painted a sympathetic portrait of Mao Zedong and his struggling communist crusade.
The newspaper praised Snow for his accuracy, objectivity and impartiality in his coverage of China as it was swept up in the communist movement.
""In his reportage, Edgar Snow wrote exactly what he witnessed,"" it said. ""What the Western media are doing is the opposite of what Edgar Snow did 60 years ago.""
Most Western reporters were barred from China after the communists seized power in 1949 but Snow's personal contacts with Chairman Mao allowed him to roam much of the country unhindered.
His reports praised the Communist Party for its sweeping reforms and later denied rumours of widespread famine in the early 1960s.
Historians now estimate more than 30 million people died as a result of famines after Mao launched the Great Leap Forward, urging farmers to abandon their fields and join the rush to make steel in backyard furnaces.
The commentary blasted the Western media for spreading the theory that China was a threat to the world while ignoring what it said were Japan's rising military ambitions.
Foreign journalists are viewed by many Chinese as spies and most come under police surveillance during their stay in China. Many foreign reporters have been expelled since 1949.
Western journalism focused mostly on negative issues such as crime, disease and political turmoil, it said.
""It has been a general practice of the Western media to look everywhere for the seamy side of society,"" it said.
Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin last month sternly told the Chinese media to toe the party line and propaganda boss Ding Guangen last week called on the media to report more positive news.
""One may ask why there have been so many disappointing reports by Western journalists,"" the commentary said.
""One clue lies in the fact that those journalists do not know what is really going on in China,"" it said.

275,"China has urged the devoutly Buddhist region of Tibet to embrace atheism to counter the influence of the exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama and to raise itself out of poverty.
Beijing also lashed out at the European Union for allowing a meeting between officials of the European Parliament and the Dalai Lama, whom Beijing accuses of covertly working for independence for his Himalayan homeland.
""We have expressed our intense dissatisfaction and serious protest to the European side,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told a regular news briefing on Thursday when asked to comment on the meeting.
To check the influence of the Dalai Lama, China called on officials in the restive region to preach atheism and instill socialist beliefs.
""To carry out atheistic education is a neccesary condition for...opposing the Dalai Lama's disastrous teachings aimed at causing chaos in Tibet and splitting the motherland,"" the Tibet Daily said in an edition seen in Beijing on Thursday.
""Many people have been fettered by religion and cannot break free of its bewitchment,"" the newspaper said in its October 14 edition.
Beijing vehemently denies accusations by western rights groups of widespread human rights abuses and religious persecution, pointing to rising living and health standards in the remote mountainous region.
The newspaper said traditional Buddhist beliefs, such as canons against killing animals, including pests, had hampered development of the backward and sparsely populated region.
""A lot of technology, because it violates religious tenets, is difficult to put into widespread use,"" it said.
The newspaper accused the Dalai Lama of seeking to split Tibet from China and of using his faith both as a weapon against the Tibetan people and as a shield to protect himself from criticism.
""In order to expose the Dalai's trick of keeping the people ignorant and to smash the Dalai's plot to split the motherland...we should implement atheist education,"" it said.
The Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959 after an abortive revolt against Chinese rule and won the Nobel Peace Prize 30 years later for his peaceful campaign for autonomy.
During his meeting with European Parliament officials in Strasbourg, France, on Wednesday, the Dalai Lama reiterated the call for autonomy for Tibet.
""The action of the European Union is open support and connivance with the splittist activities of the Dalai Lama,"" Shen said.
The Dalai Lama's comments to EU officials were restrained, dismissing any notion of economic sanctions against China over its rule in Tibet and advising that it would be wrong to try to isolate China.
The Dalai Lama frequently meets foreign leaders in a globetrotting campaign to win autonomy for his homeland. China has vehemently opposed such meetings.
A meeting between the Dalai Lama and Australian Prime Minister John Howard last month infuriated Beijing, which demanded that Canberra rectify its mistake or face possible trade retaliation.

281,"China's defence sector and state-owned heavy industries are the country's biggest loss-makers but reform of the lumbering state sector is proceeding at a snail's pace, analysts said on Friday.
More than 45 percent of China's 68,800 state industrial firms posted losses from January to September, a rise of 17.6 percent from the same period last year, according to the latest data from the State Statistical Bureau.
""Those most in need of help would be the military industries and traditional industries,"" said Zheng Haihang, a professor of industrial economics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
Traditional industries included the coal and oil sectors as well as heavy industry, Zheng said by telephone.
""To put it simply, it's mostly these traditional industries, which have a very backward structure,"" Zheng said of the state sector's mounting losses.
Many of China's state-run enterprises are overstaffed and unable to compete in domestic or overseas markets. They also carry the heavy burden of providing cradle-to-grave welfare services for their employees.
The combined losses of state firms reached 65.12 billion yuan ($7.8 billion) during the first nine months of the year, a rise of 45.7 percent from a year ago, official figures show.
Compounding the problem is interest on unpaid debts -- a substantial burden even after two interest rate cuts this year.
""The debt burden of state-owned enterprises is very heavy, so of course this affects their profitability,"" Zheng said.
The January-September net profits of China's state industries fell to 11.28 billion yuan, down 75.8 percent from the same period last year, the statistics show.
Reform of defence industries -- many based in remote and backward inland regions and fitted with ageing technology -- had proceeded slowly, the economist said.
""Military industries are trying to transform into civilian industries, but the transition is extremely difficult -- there's no capital,"" he said.
Officials have said more than 200 state firms have been declared insolvent to date but Beijing has been wary of pushing ahead with bankruptcies.
Beijing fears that reform of state enterprises will lead to mass unemployment and eventually spark social unrest, said one Western analyst reached by telephone.
""That's one major reason why reform is going so slowly,"" said the analyst, who declined to be identified.
China's trade unions had set up a special fund this year to help workers in ailing state firms, the China Daily newspaper said on Friday.
""The relief fund...is designed to help employees from money-losing state-owned enterprises maintain decent living standards,"" the newspaper said.
Unions had raised 1.2 billion yuan so far this year to help about seven million impoverished workers in state enterprises and disaster-stricken areas, it said.

283,"A decade ago, Chinese publishers were still putting type in place by hand, painstakingly selecting one character at a time from thousands of inky stereotypes.
Then in 1986, Wang Xuan, a professor of computer science at Beijing University, created a software programme to represent Chinese fonts on a computer.
Today, nearly all of China's newspapers are printed using Wang's Electronic Publishing System, a product of the Founder Group Corp that he helped the university launch.
""Our Chinese word processing software was far ahead of foreign products, that's why we took the leading market position at a stroke,"" Wang told Reuters in an interview.
From Founder's modest origins as a college department offshoot employing 20 workers, the firm now has 36 subsidiaries employing more than 1,000 people. It also has a listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange.
Founder's net assets totalled HK$494.9 million at the end of 1995 and the company posted net profit of HK$109 million last year on sales turnover of HK$1.1 billion.
Wang, the 59-year-old chairman of what has perhaps become one of China's most successful computer companies, predicted the firm would continue its strong performance as the domestic market expands and it finds new opportunities abroad.
The company's net profit in the first six months of this year rose a year-on-year 7.0 percent to HK$55.8 million and turnover shot up 27 percent to HK$590 million.
""I can confidently say that we will see an increase in both turnover and profit in 1996,"" Wang said.
Founder is China's fourth biggest manufacturer of personal computers but Wang says he plans to focus his energies on the more interesting -- and lucrative -- software business.
""Selling personal computers is all about sales technique,"" Wang said. ""I get very excited about high-tech stuff, much more than business.""
Founder had snared 78 percent of China's publishing software market as of August, up from 70 percent at the end of 1995, Wang said.
The company also boasted clients among Chinese newspapers in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia and North America, he said.
Founder's office automation products were gaining popularity among Chinese banks, government agencies and advertising firms, he said.
Wang has visited numerous companies abroad and said he was confident Founder would crack the Japanese market in two years and be a strong player in the international market within five years.
As part of Wang's drive to boost Founder's role overseas, the firm signed a pact last May to develop publishing solutions based on products and technology of U.S.-based Apple Computer Inc
Wang listed Founder in Hong Kong in December 1995. Beijing University still holds 56 percent of the company.
Initially offered at HK$1.98 a share, Founder's stock shot up to a high of HK$4.0 a share earlier this year though it has since fallen back. It ended at HK$3.15 on Friday.
Wang's market success has earned the slender, bespectacled entrepreneur comparisons at home to Microsoft's Bill Gates, a likeness Wang is happy to embrace.
But Wang insists similarities to the American software guru are limited.
""The difference is huge. Bill Gates is 40, I am almost 60. I am past my creative peak,"" Wang said.
The entrepreneur notes other differences.
Like many Chinese his age, Wang lived through the tumultuous early years after the communist revolution in 1949.
That included the disastrous Great Leap Forward  -- launched by Chairman Mao Zedong in the late 1950s to spur rapid development. Instead, it set China back for years and triggered famine that killed as many as 30 million people.
Wang was persecuted for listening to English radio broadcasts during the Cultural Revolution, a decade of political turmoil that began in 1966 to infuse the young communist state with renewed ideological vigour.
While the Microsoft mogul has amassed a personal fortune of billions of dollars, Wang receives a salary of about 10,000 yuan a month and holds no shares in the firm he heads.

285,"U.S. Undersecretary of State Lynn Davis has arrived in Beijing for talks next week with Chinese officials on arms proliferation, a spokesman at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing said on Friday.
Davis would lay the groundwork for a visit by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher later this month, his first to China since a 1994 trip that ended in disaster because of wrangling over human rights issues.
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Robert Einhorn flew into Beijing earlier this week for expert talks ahead of Davis' visit, nthe spokesman said.
""Expert talks are going on today and she (Davis) will have her main talks on the 4th and the 5th on security issues and on proliferation issues,"" the spokesman said.
""She'll be going back to the United States to report to the Secretary of State,"" the spokesman said, adding that arms control would be just one of many issues Christopher would bring up with his Chinese hosts.
""He (Christopher) has a lot of things on his agenda,"" the spokesman said.
Sino-U.S. ties have long been strained by disputes over human rights, Taiwan, copyright theft in China and Beijing's terms of entry to the World Trade Organisation.
Washington has expressed deep concern over the Beijing court sentencing of prominent Chinese pro-democracy activist Wang Dan on Wednesday to 11 years in prison for plotting to overthrow the government.
Officials in Washington have said Davis also would discuss how the two countries might implement a decade-old peaceful nuclear cooperation pact that could allow sales of U.S. nuclear power reactors to China.
The accord, signed in 1985, has not been put into effect because of U.S. suspicions that Beijing is peddling nuclear technology to unsafeguarded nuclear facilities abroad, most notably to Pakistan. Both China and Pakistan deny the charges.
China agreed last May not to provide aid such as ring magnets and other devices used in making nuclear arms to unsafeguarded nuclear facilities.
U.S. officials have insisted they have no evidence China has violated the May agreement and say a reported nuclear-related deal between Beijing and Islamabad was struck before the accord was drawn up.
Beijing has tried to lure foreign technology, some of it with potential military value, with promises of lucrative business contracts.
Davis would also renew U.S. concerns over Chinese sales of conventional arms to Iran, which Washington has blacklisted as a sponsor of terrorism.
Washington is investigating reports that Indonesia and China are close to a deal to sell Iran five French helicopters that could be armed with air-launched missiles.

303,"One of the hottest topics at a recent Internet trade show was so-called ""push technology,"" which directly broadcasts customised news to computer users hooked up to the Net -- but is also seen as the next area ripe for a shakeout     Internet broadcasters are led by companies
like privately held PointCast Inc., which announced a major deal with software giant Microsoft Corp. early last month.
Cupertino, Calif.-based PointCast and several other start-up companies deliver customised news -- or specific Web sites, depending on the service -- to consumer or corporate computer users, up to several times a day.
In other words, instead of searching the Web for the information they want, computer users have it sent directly to them.
The Yankee Group, a Boston research firm, predicts that by the year 2000 Internet broadcasting will be worth $5.7 billion in revenues. It now represents about $10 million in revenues a year.
""Making the Internet a broadcast medium is a direction that a lot of companies are going in, but that's already really crowded,"" said Ted Julian, an analyst with IDC Corp.
At the Internet World trade show, four of the best-known push technology companies exhibited and demonstrated their services, trying to differentiate themselves amid all the hype about direct Internet broadcasting.
But analysts said there are anywhere from 20 to 30 start-ups in this burgeoning area, as many companies are betting the concept will further change the World Wide Web and gain new advertiser interest.
""This is the new Web,"" said Steve Harmon, senior investment analyst at MecklerMedia Corp., host of the Internet World show.
PointCast was the first company to develop what are called personalized broadcast systems, and it now has 1.7 million subscribers. It delivers news from The New York Times, Boston Globe, Reuters Holdings Plc., and now MSNBC, the cable television-online news venture of Microsoft and General Electric Co.'s NBC.
PointCast and most of the other start-up companies operate on the same advertising-based model. They sell advertising space on their service and offer the service for free to subscribers.
By building up lots of subscribers, they can gain more advertising revenue.
The deal PointCast signed with Microsoft has the potential to significantly expand its subscriber base because PointCast will become part of Microsoft's next-generation computer desktop. Microsoft plans to incorporate its Internet Explorer Web browser in its next version of its Windows operating system, which dominates its market.
In a study last month, the Yankee Group said the Internet broadcasting market will significantly affect the way companies collect advertising dollars on the Web.
""The Web is hitting a wall"" in terms of people signing up for paid subscriptions for information, said analyst Melissa Bain of the Yankee Group. ""The Wall Street Journal (Interactive Edition) is successful, but not every content provider has had success. Users can get the information elsewhere for free.""
Bain said that, according to her report, 51 percent of all online users surveyed said that they typically access or use the same Web sites on a daily basis, making the ""push"" model attractive.
But with many more companies arriving on the scene and Microsoft and Netscape Communications Corp. getting into the market, consolidation is on the horizon, because media companies will not want to develop a channel for each delivery system, most of which, for now, are proprietary.
""There is no way I am going to download all four of these, and I am in the industry,"" said Jerry Yang, one of the founders of search engine power Yahoo! Corp. ""This is a huge issue.""
But Yang said that Yahoo! and other Internet search engines are looking at push technology because it will enhance a user's experience with the Web.
""Look for Yahoo to do a lot of development with one of these companies, or a Yahoo!-branded push channel,"" Yang said in a recent interview. ""We will all experiment.""
At Internet World, StarWave Corp., one of Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's many investments, demonstrated a service it plans to introduce sometime next year. Patrick Naughton, StarWave's chief technology officer, said the service will be free and demonstrated a television-like advertisement for Levi's on ""StarWave TV.""
Even the players themselves are predicting a shakeout.
Harmon of Meckler predicts that push technology will fuel a hot new wave of Internet initial public offerings. But unlike the search engine fever, when a bevvy of small, unprofitable companies went public -- only to see their stock prices sharply decline -- consolidation will come first, he said.
Another player, Freeloader, was purchased last year by Individual Inc. of Burlington, Mass. Freeloader lets subcribers choose what Web sites they want delivered to their computers and obtain news via Individual.
""Clearly, there will be a big shakeout,"" said Freeloader President Sunil Paul, adding that there is a lot of chaos right now. ""PointCast clearly stands out, and we will be one of them (the survivors).
Another much-talked-about start-up, IFusion, is offering television-like content with video and audio in its service, which will be introduced early this year and called Arrive.
The company that created some of the recent frenzy about ""push"" technology is Marimba Inc., founded by several former Sun Microsystems Inc. employees.
Marimba did not exhibit at Internet World, but the Palo Alto, Calif.-based company, which develops software tools to create these ""channels"" using Sun's Java programming language, was mentioned by everyone. Marimba, along with PointCast, were seen as the potential early IPO candidates of this sector.

306,"Sun Microsystems Inc said it will announce on Wednesday an initiative with several industry leaders to standardize its popular Java programming language, which is widely used to develop Internet software.
Sun said International Business Machines Corp, Apple Computer Inc, Netscape Communications Corp, Oracle Corp and others support its initiative, which will guarantee a program is ""pure Java.""
The move comes amid recent industry talk that the Java language could become fragmented with multiple versions.  
Recently, there have been a spate of reports in the computer industry trade press about fears that Java -- which enables software developers to write an application in the Java language and it will run on any computer system -- will become fragmented like the UNIX operating system.
There are now at least twenty different versions of UNIX, which was developed by AT&amp;T Corp as a high-performance operating system for networked computers, and these multiple versions prevented its widespread industry adoption.
""There has been a great deal of concern about Java splintering,"" said Jon Kannegaard, vice president of software.  
The brouhaha started at Comdex, the industry's biggest trade show, when Microsoft Corp announced plans to develop several programming interfaces and tools for the Java language. The resulting programs developed with their software programming tools would run only on its Windows software.
""There really will be a tug and we are making sure that you don't give anything up by going with the 100 percent pure solution,"" Kannegaard said.
Wednesday, Sun will unveil what the ""100 Percent Pure Java"" initiative, which will provide education for the industry, developer assistance and program certification.  
In the first quarter of 1997, Sun will introduce testing, certification and branding for applications that pass its criteria. Sun, IBM, and Netscape will launch a worldwide educational tour aimed at training software developers to write and test Pure Java applications.
Sun said that it hopes its initiative will help contribute to the momentum that has been building all year around Java, a language it originally developed for interactive television.
""If we think of 1996 as 'the year of Java, the platform,' then we should think of 1997 as 'the year of Java deployment,'"" Kannegaard said.  
Sun said that a recent survey by Morgan Stanley indicated that 75 percent of the corporations interviewed were developing, or had plans to develop applications using Java.
Java - which is widely used to develop World Wide Web sites and content on the Internet - lets developers write a program once that will run on any system compatible with Java. Developers can also easily add animation and other features.
Over 200,000 software developers are now writing applications in Java. Sun said it will spend millions of dollars on its 100 Percent Pure Java program. Sun's JavaSoft unit is leading the initiative to standardize Java.

""We feel very, very good about the Internet as a business and about where we are going,"" Irving Wladwasky-Berger, the general manager of IBM's Internet division, said at a news conference.
The Internet unit was formed less than a year ago and has become a key strategic business for the world's largest computer maker.
IBM is helping customers develop a wide range of electronic commerce applications, including an electronic trading system, an Internet retailing outlet, and a service for buying electrical power over networks. Revenues, however, will come from the usual sources of hardware, software and services as it fuels demand for its products and services.
""We will continue to make money the 'old-fashioned' way, by selling a lot more systems, software, services and solutions,"" Wladawsky-Berger said. ""By leveraging our core businesses, we can sell more of what we are good at.""
He was not more specific about what kind of financial opportunity the corporate networks known as intranets and the Internet represent for IBM.
But IBM expects the worldwide information technology industry to grow to $1.2 trillion, from $800 billion, in the next four years, with 60 percent of that growth driven by network computing, he said.
One novel partnership IBM announced Tuesday was with Siemens AG, the German conglomerate, for the electric utility industry.
IBM and Siemens Power Systems Control announced a service to let electric utilities use computer networks, including the Internet, to sell excess power transmission capacity. Pacific Gas and Electric Co. is the first customer.
IBM also announced 13 additional new retailers which are joining its Internet shopping mall, called World Avenue, such as Gottschalk's, Hudson Bay, Avante Jewelry and others. Consumers can purchase goods quickly and securely via the World Avenue service on the World Wide Web, the graphical portion.
IBM also announced PetroConnect, a network-based service for the petroleum industry, with digital databases, maps, surveys, well logs, seismic data and other geographical and geological data, for all segments of the industry.
In another industry-specific application, IBM and partner Charles Schwab Inc. demonstrated its electronic trading system, called e.schwab, which lets customers request quotes, check account balances and execute trades on their Internet Web site, which runs on IBM's SP2 supercomputers.
IBM also touted Lotus' Domino software, which is the next version of Lotus Notes designed using Internet technology.
IBM said that Domino is one of the ""jewels in its crown,"" that will be targeting the Web server software market, which market research company Forrester Research predicts will reach $9 billion by 1999.

316,"CompuServe Corp is expected to announce on Thursday that it is dissolving its Wow! consumer online service as it gives up on the consumer market and refocuses on the corporate market, industry sources said.
A spokesman for the Columbus, Ohio based company declined to comment, saying he could not comment in advance of a ""strategic announcement"" CompuServe plans early Thursday.
The struggling online services company has been under more pressure in recent months from America Online Inc, the Microsoft Corp Network and Internet access providers.
The company plans to halt its marketing aimed at consumers and it will expand its emphasis on corporate customers in the U.S. and Europe. CompuServe will try to convert its 100,000 Wow! users to its core CompuServe Information Service and it will not abandon its current consumer users, sources said.
But it will not make the consumer business a key focus, as it cedes to the dominant America Online, which is growing its subscriber base again, after a hiccup in growth this summer.
Wall Street analysts said that such a move could entail some layoffs at CompuServe, and possibly a restructuring charge to cover Wow! employees who cannot be reassigned.  
CompuServe's move comes on the heels of some recent aggressive actions by AOL to stay on top with its plans to shut down its GNN direct Internet access and its announcement to cut its workforce by 300 employees and take a $75 million charge in its second fiscal quarter.
AOL also announced flat-rate pricing of $19.95 a month for unlimited access, bowing to the competition from Internet access providers and their flat monthly rates of $19.95.
CompuServe's Wow! service is a flat-rate service, for $17.95 a month, but it could not be learned if CompuServe will change the pricing of its core CIS service as it dissolves Wow.  
CompuServe hopes to move all its Wow! subscribers over to its core service by the end of January.
""They have a separate productions staff, separate marketing, etc,"" said Abhishek Gami, an analyst at Nesbitt Burns Securities, adding however that CompuServe has tried to keep Wow! extremely lean and some employees will likely be moved to the main service or to SPRYNET, its Internet service.
Since CompuServe went public in April, its prospects have dimmed, with its stock tumbling from its initial offering price of $30 a share. Its shares now trade at around $11-5/8, since it has announced losses and a drop in subscribers.  
""They have had a whole lot of problems since they went public,"" said one industry source. ""They need to reposition the company.""

320,"International Business Machines Corp. Monday reported a third-quarter profit that came in a shade better than Wall Street had expected, boosted by strong sales of personal computers and services.
The world's largest computer maker said net earnings were $1.29 billion, or $2.45 a share, for the quarter, compared with a loss of $538 million, or 96 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter.
Excluding a one-time charge of $1.8 billion related to its Lotus Development Corp. acquisition from the year-ago period, IBM's earnings were $1.3 billion in the 1995 quarter.
Sales grew 8 percent to $18.06 billion from $16.75 billion on the strength of PCs, minicomputers and computer services, IBM said. As expected, sales of mainframe computers declined.
Wall Street took IBM shares for a rollercoast ride after the report. They fell initially, then rallied on comments by the chief financial officer, and closed a fraction higher.
The midday rally took IBM to a new high for the year of $135.375. The stock closed at $130, up 75 cents.
The rally followed remarks by Chief Financial Officer G. Richard Thoman, who said in a meeting with analysts that he was ""very comfortable"" with the computer giant's prospects for the rest of 1996.
""I feel very good about the quarter and very good about the year,"" Thoman said.
But analysts still were concerned about company warnings that currency exchange rates, low prices for memory chips and higher-than-expected restructuring costs would hurt fourth quarter results.
""There were some cautionary comments about the fourth quarter,"" said Jay Stevens, a Dean Witter analyst who was among several who lowered their fourth quarter profit estimates.
Analysts said they generally were pleased with IBM's ongoing cost-cutting, its successful transition to new products in all its hardware areas and its investments in its growth. Revenue growth was also better than expected.
""I think the most impressive was the revenue growth,"" said Stephen Dube, an analyst with Wasserstein Perrella.
While mainframe computers no longer generate sales growth for Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM, they remain one of the company's important profit centres.
Thoman told analysts that more of IBM's mainframes sales were coming through its computer services business, and that IBM will not see the full impact of sales in one quarter for its new machines.
""If you sell a mainframe for $100,000 and you lease it or it's on a services contract ... rather than $100,000 at once, you have $8,000 a quarter,"" Thoman said in an interview, citing an example.
The company said revenues were higher in North America, Asia and Latin America but were flat in Europe. Revenue at its services division grew 26 percent to $3.9 billion, IBM said.
Total hardware sales rose 8 percent to $8.4 billion. PC sales, AS/400 minicomputers, and storage systems were up, while RS/6000 work stations, mainframes, and semiconductors fell.
IBM said pricing pressures hurt its semiconductor business.
Software revenues were off 1 percent to $3.1 billion, largely due to a decline in host-based software, which runs on mainframes. Distributed software revenues grew significantly from the 1995 period. Maintenance revenues fell 7 percent to $1.8 billion.

323,"Upstart satellite company EchoStar Communications Corp -- in the business only since March -- gave the nascent industry a major jolt this month when it cut prices sharply.
Then on Monday, Thomson, which dominates the satellite TV dish market, matched EchoStar's $199 price.
Thomson executives said the new price will surely shake up the industry and fuel sales for what is the said to be the fastest growing consumer electronics product ever -- one that even now is taking market share from the cable industry.  
""It will completely change the nature of the business,"" said Joe Clayton, an executive vice president at Thomson, the U.S. unit of Thomson-CSF in France.
The move by Thomson cut the price of the RCA brand digital satellite system by as much as $200 a unit. Combined with a $200 cash back offer by programming providers DirecTV -- a unit of Hughes Electronics Corp -- and U.S. Satellite Broadcasting Co, it cuts the total price to $199 for consumers who pre-pay for one year of programming.
The lower price will make it harder for new entrants in the industry to make money.  
""We know the telcos and the cable companies are getting more involved,"" Clayton said. ""We are going to capitalize on our strengths now.""
He added that the $199 price will make the ""awareness base explode.""
Thomson has an estimated 45 percent of the digital satellite system dish market, which amounted to 3.4 million units at the end of July, according to the Carmel Group.
""It's been a real winner for them,"" said Jimmy Schaeffler, an analyst at Carmel, a market research firm in Carmel, Calif. ""Plus it has launched them into the international marketplace.""  
Schaeffler said that, outside the United States, satellite television is gaining markets where there is no cable because it can leapfrog installing massive cable systems.
""Most of the rest of the world is not very cable wired, so there is a clear opportunity for direct broadcast satellite,"" Schaeffler said. Satellite TV is also becoming big in the U.S., as vaunted digital cable systems undergo trials.
New competitors see an opportunity in digital satellites -- a technology that is here now and working. MCI Communications, aligned with Rupert Murdoch's New Corp Ltd, already has a valuable U.S. satellite slot.  
When asked how low prices of the satellite dishes could go, Clayton joked he had never seen prices in consumer electronics go up. Analysts expects prices to keep falling.
""Maybe Charlie will take it to zero, but I don't think we will,"" Clayton said of EchoStar chairman Charles Ergen.
A spokeswoman said Englewood, Colo.-based EchoStar, which launched its satellite network in March, already has 125,000 subscribers for its programming, which has 40 TV channels and 30 of music, compared with 175 channels offered by DirecTV. The launch next month of a second satellite will increase its offerings to up to 200 channels, EchoStar said.

326,"After a turbulent first year on the Internet, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. will launch a revamped Web site on Monday with a new strategy more tightly focused on its well-known TV Guide.
The company's entertainment Web site will remain free on the Internet but will be renamed The TV Guide Entertainment Network with a new address (www.tvguide.com). The former name for the site was iGuide.
The new site will feature four areas including movies, music and sports in addition to television. Fox Sports and other Murdoch properties will also provide content, News Corp. said.
News Corp. expects money generated through advertising sales and eventual online transactions will allow it to turn a profit from the site in three to five years.
""Three to five years is the time frame,"" James Murdoch, Rupert Murdoch's youngest son who is vice president of music and new media at News Corp., said when asked about the goals for the site.
News Corp. is also embracing the WebTV Internet access device, which turns a standard television into an Internet access tool. Through an agreement with WebTV Networks Inc. in Palo Alto, Calif., it will develop customised TV-oriented content for WebTV.
Murdoch dismissed any suggestion that News Corp.'s foray on the Internet so far has been less than successful, even after the its partner MCI Communications Corp. pulled out of their joint online venture, the Internet directory service known as iGuide, last February.
""When something is at the very beginning in a new medium, it changes very quickly,"" Murdoch said. ""Like everyone else in new media, we've been evolving. A year ago, we redirected it. It's been a well-kept secret on the Internet. Now it's a question of reaching users and telling them it's there.""
Peter Krasilovksy, an analyst with Arlen Communications Inc in Bethesda, Md., said he believed ""iGuide is one of the overlooked sites on the Web,"" adding, ""it got lost in the corporate brouhaha between MCI and News Corp.""
Murdoch pointed to data from market research firm PC Meter, which counts the current iGuide site, before the new format being announced this week, as number 96 out of 3,000 Web sites surveyed, up from about 500th or so a year ago.
News Corp. hopes to gain repeat visitors who will check the site for TV listings. It can then build up demographic profiles to enhance the site for advertisers, including ways to target local TV audiences.
A big Web ""chat room"" with celebrities, specialised bulletin boards, entertainment facts, trivia and games are a few of the features News Corp. hopes will draw Internet users to the site.

328,"America Online Inc., the world's largest online service, Thursday reported a first quarter net loss of $353.7 million due to its widely-expected restructuring charges to change its accounting practices.
The Dulles, Va.-based company said its loss, of $3.80 a share, in the first quarter ended Sept. 30, included a write-off of $385.2 million in marketing costs it had originally planned to defer for up to two years.
The company announced its write-off plans last week when it also unveiled a flat-rate pricing plan of $19.95 a month, and a corporate realignment into three business units. Wall Street has largely applauded the changes in its accounting, because some investors said the practice inflated earnings.
AOL also said its total revenues jumped 77 percent in the quarter, including a boost from advertisers and electronic commerce. Revenues climbed to $349.9 million from $197.9 million a year ago.
AOL said its other revenues, from sources such as advertising and electronic commerce, rose to a record of $38.8 million, roughly 24 percent above the June quarter levels.
AOL said eight advertisers have committed to spend $1 million or more this fiscal year, as it moves to seek more revenues beyond its base subscriber fees, which still make up the lion's share of its revenues.
Before the big accounting charge, AOL said it earned $19 million, or 17 cents a share, exactly in line with the mean estimate on First Call, which compiles analysts' estimates.
Revenues fell slightly short of some expectations because of the one-day outage of its service in August, analysts said.
Abhishek Gami, an analyst with Nesbitt Burns Securities, estimates the almost 19-hour outage on Aug. 7 cost AOL about $6.5 million in lost revenues and to pay subscriber credits.
However, AOL said its customer retention rate improved as the quarter progressed, reaching its best levels in September since mid-1995. Customer churn rate, or the drop-off in new customers, has been an issue at AOL, particularly this summer when subscriber growth slowed.
AOL also said it saw strong subscriber growth following the September launch of its new marketing campaigns. It added 400,000 new subscribers in the first quarter.
With the addition of nearly 275,000 new members in October, AOL said its total subscriber count reached 6.9 million worldwide. Analysts said 35,000 of those subscribers were from its online service in England, France and Germany.
AOL also said average hourly usage improved to 6.95 hours per member in the recent period, and in October, hit its highest level in the company's history.
""In the spring we indicated that member growth would slow in the summer, but would likely pick back up in the fall as we rolled out our 3.0 software and increased our marketing expenditures,"" said AOL CEO Steve Case, in a statement. ""We're pleased to report that growth has indeed accelerated, and now....we believe we are poised for continued strong growth.""
Last week, AOL said it would write off $385 million in the September quarter to account for the balance of its hefty subscriber acquisition costs, such as its mass mailing of floppy disks. It had been deferring certain marketing costs and amortizing some costs over a period of 24 months.
Analysts said they are now waiting to see how the new flat-rate pricing policy will effect the company's profit margins, which are expected to decline from the plan. The heavier users of AOL will now simply pay an all-you-can-eat rate of $19.95 instead of the heavier bills they incurred.
Th company acknowledged in a statement that its new pricing plan will result in lower-margins but that it is also expecting benefits from new revenue sources in the future, as it seeks to generate new higher-growth revenue streams.
""These are all issues that will clear up over time,"" said Jamie Kiggen, a Cowen &amp; Co. analyst. ""Clearly the response to the new pricing plan has been very positive,"" Kiggen added, referring to the positive feedback AOL has received from customers. Analysts said AOL still expects to lose money in its second quarter ending Dec. 31, which will be the first period that the company expenses its quarterly marketing costs.
AOL's stock fell 50 cents to $24.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.

330,"Home use of the Internet's World Wide Web has more than doubled in the last year, with about 11 percent of U.S. households claiming to have used the Web in the last month, according to a study by PC-Meter.
The market research company said 11 percent of all 98.7 million U.S. households was equivalent to about 11 million homes and was up from 4.4 percent (or 4.3 million) a year ago.
In addition, 13.9 percent of households claimed to have used some type of Internet access service in the last month.
Twenty-five percent of these home Web users now visit shopping sites, PC-Meter's audience rating reports show.
According to PC-Meter's audience rating report, of the cybershoppers, men represented the highest percentage of users. In September, for example, 62.8 percent of Web surfers were men and 37.2 percent were women.
Four basic types of shopping are represented in the top 10 shopping sites; free software downloads, interactive auctions, clubs that sell to members and retail operations.
""These cybershopping statistics suggest that home surfers are increasingly finding value in electronic commerce opportunities offered on the Web,"" Pamela Smith, a vice president of PC-Meter, said in a statement. ""With the holiday season upon us, the greatest growth to date at these sites may well occur during the coming weeks.""
Shareware.com, a software service of online publisher C/NET Inc., was the top consumer shopping site on the Web, PC-Meter said, followed by Columbia House Co., which sells music CDs, computer CD-ROMs, videotapes and laser disks; and ZDNet's Software Library of shareware.
Columbia House and ZD Net were tied for the second most popular consumer shopping site. CUC International Inc., which offers discounts on a wide range of consumer goods and services, is the third most popular site and has the highest percentage of women among the top shopping sites.
Other top shopping sites included Amazon.com, at No. 5, which is a cyber-book store with more than 1 million titles to choose from. Surplus Direct was No. 6, with sales of computer hardware and software.
Coming in as the 10th most popular shopping site was Onsale, an auction site for computer hardware, software and consumer electronics. Onsale also led the category in minutes of usage per month, averaging 41.99 minutes per person per month.
PC-Meter said its results on home Internet use came from an October survey of 9,928 personal computer-owning and non-PC-owning homes. The survey is conducted on a quarterly basis. Its audience rating report is done monthly.
PC-Meter LP is a subsidiary of the NPD Group Inc., a privately held company based in Port Washington, N.Y.

Programming costs from $29.95 a month for 70 channels on DirecTV to $44.95 a month for all 175 channels on DirecTV.
The lower price -- while welcome for consumers -- will make it harder for new entrants to break into the market and make a profit.
Other consumer electronics giants, Uniden America Corp., Toshiba America Consumer Products Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. and Matsushita Electric Corp of America have announced plans to introduce new DSS systems later this year.
Thomson will make the dishes for Toshiba and Panasonic.

The move to cut prices to gain market share is changing the industry, which Clayton said is moving more toward a cellular telephone model, where the hardware is the lowest cost -- sometimes practically nothing -- and revenues come from services and programming.
""They have to fight within the industry and competitors from outside the industry,"" Schaeffler said. ""They are doing the rebates because of the market share. It's a combination of EchoStar pushing everyone to a lower price point nationally and the effort to maintain and acquire future markets.""

352,"Shares in EMI Plc, one of the world's five music majors, climbed on Tuesday after the company said that long-term prospects for the stuttering global music market were positive.
EMI, which demerged from rentals company Thorn Plc three months ago, said profit before tax and exceptional items rose 9.4 percent to 112.5 million pounds ($188.4 million) in the six months to September 30. Net interim dividend per share increased by 12.7 percent to eight pence.
EMI shares, under pressure in recent weeks on fears that music sales were faltering after a decade of strong growth, added 15p to 1,286p in a generally lower market.
""These are excellent interim results from the EMI Group,"" chairman Sir Colin Southgate said in a statement.
""They have been achieved against a background of variable growth in the major markets and mixed results from our competitors,"" he added. ""The increase in the interim dividend reflects our confidence in the long-term health of the music industry and EMI's position within it.""
Finance Director Simon Duffy said EMI remained confident that the global music business would continue to grow by some 6-8 percent annually in the medium to long-term.
""This year is looking a little bit below that level,"" said Duffy, saying that markets were patchy but that overall first half industry growth had been 5.5 percent. However, he added that the impact was diluted by the strength of sterling.
The market's sluggishness has recently been reflected by 100 layoffs at various labels within Warner Music and 400 job cuts at PolyGram NV -- another of the top five in the world music business.
EMI said that sales in the United States were almost flat and declined slightly in France. But this was offset by improvements in Japan, Britain and Germany while Southeast Asia and Latin America boasted particularly large gains.
Turnover from the EMI Music division was down marginally at around 1.1 billion pounds but improved margins helped to boost operating profits to 131.9 million pounds from 124.6 million.
The HMV division, grouping record and book stores chains, had an operating loss of 11 million pounds which the company said was in line with expectations as its international expansion continued.
EMI said major releases for the key pre-Christmas quarter included the third and final Beatles Anthology album, which entered the American charts at number one. It is also releasing a triple album from The Artist Formerly Known as Prince and the debut from British newcomers the Spice Girls. ($1=.5970 Pound)

358,"British mobile telephone company Cellnet on Friday reported strong growth in its customer numbers, confirming the British cellular market is healthy, already indicated by figures from rival Vodafone Group.
Cellnet, jointly owned by British Telecom and Securicor Group, said it had 2.68 million UK customers at the end of 1996, up from 2.3 million a year earlier.
Vodafone, the market leader in Britain, on Thursday reported a 20 percent increase in UK subscriber numbers over 1996 as a whole, reaching a total of some 2.8 million in December.
The market has settled down after a period of very rapid expansion at the beginning of the decade when mobile phones were a novelty.
However, analysts were impressed by the figures from Britain's two largest cellular companies and said there were signs of an increase in the rate of subscriber growth.
""Vodafone's performance was particularly creditable since historically they have done badly in Q4 while Cellnet did well, due to Cellnet's relative focus on the consumer market,"" broker SBC Warburg said in a research note.
Vodafone gained a net 146,000 UK subscribers in the last three months of last year once cancellations had been taken into account and said that its performance was an improvement on the corresponding 1995 quarter.
Vodafone shares added 4p to 244p on Friday, reversing the losses suffered in a generally weak market on Thursday.
Cellnet said its subscriber base had grown by 143,000 in the last three months of last year, against an increase of 215,000 in the Christmas quarter of 1995.
But Cellnet said that 1995 had been a bumper year and noted that the growth in its customer base was significantly higher than in the two previous quarters.
Both Vodafone and Cellnet are in the process of transferring their customers from older analogue networks to more efficient digital systems.
Vodafone said that more than 1.2 million of its UK customers were now on the digital network while Cellnet said it had over 880,000 digital customers.

360,"Investors on both sides of the Atlantic applauded the planned $20 billion merger of British Telecom Plc and MCI Communications of the United States Monday, boosting their shares in stock market trading.
British, European and U.S. regulators will subject the deal to close scrutiny amid strong opposition to it from rivals, including American long-distance market leader AT&amp;T Corp.
British Telecom, or BT, as it is known, said it was optimistic that the European Commission would clear the largest cross-border takeover deal in history, which will create one of the largest groups in the rapidly expanding global telecommunications sector.
Britain's communications industry regulatory agency said it was studying the details of the merger and it was too early to pass judgment.
BT Chief Executive Sir Peter Bonfield has said it could take a year to clear all the regulatory hurdles.
BT's shares powered 32-1/2 pence higher to 383 1/2p -- adding around two billion pounds ($3.3 billion) to the company's market value on huge trading volume of over 40 million shares.
MCI gained $1.25 to $31.50 in early trading on Nasdaq, while AT&amp;T fell $1.125 to $33.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Despite the large cost of the deal to British Telecom -- it will be the biggest-ever acquisition by a British firm -- the deal is seen as having a compelling industrial logic, linking leading phone companies on both sides of the Atlantic.
For BT shareholders the deal is also being sugared with a promise of a special one-time 35p dividend payout and a higher rate of general dividend increases in the future.
""It is positive for BT shareholders and positive for the (telecoms) sector,"" said Jim McCafferty, analyst at ABN AMRO Hoare Govett.
For customers, the deal promises better service and lower international calling charges, while for businesses it means a company that can support them wherever they are.
The merged company will be called Concert Plc. It will be the second-largest international carrier after AT&amp;T.
The deal values all of Washington, D.C.-based MCI at just over $25 billion. Since British Telecom already owns 20 percent of MCI, it will issue Concert stock and cash worth $20.1 billion for the remaining 80 percent. Holders of MCI stock will control a third of the stock in the combined company.
Larry Stone, BT's head of EU affairs, told Reuters he hoped the deal would be dealt with under the EU's fast-track merger rules and said he did not anticipate any anti-trust problems because the companies ""operate in competitive markets.""
Analysts expect British Telecom and MCI to start making overtures to major Asian players such as Japan's giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.
But while seeking an Asian partner, MCI appears to be putting another one on a backburner.
MCI is to cut its stake in a U.S. satellite television venture with media tycoon Rupert Murdoch to 20 percent from 50 percent, and has said it will probably not increase its stake in Murdoch's News Corp as originally expected.
MCI paid $1.35 billion for a stake of just under 9 percent, and could increase it to 13 percent with another $1 billion investment.

365,"Marjorie Scardino, set to become Pearson chief executive in January, rejects the tag of company insider and has vowed to carry out radical change at the British media firm ""if needed"".
Selecting an American woman to head a top British company was certain to raise a few eyebrows in the City of London. But initial doubts are paradoxically based on the fact that she is seen as part of the Pearson family rather than a newcomer.
""The message that this appointment puts across is that we can expect more of the same from the company. That's not what the market wanted to hear,"" said one media analyst.
Scardino, 49, is chief executive of business publisher The Economist Group, 50 percent owned by Pearson.
But she said that The Economist is run as an independent operation and she is not part of the Pearson establishment.
""I would like to put that one to rest - I am an outsider to Pearson,"" the mother-of-three told Reuters.
She said that she had spoken to the members of the Pearson board and had been assured that they were prepared to accept radical change ""if needed"".
She said she was well aware of press and market criticism of a lack of management focus at Pearson, a company whose activities range from the Financial Times to Australian soap opera ""Neighbours"".
Pearson has sold off businesses in wine, china and oil services in recent years to concentrate on three media-related areas -- Information, Education and Entertainment.
""I know this company has been broken up and put back together (by journalists and analysts) in all kinds of ways. I think I'm aware of all the possibilities.""
There was more bad press on Thursday as the market questioned her qualifications.
""She's apparently been very successful at the Economist but it's not the same as running a major PLc,"" said one analyst.
But she received a glowing reference from Economist chairman Dominic Cadbury: ""I am sure that she will move quickly to assess the Pearson business and define a new strategic direction which she will set about implementing,"" he said.
Profits at the Economist have more than doubled during her three years as chief executive. Scardino is also a director of U.S. food giant ConAgra Inc and British retailer WH Smith.
Born in Arizona but brought up in Texas, Scardino worked in the 1970s as a lawyer in Savannah, Georgia -- the hometown of her journalist husband.
By night she helped him with his weekly Georgia Gazette newspaper where he won a Pulitzer prize for his work.
She moved to New York in the mid 1980s where she headed the Economist's North American operations for several years.
She lives in the swish west London quarter of Knightsbridge with husband Albert. The couple have three children -- the youngest of whom is making a name for himself as an actor.
Indeed, Hal Scardino, 11, is maybe better known than his high-powered Mum. His films include Marvin's Room with Meryl Streep, Diane Keaton and Robert de Niro and The Indian in the Cupboard, for which he won a best child actor award.

Carlton, the country's largest commercial television (ITV) company, said it aimed to build on its broadcasting strengths in the multi-channel future.
""We want to build up our interests in pay television, both as a content provider and operator. These may encompass cable, satellite and digital television,"" chairman Michael Green said in a statement.
""Free television and pay channels should not be seen as competitors; they are complementary businesses...Carlton wants to establish a significant presence in both markets,"" he added.
Green was speaking as Carlton unveiled a 20 percent rise in pre-tax profit to 295 million pounds ($492 million) for the year to September 30. Carlton increased its dividend by 17.5 percent to 11.1 pence per share.
The figures were in line with analysts' forecasts but Carlton shares fell 8.5p to 495p in a weaker market.
Carlton last month agreed to pay 85 million pounds for Westcountry Television, the ITV company which broadcasts to the south-western corner of England. It also operates the ITV licences for the English Midlands and London weekday television and now broadcasts to 22 million people.
Green confirmed that Carlton was considering investing in digital terrestrial television, which is expected to be launched in Britain in 1998 and offer viewers up to 36 channels.
""Digital Terrestrial Television will expand free-to-air broadcasting in the UK and opens the door to the establishment of further pay television services. We are examining these investment opportunities very carefully,"" he said.
The Independent Television Commission (ITC) recently invited applications to operate the blocks of frequencies which will carry the digital channels.
Digital terrestrial will be broadcast from land-based transmitters and viewers will not need a satellite dish to receive it. They will, however, require a set-top decoder.
Carlton already has two subscription cable channels in the UK and pay television interests in France, India and Singapore.
Operating profits from Carlton's Television division grew by only five percent to 129 million pounds as advertising revenues remained flat. But the company said the outlook for advertising revenue was good.
Carlton's video division increased profit by 21 percent to 73 million pounds as demand for pre-recorded videocassettes continued to grow.
Its film processing arm boosted profits to almost 53 million pounds -- a 27 percent jump -- as the Hollywood studios continued their policy of releasing movies to large numbers of cinemas simultaneously.
The company's products division, aiming to become the world leader in tapeless editing for the television industry, increased profits to 43 million pounds from 32 million.

NRJ, a group which has some 500 stations spread across six European nations, has focused its attention on the capital's youth, who it says are poorly served by existing stations.
""Mainstream music for young people does not exist in London. You have too many stations for adults,"" Marc Pallain, NRJ's head of development, said in an interview. ""You have an extraordinary music scene and such a poor radio landscape,"" he added.

The frequency was vacated by easy-listening station Melody Radio, which relocated after complaining of interference in the south-west London area. However, the winner should be able to reach a potential audience of almost six million adults.  
Twenty-five groups have put in bids, including stations aimed at gay men and lesbians, children, London's Irish community and the over-50s. The front-runners are believed to include Capital Radio, Atlantic, XFM and The Edge.
Capital Radio, which already has an FM licence and is the market leader in London commercial radio, wants to transfer its ""Capital Gold"" oldies station from its AM frequency.
Atlantic, backed by the UK radio arm of Luxembourg broadcaster CLT, The Edge and XFM are all music-based and aiming at a 15-34 year-old audience.  
British actor Michael Caine is chairman of The Edge and his consortium also includes Radio One DJ and Channel 4 presenter Chris Evans. talent. Its co-founder is Chris Parry, manager of British band The Cure.
NRJ's ""Energy"" station plans to offer a blend of rock, rap and dance music which programme director Christophe Sabot says will be aimed primarily at the under-25s.
NRJ believes its network of stations across markets such as France, Germany and Scandinavia would allow it to give new British bands a European-wide platform.
Chairman Jean-Paul Baudecroux said that a London licence would appeal to many of the company's advertisers in mainland Europe. He said that the station could help to speed the development of radio advertising in the UK by giving companies greater access to young consumers.
Pallain said that NRJ, a company with a market value of some three billion francs, would aim to expand into other British cities if it secured a berth in the capital. He said that NRJ was already in talks with potential partners.

380,"British-based exhibitions group Blenheim is seen as an ideal fit with rumoured suitor United News &amp; Media, share analysts said on Monday.
United News &amp; Media and Anglo-Dutch group Reed Elsevier have long been seen as rivals for the hand of Blenheim. However, industry sources said Reed was thought to be out of the running.
""Blenheim's strength in Europe and France in particular mean it would be a good fit (for United),"" said one analyst. ""The exhibitions business is also doing quite well at this stage in the cycle.""
Dutch publisher VNU stirred the waters last week when it paid 500 pence a share to take a 15 percent stake in Blenheim. VNU declined comment on reports on Monday that it was set to increase its stake to 25 percent.
It said last week its 15 percent holding in Blenheim was a strategic long-term investment and said it had no intention of making an offer for the whole company unless rival offers emerged.
Its move is certain to have concentrated the mind of United News chief executive Clive Hollick, who is now reported to be weighing a bid of up to 520p per share, valuing Blenheim at some 480 million pounds ($757 million).
Blenheim shares closed 6 1/2p lower at 477 1/2p on Monday.
United News has so far refused to declare its hand. Analysts said a complicating factor was the continuing reorganisation of its businesses following its merger earlier this year with television and financial services group MAI. United News also publishes two British national newspapers.
""A bid makes a lot of sense but the timing is not good for United News,"" said media analyst Nick Ward of Credit Lyonnais Laing.
Blenheim, in which French utilities company Generale des Eaux has a 15 percent stake, posted pre-tax profits of 35.6 million pounds in 1995 on turnover of 202.5 million.
France was its largest source of revenue, accounting for 37 percent of earnings, followed by 26 percent from the U.S., 20 percent from Britain, 11 percent from Germany and six percent from the rest of the world.
Miller Freeman is the business magazines and exhibitions arm of United News. It operates in the U.S., Europe and Asia but analysts regard the American market as its main strength.
Analyst Anthony de Larrinaga of Panmure Gordon said a bid of around five pounds per share would represent an attractive deal for investors in both United and Blenheim.
He said that United was likely to be considering a bid between 480p and 530p per share. ($1=.6337 Pound)

381,"A $22 billion deal between British Telecom and MCI Communications Corp. that would create the world's second largest telecoms group looked set to be announced Sunday, sources close to the talks said.
BT said it had scheduled a news conference for 8 a.m. EST Sunday at its Central London headquarters following an earlier announcement that it was in merger talks with MCI Communications Corp.
A spokesman said he could not say what the news conference would be about, only that it would be in connection with recent developments.
Executives from BT and MCI were locked in separate board meetings on opposite sides of the Atlantic Saturday as they and their advisers attempted to stitch together the biggest deal ever in the rapidly expanding telecommunications industry.
MCI, the number two U.S. long-distance phone company, sent shock waves through the global communications industry Friday when it said it was in talks about a takeover by BT.
BT, the dominant player in the British market, has been building its overseas presence in recent years and already has a 20 percent stake in MCI. The two also operate a joint venture known as Concert which serves customers in more than 50 nations.
Analysts are speculating on a price of $40 a share -- valuing MCI at $28 billion and leaving BT with a bill of about $22.1 billion to pay for the remaining 80 percent of MCI.
The deal would be the second largest involving a U.S. company -- topped only by the buyout of RJR Nabisco by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
A BT spokesman confirmed that the BT board was meeting over the weekend to consider an anticipated proposal from MCI.
BT's nine-story corporate headquarters was a hive of activity Saturday as bankers, lawyers and advisers worked alongside the BT board. A BT spokesman said that the MCI board was also meeting in Washington.
BT and MCI have both said there are no assurances that an agreement will be reached or that any transaction will be consummated. They have said a further announcement is anticipated before the London stock market opens Monday.
BT had unsuccessful merger talks earlier this year with British rival Cable &amp; Wireless -- a deal which would have created the world's fifth largest telecoms group by revenue.
Any BT/MCI deal would spawn a massive company with a market capitalisation of some $64 billion, just ahead of AT&amp;T Corp -- the leading, but struggling, U.S. phone company. It would still be some way behind Japanese giant NTT Data Corporation -- the world's largest.
Analysts said a merged company would be a good fit in the ultra-competitive U.S. long-distance phone industry where MCI and number three Sprint have been battling AT&amp;T.
Its critical mass would leave it excellently placed to expand into other international markets and new technologies -- MCI possessing the biggest Internet backbone in the U.S.
""This is AT&amp;T Corp's worst nightmare,"" said consultant Jeffrey Kagan of Kagan Telecom.
AT&amp;T said late Friday it was confident any MCI/BT deal would receive proper scrutiny by the U.S. government.
""We would expect that our government would condition any such merger on the complete and unqualified opening of the telecom market in the United Kingdom,"" it said.
However, analysts regard the British market as broadly open to competition.
For its part, Britain's Trade and Industry Department (DTI) said Saturday it was too early to say what regulatory hurdles any merger would have to clear.

387,"Shares in Premier Farnell dipped on Monday after the newly enlarged electronic components distributor posted half-year profits slightly below expectations.
Premier Farnell was created in April when Britain's Farnell Electronics completed a $2.8 billion takeover of America's Premier Industrial Corp -- a company twice its size.
Pre-tax profit for the six months to July 28 totalled 56.1 million pounds ($88.4 million). That was down on the pre-tax figure of 71.3 million pounds a year earlier but that had been flattered by a large one-off gain.
More pertinently, analysts had forecast profit in a range of 57.5 to 61.6 million pounds and the failure to reach that level was reflected in a 10.5p decline in the share price to 670p.
The company said that the market for electronic components has shown much lower levels of growth in 1996 than in recent years and added it did not expect any major change in conditions for the rest of the year.
""I think the evidence is we've bottomed the cycle and the signs at the moment are positive. But we are planning on a more conservative basis at this moment in time,"" chief executive Howard Poulson told Reuters.
Premier said its priorities were the development and international expansion of the catalogue business and further exploitation of synergies between its transatlantic operations.
Poulson said he was delighted with progress on integration following an acquisition which had transformed the company, based in the northern English town of Wetherby, into the third largest electronic components distributor in the world.
""The integration is going superbly..I am very pleased with what people have done on both sides of the Atlantic,"" he said.
He said he did not see any further scope for cutting costs following the acquisition.
""I think we've finished with all of the cost-cutting. This was never a deal which was built on reducing overheads and getting rid of people,"" he said.
""We said we would remove duplication in our two head offices -- we've done that, we've probably dropped about 150 people since we made the acquisition."" The company now has some 6,500 staff, 4,000 of whom are in the United States.
""What the business is about now is building sales and building our profits that way,"" he added.
Premier Farnell said its sales expansion projects were on schedule and should begin to make a contribution in the fourth quarter of the year. REUTER

389,"Satellite broadcaster BSkyB, the dominant force in British pay television, on Tuesday reported a 66 percent rise in full-year profit to 257.4 million pounds ($398.1 million).
Annual turnover climbed to more than one billion pounds as the number of subscribers in Britain and Ireland rose to 5.5 million for BSkyB, in which Rupert Murdoch's News Corp has a 40 percent stake.
Profit for the year to June 30, 1996 -- up more than 100 million pounds on the 155.3 million reported a year ago -- was towards the top end of analysts' forecasts. The full-year dividend of 5.5 pence was lower than expected, however.
BSkyB shares shed seven pence to 530p in early trading, having climbed to record highs in recent days.
""The continuing growth in subscribers, the increase in the number of channels and the renewal of the Premier League (soccer) contract until 2001 provide a firm base from which to pioneer the development of digital television in the UK,"" chief executive Sam Chisholm said in a statement.
""The agreement with Kirch Gruppe to develop the digital platform in Germany gives us a great opportunity to extend our business into continental Europe,"" he said.
BSkyB plans to launch a British digital television service next year.
Last month it signed a deal with the group headed by Bavarian media mogul Leo Kirch under which it will take a stake of up to 49 percent in DF1, Kirch's digital pay television operation.
BSkyB is expected to inject 200 million pounds into the alliance to cover start-up losses over the next three years. The deal gives BSkyB access to Europe's largest television market.
BSkyB said spending on programming rose by 28 percent to 420 million pounds after the purchase of golf, boxing and cricket events and the launch of new channels such as Disney.
The programming spend is set to rise further following a 670 million pound deal signed in June which will enable BSkyB to retain rights to broadcast live English Premier League soccer for the next five years.
One cloud on the horizon is a report that British cable companies may seek European Commission intervention over the fees BSkyB charges for its top channels.
The Financial Times said the cable companies fear they will not secure satisfactory conditions despite BSkyB undertakings to revise the structure of its wholesale rate card.

400,"Privately owned British investment bank Robert Fleming on Wednesday announced increased pre-tax profits for the first half of the year which it said underlined its ability to remain independent.
""We are committed to remaining independent. These results, our second best interim results ever, show we can remain independent,"" a Robert Fleming spokesman told Reuters.
Flemings has been widely talked about as a possible takeover target for a larger foreign investment bank, but has resolutely said it would retain its independence.
Flemings said its pretax profit for the first half of the year had increased by 16 percent to 92.2 million pounds ($154 million), from 79.4 million pounds a year earlier but warned it would have to cope with difficult markets in the second half.
Some analysts said the increase was not particularly impressive given market conditions but chief executive John Manser said it was ""a very good start"" and showed new businesses were ""making a valuable contribution to profitability.""
""While the outlook for the year seems promising, flat Asian markets and heightened competitive pressures in other markets are factors that we will continue to have to contend with during the next six months,"" Manser said in a statement.
The Flemings official said the results showed that while Flemings may have been perceived as an Asian-centric bank, it was now a much more international operation and had succeeded in bringing down its cost income ratio.
Flemings has not had an easy year so far. In July it lost investment banking head Bill Harrison who was poached by BZW, the investment banking arm of Britain's Barclays.
And in August Jardine Fleming, a joint venture with Jardine Matheson, revealed a five-month probe by British and Hong Kong regulators into irregular trades by a former senior fund manager at Jardine Fleming Investment Management.
This resulted in hefty fines and voluntary compensation of nearly $20 million to clients. Regulators also withdrew the authorisation of Jardine Fleming's London-based fund company. In September the company's chairman retired and the group created a new supervisory board.
Flemings acknowledged the problems at Jardine Fleming meant the joint venture had recorded a ""marginally lower"" interim result than its net interim profit of $63.9 million in 1995.
This was after taking into account provisions ""arising from the regulatory issues relating to earlier years,"" it said. The Flemings spokesman told Reuters some clients had been lost, but new clients had also been taken on.
He described the events as a ""painful experience."" ""But we believe we have clearly drawn a line in the sand,"" he added.
Any impact these problems may have had on Flemings' overall business was not, however, reflected in the interim dividend which rose to eight pence per share from seven pence.
Flemings said it had seen strong profit growth from its fund management businesses adding that its securities business had reported ""a marked increase in profits aided by a strong performance by UK and continental European broking.""
Its capital markets arm had helped companies raise 13.4 billion pounds of new capital while its corporate finance division had completed 43 deals during the period.
The appointment of Manser, 56, to replace Robin Fleming, 64, who will retire as chairman of Robert Fleming Holdings at the end of March 1997, means Manser would be more involved in business development and winning new business as well as strategy and relationships with major clients and shareholders.
William Garrett, 50, who was hired by Manser as a fund manager in 1970, was named as his replacement as chief executive and chairman of the group executive committee. Garrett will be responsible for the day-to-day running of the group.

409,"Cable and telecoms giants Cable &amp; Wireless, NYNEX Corp of the U.S. and Bell Canada International on Tuesday announced the formation of a major new British cable player by merging the operations of their British subsidiaries.
This brings together C&amp;W's Mercury, British cable company Videotron, Bell Cablemedia and NYNEX CableComms.
In a related deal, Videotron is being bought by Bell Cablemedia in a complex deal which involves a $338 million equity investment in Bell Cablemedia by Cable &amp; Wireless and values Videotron at around $1.09 billion.
Videotron, which was already 26 percent owned by Bell Cablemedia, was the target of a long-running takeover battle, with Cable &amp; Wireless emerging as favourite.
Recent reports said German telecoms group Deutsche Telekom and International CableTel of the U.S. were also interested in taking it over.
Once the merger and the Videotron deal have been completed, Cable &amp; Wireless will own 52.6 percent of the new company - to be called Cable &amp; Wireless Communications - with NYNEX owning 18.5 percent and Bell Canada 14.2 percent of the shares. The remaining 15 percent will floated, C&amp;W told Reuters.
The groups intend to list the company, which will provide integrated telecommunications, information and entertainment services, in both London and New York. This is likely to take place in about six months, C&amp;W added.
Cable &amp; Wireless Communications ""...will provide local, national, international, data and mobile telecommunications, together with multichannel television and Internet services"" to around six million franchised homes and to businesses throughout Britain, the groups said in a statement.
Richard Brown, chief executive of Cable &amp; Wireless, said the new company would be the only company in Britain able to offer multiple services that until now people had to get from different providers.
""Cable &amp; Wireless Communications will be the only company in the UK capable of offering a combination of telecoms, broadband, data transmission, video shopping and Internet access,"" Brown said in a statement.
The companies outlined a number of benefits from the new company, saying it would increase its revenues by providing a wider range of services to existing customers and increased access to a broader customer base.
It would also produce ""significant cost savings"" by eliminating duplication, enhancing purchasing power increasing capital expenditure efficiencies, they added.
As well as the services it will be able to offer immediately, the new company will be strategically positioned to offer new products such as interactive digital services and multi-media products ""as they become available"", they said.

414,"CE Electric, the U.S. energy group, appeared poised to win its hostile bid for British regional electricity group Northern Electric Plc on Tuesday after Britain's Takeover Panel ruled against the target firm.
Late on Monday night the British company lost an appeal to the panel, which polices London's mergers and acquisitions market, to reverse an extension of the offer period for CE's 782 million pound ($1.3 billion) bid to 1300 GMT on Tuesday.
On Monday morning CE, which is controlled by CalEnergy Co Inc, said it had received acceptances totalling just over the 50 percent mark needed for victory. The offer was meant to close last Friday but was extended after an appeal by CE.
This extension was granted because CE raised concerns about the purchase of Northern Electric shares last week by its advisers British merchant bank Schroders and BZW, the investment banking arm of Barclays, and a discretionary payment of 250,000 pounds to BZW but not declared until Friday.
In its statement the panel said it had only been informed of the payment early on Friday but that while ""neither element of the fee arrangement was dependent upon the success or failure of the offer"", it was ""material information which ought to have been made known to the executive"" earlier in the week.
Northern in turn launched its own appeal against the extension of the deadline because at the time of the first deadline, CE had only gathered support totalling 49.77 percent and therefore fell short of the total needed to win.
But after a day of uncertainty on Monday, the panel said its appeal committee had ""unanimously dismissed"" Northern's appeal, that the latest time for acceptance of CE's offer should be extended and ""any valid acceptances and withdrawals received by the latter time should be taken into account"".
The panel also said the non-disclosure ""may have had market consequences affecting the outcome of the bid, bearing in mind the narrow margin between success and failure in this case"".
CE officials were not immediately available for comment but Northern, which has fought off CE's approach from the beginning claiming it undervalued the company, refused to throw in the towel and urged shareholders who had indicated they would accept CE's 650 pence per share offer to think again.
""It is now up to the market to decide. If shareholders do not wish this bid to succeed they should deliver withdrawals of acceptances to the Royal Bank of Scotland by 1300 on Tuesday,"" a spokesman for Northern Electric told Reuters after the ruling.
The spokesman said that in the event of the CE bid lapsing, Northern was willing to ""attempt to reach agreement with CE Electric or any other bidder on the true value of the company"".
By agreeing to effectively ""collapse"" a rule which says a bidder cannot come back and bid for the same company within a 12 month-period, the spokesman said Northern was opening the way for shareholders to withdraw their acceptances and reopen the debate about the value of the company.
BZW, which as a result of not declaring the discretionary fee from Northern at the appropriate time will not now be paid this part, said it had done nothing wrong.
""BZW has at all times acted in good faith and has risked its own capital in support of Northern's defence. Our fee arrangement was in no way contingent upon the purchase of Northern shares and the panel has permitted this purchase to stand,"" a spokesman for the firm told Reuters.
This is not the first time such uncertainty has surrounded Northern's future since it was privatised along with its 11 regional electricity company (REC) peers in 1990.
In 1994 it was the first of the cash-rich RECs to face a takeover and successfully fought off -- partly with the help of an extraordinary 560 million pound defence package -- a bid by conglomerate Trafalgar House, now owned by Norway's Kvaerner ASA.
If CE's bid goes through only two of the original RECs will remain independent, Yorkshire Electricity and Southern Electric.  
""It is now up to the market,"" Northern said, calling for shareholders to withdraw their shares from CE's offer by 1300 GMT on Tuesday, the deadline for the hostile bid.
""In the event that this bid lapses, the board is willing...to enter into discussions with CE Electric, or any other party, with a view to reaching agreement on an improved offer for Northern Electric,"" the utility said in a statement.
On Monday morning, CE said it had received acceptances totalling just over the 50 percent needed for victory.
CE's offer had been due to end on Friday, when it had only gathered support totalling 49.77 percent of the total. However, the Takeover Panel extended the deadline after CE appealed, questioning the purchase of Northern Electric shares by its advisers, Schroders and BZW, and a discretionary payment of 250,000 pounds to BZW.

415,"Britain's Invesco Plc Monday agreed to merge with Houston-based mutual fund company AIM Management Group Inc. in a deal valued at $1.6 billion, creating one of the world's largest investment management businesses.
The deal is the largest in U.S. fund history, industry experts said.
The combined group will be called Amvesco Plc and have around $150 billion under management. The merger will be paid for with about $1.1 billion in new stock and the rest in cash and debt, Invesco officials said.
""We are creating a prototype company for the future,"" Bob McCullough, Invesco's chief financial officer, said in an interview.
Invesco Chairman Charles Brady, who will lead the combined group, said it would have ""the scale necessary for success as a financially strong and independent business operating in an increasingly concentrated industry.""
McCullough stressed the deal was a merger of the two companies, which would focus on growing revenue but retain their individual identities.
""They're buying themselves into the U.S. money management market,"" said Bruce Brewington, an equity analyst at Putnam, Lovell &amp; Thorton, an investment banking firm in San Francisco.
Martin Cross, analyst at UBS, said Invesco is buying at the top of the Wall Street market, which many experts see as overpriced. He said UBS strategists are forecasting a 15 percent downward correction in the Dow Jones industrial average next year, and if it occurs, it would leave AIM looking rather expensive.
""The deal is exquisitely timed for the AIM shareholders and conversely not so exquisitely for Invesco shareholders,"" Cross said.
Invesco said it would fund the deal by issuing 290 million new shares to AIM shareholders. These would be valued at about $1.1 billion. AIM shareholders will own around 45 percent of the merged company.
McCullough said another $500 million needed to fund the merger would come in the form of cash and debt.
The merger presented a chance for the two companies to use different distribution channels and approaches. McCullough said he did not forsee any culture clash between the two.
There would be no change in their differing approaches, with Invesco continuing to be a ""no-load"" house, selling products direct to the customer, and AIM selling its nearly three dozen funds through brokers.
McCullough said the cost of the merger was not excessive.
""There's no question that it is a lot of money, but we view this as a long-term investment for both of us,"" he said. The long-term commitment was underlined by the fact that almost 50 percent of the combined shares would be held by management.
Both companies were ""really active managers"" and would stay that way rather than moving to passive management, McCullough said, adding that Invesco's global infrastructure presented a major opportunity.
He denied the heavy exposure to the United States would hinder Invesco from making the most of opportunities in other parts of the world. ""We would like nothing better than to find opportunities in Asia and Europe,"" he said.
The merger would enhance the group's strength in the United States and lead to cost savings, officials said.
McCullough said the merger must be approved by Invesco and AIM shareholders and other approvals were required. The deal should be completed early next year, the company said.

417,"Hunting so-called ""fat cats"" - the biggest company boardroom earners - may have become a British media obsession but the pay packets of the country's top players are under even closer scrutiny from institutional shareholders.
The latest row, between electronics giant General Electric Co and some of its major shareholders who objected to a 10 million pound ($15.61 million) five-year package for new managing director George Simpson, resulted in GEC setting tougher performance targets.
But questions remain over how much the individuals charged with running some of Britain's most, and in some cases least, successful companies deserve to be paid and have led to a reappraisal of the fundamentals of corporate governance.
Both last year's Greenbury committee on executive pay and the earlier Cadbury report on corporate governance laid down guidelines on how companies should behave. But not all the rules are compulsory and some firms have opted not to toe the line.
This has led to a more active approach by leading institutional shareholders like Norwich Union and has seen greater involvement from bodies such as the Association of British Insurers and the National Association of Pension funds.
""Institutional shareholders are paying a lot more attention to these issues, not perhaps out of choice but because of circumstances. We do think remuneration issues are important but perhaps get more publicity than they should,"" Anita Skipper, corporate governance manager at Norwich Union told Reuters.
Skipper said the group, which has been looking at corporate governance issues for more than a decade, does not generally give a view on the general package an executive receives, but tries to ensure a company's performance justifies the benefit.
This means close scrutiny of every aspect of the company's performance, including factors such as its return on capital, cashflow, the way it is managed and its prospects.
""It's good to see the big investing institutions flexing their muscles and taking an active interest in this way,"" one industry insider told Reuters.
Last week Tim Melville-Ross, director general of the Institute of Directors, rallied behind Simpson, arguing that very few people were capable of doing the job.
Melville-Ross also sat on the Greenbury panel which urged the remuneration committees - which decide directors' salaries - to take into account the wider scene, including pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the company and industry.
A row over a new executive bonus scheme at British power and water giant United Utilities in July fuelled public outrage at the million-pound packages that executive directors of monopoly utilities have managed to amass since privatisation.
Last year, chairman of Marks and Spencer Sir Richard Greenbury was given the job of attempting to impose curbs following public outrage over the pay of Cedric Brown, formerly the chief executive of British Gas.
""That was a watershed. That was what raised public awareness of the issue (of directors' pay),"" Norwich Union's Skipper said.
The Greenbury committee said a number of privatised water and energy companies ""have developed, perhaps unintentionally, remuneration packages which are richer than required to recruit, retain and motivate quality managers"".
Skipper maintains that revealing directors' pay is a requirement of good corporate governance. ""It should be there for shareholder scrutiny,"" she said.
But her view is not appreciated by all directors. One director of a quoted financial institution, recently told Reuters he was firmly against having his salary and pension details published not least because of the potential personal repurcussions.
His mother-in-law happens to be a shareholder and receives the company's annual report and accounts and he confided that she has since hinted she will re-write her will in favour of her other children.

The union said in a statement that the ballot of more than 1,000 workers at Tradeteam would start on December 9 and the result would be known on December 20.
Bass said there was no threat to the delivery of drinks to its customers in the run up to the busy Christmas period.
The T&amp;G said the ballot was going ahead after an attempt by Tradeteam, a joint venture between Bass and NFC, to have it halted by a legal injunction failed on Friday.
""Since Bass established Tradeteam in a joint venture with Exel Logistics, management has been trying to cut wages by 100 stg per week and impose inferior working conditions in order to save 10 million stg a year,"" the union said.
It said Tradeteam had also rejected T&amp;G attempts to establish national bargaining. The T&amp;G said a Liverpool judge had refused to grant an injunction to stop the ballot.
""Bass Brewers Ltd is a very profitable company, which made over 157 million pounds profit over the last year. Their aim at Tradeteam has been to cut the wages of draymen and warehouse workers, many of whom have given over 20 years' loyal service to the company,"" T&amp;G national secretary for the drinks industry Brian Revell said.
Draymen deliver beer and other drinks to pubs.
""I am pleased that the judge refused the injunction. We are prepared for a long battle with Bass until it honours its responsibilities,"" he added.
A spokesman for Tradeteam, which is 50.1 percent owned by NFC, denied a trade dispute existed with the union.
""There is no trade dispute with the T&amp;G. Current settlements on pay and conditions between Tradeteam and its staff represented by the T&amp;G have been made with full agreement of the T&amp;G at local branch level,"" he told Reuters.
""To agree to national wage agreements would mean Tradeteam would be totally out of step with the rest of the industry.""
He said the union had been involved throughout the consultation process. This had resulted in the current terms and conditions for staff at each of the local offices at which the T&amp;G was represented, he added.
Bass Brewers said the decision to vote on strike action would not affect beer deliveries over Christmas.
""Obviously the strike issue is one for Tradeteam but we want to reassure customers this will not affect their beer deliveries during or before the Christmas period,"" Stewart Cain of Bass Brewers told Reuters.

McCullough said the merger, which is conditional on approval by both Invesco and AIM shareholders and other approvals, would be non-dilutive and would not have any cost savings built-in. However, there would be cost savings in the future, he said.
The merger is not expected to be completed before February.
McCullough also said the $500 million needed to fund the merger would come in the form of cash and debt, with a one-for-five rights offering on the cards. This would involve issuing roughly 50 million new shares, he said.
McCullough said the cost of the merger was not excessive. ""If you look at it on the basis of funds under management, it (the cost) is less than three percent,"" he said.
""There's no question that it is a lot of money, but we view this as a long-term investment for both of us,"" he said. This long-term commitment was underlined by the fact that almost 50 percent of the combined shares would be held by management.
The merger presented an enormous number of synergies, with the two companies using different distribution channels and approaches. McCullough said he did not forsee any culture clash between the two.
There would be no change in their differing approaches, with Invesco continuing to be a ""no-load"" house, selling products direct to the customer, and AIM making its sales through intermediaries.
Both companies were ""really active managers"" and would stay that way rather than moving to passive management, McCullough said, adding that Invesco's global infrastructure presented a major opportunity.
He denied the heavy exposure to the U.S. would hinder Invesco from making the most of opportunities in other parts of the world. ""We would like nothing better than to find opportunities in Asia and Europe,"" he said.

420,"Even if British media and leisure group Pearson decides to sell its interest in merchant banking group Lazards, the bank would not be under immediate threat from larger rivals, banking sources said on Monday.
Marjorie Scardino's accession last week as Pearson chief executive has prompted widespread talk that Pearson would sell its 50 percent in Lazard Partners, which owns the three Lazard houses in London, Paris and New York.
But a pre-emption agreement in cross-shareholdings between Lazards and Pearson would ensure the partnership has first refusal on its own shares if Pearson decides to sell its stake, thus preventing the family-run merchant bank from falling into the hands of larger and expanding international rivals.
""This (speculation) is prompted by the fact that Pearson has a new chief executive who will obviously want to review things,"" one senior corporate financier told Reuters, adding that the pre-emption agreement meant Lazards ""either stays with Pearson or comes within the Lazard empire fully"".
Officials at both Pearson and Lazard Brothers in London declined to comment on talk of a possible sale.
Pearson has a 50 percent stake in London's Lazard Brothers and smaller nine percent stakes in Lazard Freres in Paris and New York. Its 50 percent stake in the umbrella group Lazard Partners was negotiated during the 1980s.
Analysts suggest Lazards does not fit into Pearson's main information, education and entertainment divisions and is therefore a target for being spun off. But banking sources point out that Lazards has been a profitable venture and not a drain.
""It (Lazards) has not required any capital or management time (from Pearson),"" the senior financier added.
Pearson, in its 1995 annual report and accounts, points out that its ""close ties to the three Lazard investment banking houses again proved their worth in 1995"".
It highlighted attributable profits of 39.9 million pounds from the group for that year. If Pearson, described by Michel David-Weill -- senior partner of Lazard Freres in Paris -- as a ""great partner"" to Lazards since 1919, decides to sever its ties with the merchant bank, there could also be other complications.
The Lazard group, which has successfully specialised in corporate finance advisory work as well as asset mangagment and trading activities, holds 48 million Pearson shares.
The Financial Times at the weekend quoted David-Weill as saying Lazards might decide to sell this 360 million pound ($600 million) stake to finance a buy-back of Pearson's holding.
The newspaper said David-Weill had said the Lazards holding in Pearson was equivalent in value to Pearson's Lazard stake.
Although Lazards's stake has been seen as obstacle to a takeover attempt against Pearson, it might sell its shares on the market but in discussion with the group and ""not to a party which could be hostile"", David-Weill told the paper.
While Scardino's role at Pearson has been the subject of close scrutiny since her appointment, Lazards have also been in the news, with suggestions of a power-struggle over who will succeed 64-year-old David-Weill.
David-Weill said last week there was no succession crisis at the bank, adding he still had time. Under the bank's statutes, he can remain at the helm for another eight years. ($1=.5974 Pound)

427,"British property company Greycoat Plc, under fire from a group of shareholders calling for it to be broken up, said on Monday it was confident of getting the support of its institutional shareholders in rejecting the plan.
""I would be very surprised if they (Greycoat's institutional shareholders) would come down on the side of a closing down sale,"" Greycoat's chief executive Peter Thornton told Reuters.
Thornton said he believed the liquidation proposal by the UK Active Value Fund, which will be put to shareholders in 10-days time, was ""ill-conceived and fails to secure shareholder value"".  
Earlier Greycoat wrote to its shareholders urging them to reject the resolution, put forward by rebel shareholder Brian Myerson, at an extraordinary general meeting on November 14.
Myerson's Active Value Advisors Ltd (AVA) advises the UK Active Value Fund and is expected to put out its own response to the statement later today.
Last month Myerson said it was time to ""unlock the value of Greycoat"" as the company's shares stood at a 23 percent discount to the forecast net asset value for 1997.
He said there was ""considerable support"" for the proposal to dispose of Greycoat's assets and enhance shareholder value.  
Greycoat, which focuses on central London office developments, earlier announced a rise in interim pre-tax profits to 3.8 million stg and predicted a final dividend of 1.2 pence per share.
Thornton said the results showed the company was having a very good year, adding it was well placed to take advantage of favourable investor sentiment on the central London property market. ""The whole market is moving in our direction,"" he said.
The share discount to net asset value had been worsened by the fact that UKAV held 10 percent of the shares and this was overhanging the market, he added.  
Martin Poole, Greycoat's finance director, said the company had got its long-term debt in place, adding that its lender banks were not in any way ruffled by the current uncertainty.
""The novelty has worn off from the bank's point of view,"" Poole told Reuters. To get rid of the bank debt, which would be required by any liquidation plans, would cost ""roughly 10 million stg"", he added.
Poole said he expected good growth in the dividend in the medium term, in line with the group's policy of progressively increasing it. ""There is no reason why we shouldn't continue at the higher rate of profit,"" he said.  
While Greycoat does not intend to use further resources on development sites, it is likely to use the cash generated by the sale of its Buckingham Palace Road property for investment.
Thornton said discussions were already underway with several parties, but he stressed the company would not pay over the odds, would not compromise on what it wanted and would not buy anything in the market.
Rather than concentrating on a single asset, there would be two or three purchases or ""possibly more"". Greycoat had around 50 million stg to spend and this would be geared up to around 50 million stg cash and the same amount of debt, Thornton added.

442,"Lloyd's insurance market on Tuesday welcomed a crucial U.S. district court ruling in its favour and said it would extend a deadline for acceptances of a 3.2 billion pound ($5.5 billion) recovery plan.
""We have decided in the circumstances we will keep the offer open,"" Lloyd's chairman David Rowland said after a district court in Baltimore, Maryland, overturned an injunction by U.S. Names -- as investors in the market are known -- who were unhappy with the plan.
Rowland did not say how long the deadline would be extended from noon (1100 GMT) on Wednesday, but insurance sources said it would probably be stretched for several days to allow more U.S. Names to approve the plan.
A Lloyd's spokesman said the ruling had removed the last major legal obstacle to the 300-year-old insurance market's recovery plan, aimed at ending years of turbulence triggered by huge liabilities.
Lloyd's earlier said more than 82 percent of its 34,000 worldwide members had approved the plan, but only 53 percent of the 2,700 U.S. names had given the go-ahead.
""Since we won the appeal, faxes have been flooding in from U.S. Names accepting the settlement offer,"" a Lloyd's spokesman said by telephone.
Lloyd's hopes the support shown by Names will be enough to declare the plan unconditional when its ruling council meets on Thursday. The plan still has to be approved by the Department of Trade and Industry.
Lloyd's problems began in the 1980s when a fatal combination of negligent underwriting, poor investment advice and a sequence of unexpected natural disasters conspired to bring about losses of several billion pounds.
Long standing Names were for the first time in their lives suddenly faced with the prospect of unlimited losses.
A spokesman for one of the three key litigating British action groups representing major loss-making Names described the successful appeal as ""very good"" for the recovery plan.
""I think we did better by the settlement than by going through the courts,"" said the spokesman for the Merrett 418 Names Association, which groups 1,932 members.
Under the proposals, Lloyd's will reinsure its massive liabilities in a new company called Equitas. It is asking investors to help fund Equitas but has offered them a compensation package to help offset their losses.
Rowland said he was delighted by the U.S. ruling, which overturned a injunction granted by a lower court to a group of U.S. Names who wanted more time to study the terms of the settlement.
""I am very pleased. I have believed for a long time that what we are doing is in the interest of the whole society,"" Rowland told Reuters, adding he did not want to exclude anyone from the offer.
Many of the market's pre-1993 liabilities stem from pollution and asbestosis related claims in the United States, some of them dating back even to the last century.

447,"European privatisations in 1997 could total a record $53 billion, with the telecommunications and utilities sectors expected to dominate activity, U.S. investment bank J.P. Morgan said in a report on Monday.
""Compared with last year, we expect a significantly higher number of IPOs (Initial Public Offerings)...Italy stands out as having the most ambitious (privatisation) programme, at close to $20 billion,"" said Caroline Meroz, one the survey's authors.
The report said in the run up to Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), European governments ""may feel under increasing pressure to accelerate...privatisation programmes to place themselves on track to meet the Maastricht three percent deficit criterion"".
Proceeds could be used to reduce government's financial debt, although they cannot be taken into account when calculating the deficit.
It said proceeds of European privatisations in 1996 totalled a record $43 billion, a 30 percent increase on the previous high in 1994, bringing the total value of the European privatisation programme so far to $230 billion.
And the total estimate for the proceeds of privatisations through to the end of the century could total $118 billion, according to the report, which was based on 53 enterprises which governments have confirmed they plan to privatise.
Meroz told Reuters that the utility sector had shown the greatest slippage on scheduled privatisations for 1996 with a completion rate of only 20 percent, but that otherwise it had been ""a pretty good year"".
This had been fuelled by strong European equity markets which, excluding Britain, rose by 26 percent over the year and also by ""the variety of small innovative deals such as share buy-backs,"" Meroz said.
Such buy-backs could, Meroz said, be used by governments to dispose of residual holdings in companies during 1997.
The report said the energy sector accounted for a larger than expected portion of offerings while the privatisations of Deutsche Telekom and Italy's ENI ""together accounted for 25 percent of 1996 proceeds"".
Demand for future offerings should be well suppored by growing domestic interest and J.P. Morgan forecasts that foreign tranches will be closer to 40 percent than the 50 percent take-up by foreign investors expected in the past.
""The market has been able to absorb a lot of equities. We think the demand is there,"" Meroz said, adding there would be strong retail as well as institutional demand.
Some of the major privatisations planned for 1996 which failed to see the light of day were included in the report's 1997 estimates but the rest ""may be cancelled (or possibly postponed to much later years) or may be carried out through alternative methods, such as private sales"".
But a lack of mix of new ideas, both in terms of sectors and the countries the privatisations hail from, could have a dampening effect on the market in 1997, with privatised stocks seldom able to offer the upside of consumer recovery.

455,"British sugar and starch producer Tate and Lyle reported an 11 percent fall in full year profits to 276 million pounds ($463 million) on Wednesday after an earnings drop of more than 50 percent at its U.S. subsidiary Staley.
But the company's shares rose 9-1/2 pence to 479-1/2 after touching 482 as company executives made positive noises about the current trading environment for corn miller Staley, with corn prices now at more normal levels and demand rising for ethanol, which is extracted from the corn.
The price of corn now at $2.60 a bushel has settled after a much larger crop this summer of 9.3 billion bushels, Tate chief executive Larry Pillard told Reuters in an interview.
""I would like to think futures prices will stay at about $2.60 a bushel. At this time last year they were up by 33 percent at 3.50 and as high as five dollars a bushel at mid-year. That's unprecedented, the highest price for 120 years,"" he said.
Staley was severely squeezed last year. On the one hand by very high corn prices, which doubled after a low U.S. corn crop, and increased competition from new producers of high fructose corn syrup and on the other hand by its inability to pass this added cost onto customers.
""Conditions have reversed this year so that corn milling companies can divert some of their excess capacity into ethanol and that could tighten up the market a bit,"" he added.
Ethanol, a gasoline substitute, can also be made by corn millers but the price of gasoline was so low last year that this option was closed. Gasoline prices have averaged 63 cents a gallon so far this year, reaching a peak of 77.01 in April, up from 56 cents a gallon in 1995.
""I think that obviously the world grain situation getting back to more normal levels is encouraging, the re-emergence of ethanol is quite encouraging and the three percent increase in sugar deliveries in the U.S. is quite encouraging,"" said Pillard.
Staley, which produces high fructose corn syrup used as sweeteners in Coca Cola and Pepsi drinks, renegotiates supply contracts with soft drinks firms at the beginning of every calender year. Pillard said it was too early to comment on the next round of contracts.
""It looks like Staley has finally hit the bottom of the cycle,"" said one analyst who declined to be named.
Tate benefited in the last quarter of the year from a recovery in the U.S. sugar market where the selling price of white sugar rose after a low U.S. beet crop reduced supplies.
Cane raw sugar costs declined as supplies of cane raw sugar rose due to increases in the import quota.
North American sweeteners and starches business chipped in 116.2 million pounds in the year ended September 28, down from 170.9 million, as a result of Staley.
European profits rose 8.0 million to 152.5 million pounds, with increased security of supply to Tate's sugars from the new European Union Sugar Regime and progress at Amylum, its European cereal sweetener and starch business.
Trading profit from its emerging markets business was up 6.4 million at 31.5 million. Tate's animal feed and bulk storage business showed a slight profit improvement to 36.8 million.
Tate reported a currency loss of 3.5 million pounds in the year, against a gain of 4.8 million last time, due to sterling's strength against the dollar.

460,"British dairy and distribution company Unigate Plc is keen to acquire food and distribution companies in Europe, said finance director John Worby.
""We are actively seeking acquisitions. We continue to look at acquisitions of all sizes in both the food and distribution area in Western Europe,"" Worby told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday.
""We talk about small, medium and large. Medium is in the area of 50 to 150 million. We will continue to make small acquisitions of the in-fill, bolt-on type nature,"" he said.  
Unigate, which acquired Kraft's European margarine and spreads business in August for some 77 million stg, reported net cash held of 57.9 million at September 30.
The cash outflow for the half year of 110.4 million stg includes 71.4 million spent on acquisitions, net of disposals. The group sold its U.S. restaurant business Black-eyed Pea for 42 million stg in July.
The sale of Taco Bueno and Casa Bonita for 27 million since the half-year stage enables the company to focus on developing its core European food and distribution business.  
The company also sold its minority stake in Dutch food company Nutricia for 360 million stg in January.Cash at the bank and in hand amounted to 292 million at the half-year stage. Worby declined to say whether the company was in talks with any third parties nor would he be drawn on the specific type of acquisition Unigate is after.
At an operational level Worby said he expects the dairy side of the business to continue to suffer from weak commodity prices in the second half of the year. Dairy reported profits down 2.9 million stg at 17.6 million due to lower prices for butter and milk powders which cost Unigate about 4.0 million in the period.  
But from October 1 Unigate has seen a small reduction in raw milk prices, said Worby.
""In fresh foods, trading is still reasonably tough in the UK retail environment. We have seen high pig prices in the first half which squeezed margins but we expect some easing in that area,"" he said.
Unigate's European foods division reported profits up 3.1 million at 44.1 million in the first half, with fresh foods increasing its profits from 20.5 million to 26.5 million stg.
The improvement was especially helped by the contribution from the August acquisition of Kraft's margarines and spreads business.
Malton, the bacon and pork processing business, also benefitted from recent acquisitions.
In the half year a total of 100 million was spent on acquisitions, including 20 million on the Hargrave pork products business to further strengthen Malton and 79 million in buying Kraft's Vitalite and Golden Churn brands to add to St Ivel's existing brands -- Gold and Utterly Butterly.

461,"John McGrath, chief executive of food and drinks giant Grand Metropolitan Plc said the company will continue to unshackle itself from production in its mission to bear down on costs.
""In many cases we don't need to produce what we sell,"" McGrath told Reuters. ""Whether you own the processing is often academic as long as you control the quality.""
The company is looking at further Seneca-type deals in the next year, he said, where a third party takes on the production but GrandMet keeps hold of pricing, marketing and quality.  
Last year, GrandMet contracted out to U.S. company Seneca the processing and packaging of its Green Giant's canned vegetables. Green Giant was acquired as part of Pillsbury, GrandMet's U.S. food arm, in 1989.
Pillsbury currently produces some 75 percent of what it sells and this number will decline in the future.
If a product can be insulated by patent from the competition, then GrandMet would want to continue making it, said McGrath in an interview. But, if it's a bread or biscuit product, for instance, it may make economic sense to allow a third party producer in.  
""We would never get out of distilling whisky or blending... that is a skill which only a few highly skilled people can ensure. They know how to get the right quality, the right taste, the right balance. But, whether you need to bottle it yourself is another matte,"" McGrath said.
""The best example is Coca-Cola who are brand marketeers, brand owner and controllers of the concentrate. But, whether they own the processing is academic as long as they control the quality.""  
McGrath paid tribute to former chairman Lord Sheppard, who stood down as chairman in March, after 21 years with the group, for transforming GrandMet into a leaner, more focused company.
When Sheppard took over in 1987, he found a company with over 30 very different business which he thinned down to three: food, drinks and Burger King retailing.
McGrath, appointed chairman and chief executive of International Distillers and Vintners (IDV), GrandMet's spirits arm, in September 1993, brought a tough, cost-conscious urge to make Sheppard's vision work.  
McGrath, whose management skills stem from the shopfloor and operations rather than boardroom, separates himself from the culture of GrandMet's heady, deal-making days of the last decade when companies were carved up and sold on in droves.
""The view I take which the board strongly supports is concentrating on making those very expensive assets that we have acquired work highly efficiently.""
""Now is the time to concentrate on organic growth very strongly supported by new brand development. We will only make minor acquisitions chiefly in emerging markets or food service in the U.S. where we can get some good returns,"" he said.
""What I am very much concentrating on now is taking all the action we possibly can to as rapidly as possible increase our return on capital,"" said McGrath.
""We are investing for the medium term and no longer for short term gain,"" he said.

473,"Regional brewer Marston, Thompson &amp; Evershad Plc on Tuesday reported an 8.5 percent decline in sales of its key brand ale Marston Pedigree in the first half of the year due to the rising popularity of so-called nitrokegs.
But the ale increased its market share by one percent as its competitors real ales suffered even more. Overall sales of the company's own brewed beers rose 0.5 percent and it launched its own nitrokeg, Marston's Bitter Smoothbrewed, in the Spring.
""Nitrokeg is having quite an effect in terms of market share,"" said chief executive David Gordon in an interview.  
The company's shares were 5p lower at 275p. But the country's two largest brewers -- Scottish &amp; Newcastle and Bass -- who boast a huge portfolio of brands, saw their shares rise.
S&amp;N shares were up 6p at 667p after announcing an unexpectedly strong 26 percent rise in its half year profits on Monday. Unlike traditional beers, nitrokegs do not undergo a secondary fermentation in the cask.  
Brewers have scurried to launch their own nitrokegs after the runaway success of Bass-owned Caffrey's, which sold fast in the scorching 1995 summer.
Caffrey's, served chilled, has taken traditional real ale drinkers away from warmer ales and also attracted premium lager drinkers.
Earlier Marston, Thompson reported a 5.3 percent increase in its pretax profits to 14.7 million stg in the half year ended September 28, driven by strong food and liquor sales in its managed estate.  
Food sales were up by 18.9 percent and now account for 30.8 percent of total sales in its managed pub estate. The company's managed estate of 242 pubs made operating profits of 9.4 million up 12.2 percent.
""There is no evidence that demand is dropping. The average spend per head is seven pounds for food and the retired elderly and the young can afford to do that maybe two or three times a week,"" said Gordon.
""I feel there is a touch more consumer confidence,"" he said, adding conditions were better now than for six or seven years.

Profits in the nine months rose to 2.04 billion pounds ($3.3 billion) from 1.87 billion last time. Profits in the third quarter rose to 714 million from 680 million pounds.
Trading profit from financial services rose by three percent, and profits from tobacco were seven percent ahead.
Overall cigarette sales rose by three percent, although volumes were lower in the United States, a market where total industry sales were flat, the company said.
Chief executive Martin Broughton told a meeting fo share analysts, ""...the dominant issue affecting the share price for B.A.T Industries currently is U.S. litigation, regulation and indeed science.""
The growing pace of litigation claims against the company's U.S. tocacco subsidiary Brown &amp; Williamson, and the U.S. industry in general, continues to unsettle investors and hurt B.A.T's share price.
B.A.T shares have fallen from a high of 585 pence on February 2 to around 434 pence, shedding nearly four billion pounds from the company's stockmarket value along the way.
But Broughton said the company did not see value in demerging the group into separate tobacco and financial services companies.
He told Reuters that a recent strategy review showed ""there was no value we could see that would be generated from a demerger.""
Chairman Lord Cairns said in the results statement that the company had never kept from the public any conclusions showing that smoking causes diseases.
Broughton, responding to a recent paper in Science Magazine in the U.S. which claims a direct link between smoking and lung cancer at cell level, told analysts the company had no internal research which proved that smoking caused lung cancer, or that smoking was addictive.
He said there was still a lack of understanding of the mechanisms of diseases attributed to smoking.
Turning to the business results, B.A.T said the seven percent rise in tobacco trading profit to 1.27 billion pounds was helped by strong sales growth in the Asia Pacific and African, Middle East and Indian subcontinent regions.
In financial servies, B.A.T said its U.S. unit Farmers continued to have an excellent year. In Britain, its Eagle Star insurance division faced fiercely competitive conditions and profits fell to 162 million pounds from 194 million.

478,"Britain's independent brewers on Thursday pressed for a cut in the excise duty on beer ahead of Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke's budget statement on November 26.
The brewers are lobbying hard this time round, after Clarke's previous budget cut the duty on Scotch whisky for the first time since 1895, while leaving the rates on beer and wine unchanged. The duty on beer was raised by 2p a pint in 1994.
""Increasing excise duty over a period...has inevitably increased the divergence with our European partners. The single market demands a single fiscal policy and a uniform excise duty,"" said a letter to the Times newspaper from the chairman of the Independent Family Brewers of Britain.
The letter said the group would deliver a petition to the European parliament, asking for the European Commission to take into account the wide differences in excise duty between EU member states on alcoholic drinks and beer in particular.
The Brewers and Licensed Retailers Association (BLRA) are arguing that a 20 percent cut in the beer duty, equivalent to knocking 6p off a pint, would lower inflation, help boost government revenue and discourage illegal cross-border shopping.
Oxford Economic Forecasting researcher Adrian Cooper used the Treasury's own economic model to argue that a 20 percent cut in beer duty would mean lower inflation, more jobs and in the second year of a duty cut more money for the Exchequer.
British duty on a pint of five percent alcohol by volume is 30 pence. In France, it is just four pence, encouraging people to buy their beer in mainland Europe.
The total volume of duty paid beer flooding into the country is estimated by the BLRA to be about 4-1/2 percent of the total beer market. Over half of this is for illegal resale.
The Scotch Whisky Association estimates the government has received 2.0 million stg more in revenue from the industry as a result of the last cut in the whisky duty. It says the reduction has also fed through into lower prices for consumers.
Before last year's budget, a typical bottle of blended whisky costing 10.70 pounds ($18.01) about 67 percent went in tax, with duty at 5.55 pounds a bottle and value added tax at 1.59 pounds.
Since last year's cut in duty, average prices per bottle have fallen to 9.85 pounds for on supermarket own labels, although the price of brands has risen slightly. The Association is pressing for another four percent off duty paid on a bottle.
Britain's tobacco industry wants a freeze on duty, arguing the government is losing revenue because the tax is so high compared with central Europe, that smuggling is rife.
""We would certainly like to see a freeze this year because we are so far out of sight of the rest of Europe that it's causing a major smuggling problem,"" said Clive Turner, media relations at the Tobacco Council. ""The government is currently missing out on 640 million a year in lost revenue,"" he said.
A 50 gram pack of rolling tobacco normally costs about 7.47 stg in Britain but can be bought in Belguim for slightly under 2.0 stg. The Tobacco Council estimate 68 percent of all hand rolling tobacco sold in Britain comes from mainland Europe and some 62 percent of that is smuggled across.
In his last budget statement Clarke, left the duty paid on hand rolling tabacco unchannged but raised thaty on cigarettes by 15 pence per pack. Cigarettes currently retail for around 2.95 pounds.
In the 1993 budget, Clarke pledged to raise tobacco tax on average by the rate of inflation plus at least three percent in future budgets. Last year's rise was equivalent to the rate of inflation plus seven percent. ($1=.5940 Stg)

479,"Anglo-Dutch food-to-detergent group Unilever Plc, reporting third quarter results next Friday, is likely to have suffered from restructuring costs for its North American industrial cleaning business Diversey and from weak ice cream sales in a drab European summer, analysts said.
Diversey, acquired in January from Molson for 360 million stg, was merged with Lever Industrial in October to form a combined business with annual turnover of 1.15 billion stg and a workforce of 13,000 in 60 different countries.  
Analysts predict third quarter pretax profits in a range of 760 to 820 million, against 786 million stg last time.
The wide range reflects uncertainty about the size of redundancy payments and closures needed to reshape Diversey.
Charges for Diversey could range from 15-30 million stg, with a further 20 million needed for restructuring other Unilever businesses.
But the half-year dividend, paid in the third quarter, is forecast to rise sharply as a result of changes to dividend policy announced at the full year.  
Analysts expect a 10.3p dividend payout under a new policy whereby 35 percent of the previous year's total dividend would be paid in the stronger of either Dutch guilder or sterling so far this year. A 10.3p payout would represent a 46 percent increase on the previous half-year's 7.05p.
For the nine month period analysts are forecasting pretax profits of about 1.9 billion pounds.
""European ice cream sales are not going to have the special benefit they had in 1995 or 1994,"" said John Campbell, analyst at Paribas.  
""European economies are generally weak, and German consumption if anyhing lower because of the tough economic climate there,"" he added.
Michael Bourke at Panmure Gordon saw three factors behind the downturn.
""The exceptional charge will be a bit higher, perhaps about 40 million compared with 20 million the year before, and ice cream sales in the third quarter will have been influenced a lot by the summer weather.""
""Last but not least is the currency factor, with the majority of Unilever profits in US dollars and the recent weakness in the dollar clearly having an impact.""
The consensus forecast EPS for 1996, taken from 24 brokers polled by Reuters, is 84.40p, rising to 92.30p in 1997. Six brokers downgraded their 1996 EPS forecast in October.
Unilever's return on equity is currently running at 27.3 percent, against 66.57 percent for Unigate, the highest in the FTSE all-share food manufacturing sector.
The company's shares reached a high of 1412 pence for the year in mid-September before closing down at 1283 on Friday.

""Conditions have reversed this year so that corn milling companies can divert some of their excess capacity into ethanol and that could tighten up the market a bit,"" he said.
Wet corn miller Staley posted a 50 percent fall in earnings because of a record increase in maize costs, dragging down group pretax profits for the year by some 35 million to 276.3 million.

489,"B.A.T Industries, reporting a nine percent rise in nine-month profits, on Wednesday ruled out a demerger of its tobacco business despite conceding that U.S. tobacco litigation was the main issue affecting its share price.
Chief executive Martin Broughton said the company did not see value in demerging the group into separate tobacco and financial services companies.
A strategy review showed ""there was no value we could see that would be generated from a demerger,"" he told Reuters.
Profits in the nine months rose to 2.04 billion pounds ($3.3 billion) from 1.87 billion last time. Profits in the third quarter rose to 714 million from 680 million pounds.
Trading profit from financial services rose by three percent, and profits from tobacco were seven percent ahead.
Worldwide cigarette sales rose by three percent, although volumes were lower in the United States, a market where total industry sales were flat, the company said.
The growing pace of litigation claims against the company's U.S. cigarette subsidiary Brown &amp; Williamson (B&amp;W), and the U.S. industry in general, continues to unsettle investors and hurt B.A.T's share price.
B.A.T shares have fallen from a high of 585 pence on February 2 to below 430 pence, shedding nearly four billion pounds from the company's stockmarket value along the way.
Broughton said a demerger of Brown &amp; Williamson would be ""highly destructive"" of shareholder value, adding there was ""no question"" that the board of directors was united on the issue.
He also played down fears over U.S. litigation. Only a few cases actually get to court although many are filed, and the company was confident of winning its appeal in the high-profile Carter case, Broughton told a meeting of company analysts.
In the case of Grady Carter, of Orange Park, Florida, a jury in Jacksonville ruled in August that B&amp;W was negligent and made a dangerous and defective product. Carter smoked for 50 years until he was diagnosed with lung cancer.
B.A.T shares have fallen sharply since the Florida court decided to award damages of $750,000 to Carter.
Lawyer Woody Wilner, who acted for Carter in the Florida case, had promised to bring one case a month, but three have been postponed until next year and one dismissed, B.A.T said.
B.A.T was also confident of blocking the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's attempts to bring tobacco regulation into line with drugs and pharmaceuticals, said Broughton.
If the FDA proposals become law, cigarettes will be classified as ""medical devices"" and would have to meet rigorous safety and sales criteria.
Responding to a recent paper in the U.S Science Magazine which claims a direct link between smoking and lung cancer at cell level, Broughton said B.A.T had no internal research which proved smoking caused lung cancer or that smoking was addictive.
""We have not concealed, we do not conceal and we will never conceal,"" he said. There was still a lack of understanding of the mechanisms of diseases attributed to smoking, he added.
Turning to the business results, B.A.T said the seven percent rise in tobacco trading profit to 1.27 billion pounds was helped by strong sales growth in the Asia Pacific and the African, Middle East and Indian subcontinent regions.
In financial servies, B.A.T said its U.S. unit Farmers continued to have an excellent year. In Britain, the Eagle Star insurance division faced fiercely competitive conditions and profits fell to 162 million pounds from 194 million.
It also suffered a 91 million pounds charge for a surge in asbestos and pollution claims in the United States.
The life insurance and investment business reported a five percent increase in profit.

490,"Brewer to leisure group Bass Plc is expected to report a strong improvement in full-year earnings on Wednesday, driven by growth at Holiday Inns and its chain of Harvester restaurants.
""The company will benefit from a full year on its acquisition of Harvester, a full year of sales in Caffrey's and Hoopers Hooch and a full year from Robinsons',"" said BZW analyst Charles Winston. Bass bought the Harvester chain of 78 pubs for 165 million stg from Forte in July.  
Analysts forecasts for pre-tax profits range from 665 to 675 million stg, up from 599.1 million stg in 1995. A dividend of 24.7p is anticipated. The tight profits range bears testimony to the full and detailed trading statement the company announced in September, covering the first 48 weeks of the year.
Chairman Sir Ian Prosser said at the time revenue per available room in the US franchised hotels increased by six percent. Analysts expect revenue per available room to show an increase of 8.0 percent in Europe at the full year.  
""The growth will come from hotels, up 18 percent and pubs up 16 percent,"" said Goldman Sachs analyst Colin Davies.
Analysts expect profits from Holiday Inns to come in at about 193 million stg up from 164 million a year ago. The pubs division, which includes Harvester, is anticipated to show trading profits of some 284 million up from 240 million.
However, trading profit from the leisure division is expected to be down about 10 million at 65 million because of the impact of the national lottery and scratch cards on admissions at Gala, Bass owned traditional bingo clubs.  
But betting shops Coral, also part of the company's leisure division, are likely to see the benefit of government changes in June that allowed betting shop operators to have up to two 10 pound all-cash AWPs on the premises.
The company's brewing business should report a near 10 million stg increase in operating profit to 155 million, helped along by strong sales in the markets leading alcopop Hoopers Hooch and creamy ale Caffrey's.
Profits from the soft drinks division, which includes Britvic, should also be slightly higher -- some analysts predict by as much as 10 million up at 56 million -- as a result of the acquisition of Robinsons' soft drinks business.
Bass shares closed 11p down at 783-1/2p on Friday as talk surfaced that its proposed 200 million stg acquisition of Carlsberg-Tetley would only be allowed through with tough conditions imposed by government.

492,"Britain's largest brewer Scottish and Newcastle Plc announced a 26 percent increase in half-year profits to 195.1 million pounds ($328 million) on Monday and said the second half of the year had started positively.
The company's acquisition of Courage from Australian brewer Fosters last year helped give a 67 percent push to 89.9 million pounds in trading profits from its beer divisions.
""Overall, I think our 10 percent dividend increase, at the top end of the (forecast) range, is a measure of our confidence for the second half of the year,"" chief executive Brian Stewart told Reuters in an interview.
The dividend rise to 7.21 pence per share beat most analysts' forecasts which were centred on a 7p payout.
""General trading conditions are at least as good as they were this time last year and there has been a bit of an improvement in mainland Europe,"" he added.
The company's shares rose 7p to 647p. ""The results were well ahead of our expectations. The really surprising number was the one that came in from beer. We were very impressed,"" said James Wheatcroft, an analyst at Panmure Gordon.
A Reuter poll of analysts produced a forecast range of 178 to 198 million pounds for pretax profits.
Beer sales fell by just over one percent compared with the first half of 1995 which was bolstered by outstanding summer weather, said the company. Despite this, S&amp;N said sales of John Smith's, the country's leading ale, were up 17 percent and sales of Foster's lager grew 6.5 percent to its highest ever volume.
Stewart, however, bemoaned the failure of Chancellor Kenneth Clarke to reduce excise duty on beer in his Budget last week.
Profits from its S&amp;N's Center Parcs activity holiday resorts were down 11 percent at about 44 million pounds due to the weak economic background in mainland Europe and the cost of improving its facilities in the Netherlands and Belgium.
The company sold its smallest village at Lommerbergen, Netherlands, and had to close its De Eemhof parc in Belgium while it upgraded the centre.
""We would expect Center Parcs to be much more on the front foot in the second half and we would quite clearly spell out that conditions in Germany are now more positive,"" said Stewart.
Profits from the company's pubs grew 8.2 percent to 87 million pounds, driven by its managed outlets where like-for-like food sales across the estate grew by 13 percent as the company put more restaurants into its premises.
The company will open 35 new Chef &amp; Brewer pub restaurants by the end of the year and push the Barras &amp; Co community pub brand very strongly, said Stewart.
""We will really be pushing down the accelerator on our community pubs Barras. Our focus has previously been on the high street or city centre and these community pubs really have a great deal of potential,"" he said.
Profits from S&amp;N's tenanted pubs fell some nine percent to 11.8 million pounds after the company was forced to sell off outlets to comply with a government requirement, imposed as a condition of S&amp;N's acquisition of Courage.

497,"British cider group Matthew Clark said on Tuesday fashionable ""alcopop"" drinks had helped to wipe a third off the sales of its premium brands -- Diamond White, K and Babycham -- in the first five months of the financial year.
Matthew Clark has been hit the hardest by a surge in popularity for so-called alcopops -- alcoholic colas and lemonades -- which have proved a success with younger drinkers. Fierce price wars among rival drinks companies have also had ab affect.
Since Matthew Clark stunned the stock market in September with a profit warning that wiped more than 290 million pounds ($466 million) off its market value, investors have badgered the group to explain how it intends to win back sales.
In the long-awaited statement, Matthew Clark conceded that price wars had continued and that sales of draught cider in June and July, were 10 percent lower than during last year's hot summer. Premium brands saw sales slump 30 percent.
The group's draught cider sales were 15 percent down across the whole summer -- although current trading in cider had since stabilised. ""We expect the underlying growth within the cider market as a whole to resume,"" the company said.
But it said it expected to hold its interim dividend at nine pence when it reported half year results ending October 31.
The company's shares closed a sharp 17.5 pence higher at 317.5 pence, although far short of their year high of 804 pence.
""The thing that's made them bounce is they've said they expect to maintain the dividend. But you've got to be cautious because there's no guide as to underlying profit levels,"" said one dealer.
The company has launched a review of its marketing strategy in branded drinks, mainly Diamond White and mainstream ciders Dry Blacthorn and Gaymers Olde English. The key findings will be released in January.
In the meantime, the company said it would create the new position of marketing director, a main board appointment, and take on 40 staff in sales and marketing in its branded drinks division.
Alcopops have proved especially popular with young drinkers, forging major inroads into the British drinks market. In May, research body Euromonitor said it would be worth about 170 million pounds this year after 100 million in 1995.
Leading brands include alcoholic lemonade Hooper's Hooch, owned by Bass, and Two Dogs, marketed by Merrydown.
Drinks industry leaders agreed in January to a voluntary code of practice aimed at limiting the promotion of alcopops after the drinks sparked a storm of controversy over whether they encouraged under-age drinking.
In its last budget, the government imposed a heavy duty on ciders with an alcohol content over 7.5 percent from next year but left alcoholic colas and lemonades unaffected.

502,"Royal Bank of Scotland, which reports full year data next Thursday, is expected to raise its pre-tax profit from last year's 602 million stg but not by as much as analysts thought just a few months ago.
They expect Royal Bank's profits to rise to between 670 and 700 million stg, with a much smaller contribution from its Direct Line low cost insurance, but benefits continuing to accrue from the bank's efforts to reduce costs.
Total dividend is expected to be around 18.6 pence a share versus last year's 16.2p.  
The pre-tax figures will be complicated by an exceptional gain from Royal Bank's disposal of its 50 pct stake in Germany's CC Group, from which it said it would make 70 million stg, and by restructuring costs of around 23 million pounds stemming from an acquisition by its New England subsidiary Citizens.
Forecasts for Direct Line vary widely but analysts are generally pessimistic, with the company's main market -- motor insurance -- going through ""probably the most diffucult period in its history"", as chief executive Ian Chippendale told Reuters in an interview last week.  
""I think Chippendale was sending a strong message,"" said one analyst who declined to be named. ""I think he was softening up the market for a poor set of results.""
Some analysts suspect the results may not be quite as poor as hs been feared by some.
They see the core bank as continuing to perform quite well with the positive results of its ""Project Columbus"" helping costs and income.
David Poutney expects a pre-tax profit of 695 million stg, which includes the exceptional items, while BZW analysts expect 675 million.  
The market received a big clue on the performance of Citizens from the recent results of Bank of Ireland which owns 23 percent of the operation.
""Citizens is doing reasonably well,"" Poutney said, but analysts say it is being affected by the rather lacklustre New England economy.
The market will be expecting improvement in the cost income ratio but analysts say that even an improvement this time will leave the bank plenty of scope for improvement.  
The market will be looking for further clues on lending which showed good growth, mostly in corporate lending area, in the first half.
Inevitably, Royal Bank will also be watched for signs of acquisitions.
It is known to be interested in buying a building society to extend its presence in England but in the current climate, it is unlikely to be willing to pay the high prices likely to be asked.
In any case, analysts say Royal Bank would have to raise cash to be able to perform any major acquisition.  
In the meantime, the market will be looking to its relationship with mutually owned insurance and pensions firm Scottish Widows, which some think may result in an eventual merger.

504,"BZW, the investment banking arm of Barclays Plc, said on Wednesday it plans to use state-of-the-art defence technology to help it with a perennial problem -- managing risk in the financial markets.
The bank has formed the Financial Laboratory Club to develop new risk management solutions, using the scientific and computing potential of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency of the British Ministry of Defence -- the biggest research and development organisation in Western Europe.
Also involved in the project, which has funding of 1.8 million pounds ($3.0 million) for the first two years, are Silicon Graphics, insurance company Royal Sun Alliance, the London Stock Exchange, the City University and Business School and risk management consultancy Z/Yen.
The British government is providing a grant of 750,000 pounds for the project and BZW is putting in 500,000 over two years.
With margins getting ever finer in the highly competitive investment banking world, BZW hopes defence technology can help it keep ahead.
""We have to manage our risk well,"" said Martin Dooney, global head of money markets at BZW. ""We want to start setting the standard and make strides to be ahead of the pack.""
Dooney and DERA scientists believe there is enough common ground between the worlds of the trading room and the battlefield to make the exercise worthwhile.
""The risks are obviously different,"" he said. ""For the crew of a main battle tank it could be the missile defences of the opposing force and for the bond trader it could be the movement of short-term interest rates.""
But Dooney said there are many similarities, not least the fact that that both are high-stress environments which both require the sophisticated modelling and simulation techniques which have, until now, been largely the preserve of the defence industries.
One reason for this is that research into this field needs massive computing power which DERA can provide via its four Cray Computer Corp super-computers which are millions of times more powerful than the average desktop PC.
BZW believes the project can help people at every level in the company to better understand the firm's risk position by replacing a mass of numbers by visualisation techniques.
The project will also look into using modelling techniques used to develop military consoles to look at the design of future trading stations and try to develop different ways of evaluating dealer performance.
This will, in particular, provide early warning of problems based on trading pattern evidence.
""The financial services industry wants something that it can use in the heat of battle,"" said Michael Mainelli, development director at DERA.
""If financial markets are destabilised they could be as, or even more, damaging than a conventional war.""

506,"The London High Court on Thursday adjourned a hearing to decide whether British authorities will hand over to Italy documents related to the business affairs of Italian media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi.
The judge decided the hearing could not be finished in the two days allotted and lawyers would have to return in the first week of October before two new judges.
Britain's Serious Fraud office (SFO) seized the documents -- 15 bags full -- earlier this year from London lawyer David Mills who represents the business interests of former Italian Prime Minister Berlusconi, who, among other things, owns three TV channels and the football club AC Milan.
An SFO statement after the adjournment said: ""We regret that the court has not been able to hear this matter, particularly as it is now nearly five months since the documents were seized.""
The hearing stemmed from an appeal by Berlusconi and his company Fininvest and others against a decision that the papers be handed over to Italian magistrates.
An earlier court hearing was told the papers were linked to fraud and false accounting allegations amounting to 41 million pounds ($64.33 million) at overseas companies which were moved from Switzerland to England.
Italian investigators suspect Berlusconi's Fininvest may have used offshore companies to channel payments to politicians.
Berlusconi is on trial in Milan for alleged complicity in bribing tax officials for lenient audits of Fininvest companies.
The tycoon, who leads the centre-right Freedom Alliance, has also been indicted in another case in which he is charged with illegal party funding.
In court on Thursday, a lawyer for the appellants told the judge the SFO had allowed Italian police too much time to see the documents before a decision was made on whether to send them officially to Italy.
She also alleged that the Italian government's request for documents was too wide and amounted to a ""fishing expedition"", which is not allowed under British law.

515,"Britain's Woolwich Building Society on Monday set the timetable for a three billion pounds ($5.1 billion) stock market flotation in July which will bring an average windfall of over 1,200 pounds to its members.
The mutually-owned building society, the third largest in the country with assets of more than 30 billion pounds, said qualifying customers would receive at least 450 free shares upon its conversion to public limited company (Plc) status.
The Woolwich said it expected a basic distribution of 450 free shares to around 2.57 million people, which includes qualifying employees and qualifying pensioners.
Chief executive John Stewart said the Woolwich would be among Britain's top 10 banks and would be included in the FT-SE 100 index of blue-chip shares.
""(The conversion and flotation) will give the Woolwich a corporate structure which will allow it to meet its strategic objectives by remaining an independent provider of a wide range of personal financial services,"" Stewart added.
The Woolwich said its financial advisers, investment banks Schroders and BZW, have made an historic valuation that puts its market capitalisation at between 2.96 and 3.38 billion pounds with a mid value of 3.17 billion had the conversion happened on December 20, 1996.
This represents a range of price per share of between 175 and 200 pence with a mid-price of 187.5 pence and is at the top end of market expectations, analysts said.
Rob Thomas, building society analyst at UBS, said the eventual flotation price was likely to use the fairly strong performance of Abbey National Plc, the only other building society to have floated, as a benchmark.
The Woolwich is one of four building societies -- traditionally mainly mortgage lenders but now expanding their role -- which plan stock market flotations in 1997.
They are led by Britain's largest mortgage lender, the Halifax, which is expected to be valued at around 10 billion pounds, the Alliance &amp; Leicester worth around 2.5 billion and the Northern Rock, which is expected to raise around one billion pounds.
The Woolwich will be protected from takeover for five years after flotation but, if proposed legislation goes through this year, it would lose protection if it buys a financial company or if 75 percent of its shareholders vote to waive it.
Banking analysts said the Woolwich would have to weigh up the pros and cons of losing its protected status. But to compete effectively in a congested market it would have to grow, especially in the life assurance and independent financial advice areas.
""The Woolwich may decide that the 75 percent rule still makes it very vulnerable and the best chance for long-term survival is to grow through acquisitions,"" Thomas said.
Stewart became chief executive last June after his predecessor Peter Robinson, architect of the flotation strategy, left amid allegations that he ""misused the facilities"" of the group, where he had worked for more than 30 years.
Stewart at once identified life insurance and fund management as gaps in the Woolwich armoury. He has ruled out a move into commercial or investment banking, stressing that the bank will specialise in personal financial services.
The Woolwich said the average distribution to members, including a variable element, would be 1,233 pounds, although the exact distribution would depend on how much people have in their accounts on the qualifying dates.
An additional handout of up to 2,000 free shares will be made to savers who have been with the society for more than two years.

Forsyth, 60, who is also appealing against the money-laundering conviction itself, described her 10 months in prison as an ""experience"".
""I would just like to thank the court for its understanding and consideration,"" Forsyth told reporters as she was freed from the cells of London's Royal Courts of Justice.
Forsyth, who was chairman of South Audley Management, a firm set up by Turkish Cypriot Nadir to deal with his wealthy family interests before his Polly Peck empire collapsed in 1990 under a mountain of debt, said she could not comment further on the appeal as it was still continuing.
Earlier, the appeal judges surprised the court by making it clear at once that Forsyth would not be returning to spend another night at Holloway prison.
""We have formed a view that this sentence cannot stand,"" Lord Justice Beldam said at the outset of the appeal hearing, adding that the sentence was so disproportionate that, ""taking into account the time she has already served...she should not serve any longer.""
Beldam, hearing the appeal with two other judges, then moved on to consider Forsyth's appeal against her conviction on two counts of dishonestly handling 400,000 pounds ($650,000) of stolen funds.
Forsyth's lawyer, Geoffrey Robertson, later made a bail application so that Forsyth could be freed pending the outcome of the rest of the appeal.
At the end of the court session, Forsyth told reporters she was heading for her mother's home.
""I'm looking forward to going home...and it won't be an iron bed with a thin mattress,"" she said, adding that her son was arrving for a family reunion.
She said of her time in prison, ""I learnt an awful lot, it was an education process."" She took up art in prison and was a library orderly.
Asked if she bore any grudges against the legal system, she said: ""There's a lot wrong with the system. The prison officers work very hard to do a difficult job under difficult circumstances.""
Forsyth has been in prison since March 1996 when Justice Sir Richard Tucker surprised those following the case with the severity of his sentence.
During her five-week trial, the jury accepted that Forsyth had helped to launder money that had been stolen from Polly Peck by Nadir.
Nadir still faces charges connected to Polly Peck but in 1993 he fled to northern Cyprus, a territory not recognised by the British government, skipping 3.5 million pounds ($5.67 million) bail.

527,"Anglo-French Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel Monday announced a deal giving its creditor banks 45.5 percent of the company in return for wiping out one billion pounds ($1.56 billion) of its debt.
The long-awaited restructuring brings to an end months of wrangling between Eurotunnel and the 225 banks to which it owes nearly nine billion pounds ($14.1 billion).
The deal, announced simultaneously in Paris and London, brings the company back from the brink of insolvency but leaves shareholders owning only 54.5 percent of the company.
""The restructuring plan provides Eurotunnel with the medium-term financial stability to allow it to consolidate its substantial commercial achievements to date and to develop its operations,"" Eurotunnel co-chairman Alastair Morton said.
The firm was now making a profit before interest, he added.
Although shareholders will see their interests diluted, they were offered the prospect of a brighter future after months of uncertainty while Eurotunnel wrestled to reduce crippling interest payments negotiated during the tunnel's construction.
Eurotunnel, which has taken around half the cross-Channel market from the European ferry companies, said a strong operating performance could allow it to pay its first dividend within the next 10 years.
French co-chairman Patrick Ponsolle said shareholders would have to be patient before they could reap the benefits of the company's success.
He called the debt restructuring plan ""an acceptable compromise"" for holders of Eurotunnel shares.
The company said there was still considerable work to be done to finalise and agree on the details of the plan before it can be submitted to shareholders and the full 225 bank syndicate for approval, probably early in 1997.
Monday's announcement followed two weeks of highly secretive negotiations between Eurotunnel and its six leading banks. This was extended to the 24 ""instructing banks"" at a meeting late last week in London.
Eurotunnel said the debt-for-equity swap would be at 130 pence, or 10.40 francs, per share. That is considerably below the level of around 160 pence widely reported before announcement of the deal, and will reduce outstanding debt of 8.7 billion pounds ($13.6 billion) by 1.0 billion ($1.56 billion).
The company said a further 3.7 billion pounds ($5.8 billion) of debt would be converted into new financial instruments and existing shareholders would be able to participate in this issue.
If they choose not to take up free warrants entitling them to subscribe to this, Eurotunnel said shareholders' interests may be reduced further to just over 39 percent of the company by the end of December 2003.
Eurotunnel's shares, which were suspended last week at 113.5 pence ahead of Monday's announcement, should resume trading on Tuesday, the company said.

""Reinstatement doesn't seem very likely,"" she told Reuters.
Horlick is waging a campaign for reinstatement or compensation from the firm from which she resigned in a blaze of publicity last week after allegations that she planned to defect and poach some of her colleagues.
But so far MGAM, and its parent company Deutsche Morgan Grenfell (DMG), have remained deaf to her pleas.
Horlick met her lawyer John Farr of law firm Herbert Smith again on Tuesday and although her advisers hinted it was far too early to talk of legal action against DMG, this has not been ruled out by Horlick's camp.
The advisers indicated an early resolution of the dispute was unlikely and could take several weeks as Deutsche and MGAM had still to complete an internal inquiry into the affair.
""It will take several days, if not weeks, I should think,"" one adviser said.
Despite indications that discussions took place on Tuesday between Farr and DMG's legal representatives, a DMG spokesman denied there had been further contact.
The bank is sticking firmly to its guns in the row with the 35-year-old mother of five, one of London's most prominent fund managers.
It says Horlick, having been promoted to the rank of managing director, was suspended just days later for ""soliciting staff"" to join a rival firm and then resigned her position.
The plot has thickened amid unconfirmed allegations that this was a prelude to a takeover of MGAM's pension fund business by Dutch bank ABN AMRO.
ABN AMRO declined to comment on the latest reports but has already denied having tried to poach Horlick and her team.
On Tuesday, however, the Dutch bank acknowledged it would be interested in buying a large British fund manager and its global asset management director Jan Vroegop told Reuters it would like to make ""big steps"" in London funds management.
Horlick continues to deny allegations that she was leading a breakaway group.
DMG's line is that Horlick will not be reinstated and that there will be no compensation because she had resigned. DMG's parent Deutsche Bank also said late Monday that it did not expect to go to court with Horlick.
Deutsche board member Rolf Breuer, who is poised to take over the helm of Deutsche in May from Hilmar Kopper, said: ""The facts are clear. Mrs Horlick inflicted damage on the bank with her attempt to poach staff and then resigned.""
Meanwhile, differing versions of what led up to her suspension continued to trickle out.
British newspaper reports said ABN AMRO was involved with Horlick in planning to fund a management buyout of the 18 billion pounds ($30 billion) pension fund business which Horlick headed.
They said ABN ARMO planned to recruit Horlick and her team and then to offer to buy the residue from Morgan Grenfell for a reported 385 million pounds.
Horlick's colleagues were reported to have been unconvinced by the merits of ABN's alleged plan to poach the team, not least because one of the team's key aims had been to have Horlick promoted to a more influential position within MGAM. Once this happened it removed a key complaint against top management.
MGAM has had a troubled time since the sacking of fund manager Peter Young last September after irregularities came to light in three of the group's funds, hitting staff morale and also rattling clients.
Young has denied any criminal activity and is being investigated by Britain's Serious Fraud Office.
So far no clients have withdrawn their business from MGAM as a result of the Horlick affair. However, several major clients have expressed their concern and said they would be reviewing their relationship with the firm. ($1=.6021 Pound)

546,"Fund management Group Mercury Asset management will make acquisitions if it can enhance shareholder value, its chairman Hugh Stevenson said on Tuesday after announcing bumper profits and a sharp jump in its cash pile.
Profits rose 29 percent to 81.8 million stg from 63.6 million stg in the first half last year while cash rose to 261.6 million stg from 189.9 million at the end of March.  
Asked if MAM was considering a U.S. acquisition, Stevenson said: ""The U.S. is obviously an extremely important market, it's the biggest savings market in the world but value for our shareholders is the main aim.""
Stevenson said an acquisition which enhanced this value would have to be considered.
On the cash pile, Stevenson said that the company prefers a conservative balance sheet.
""Cash has risen materially in the last six months,"" Stevenson said.  
""It's a question of a balance between a prudent balance sheet and returning value in the form of dividends to shareholders. We've had a very progressive dividend policy over recent years.""
Stevenson said the rise in the interim dividend to 10 pence per share from six pence last time reflected a desire to rebalance the interim and final payout.
He was unsure if this rebalancing was complete given the uncertainty of how the full year will turn out.  
Stevenson refused to comment on the state of world equity markets and thus the company's prospects for the second half, ""We tend to reserve comments on the markets for our clients.""
But in a statement earlier, he said the firm was determined to create value through profitable expansion notwithstanding short-term market movements.
MAM again showed that it is not missing its tie to former owner S.G. Warburg which was cut when the latter was gobbled up by Swiss Bank Corp last year.  
Stevenson said the first half had been positive with funds under management rising to 85.9 billion stg from 70.9 billion at the same point last year and 81 billion at the end of March.
The current figure included 2.0 billion stg of net new business which was lower than the 2.5 billion stg seen in the second half of last year.
He said it was too early to tell what effect problems at Morgan Grenfell Asset Management, where alleged irregularities are being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office, might have on the industry in the longer term.
""It's a growth industry,"" Stevenson said, ""and it continues to grow. The UK market is changing and we have been doing more in defined contribution business.""
About two thirds of MAM's business is in the institutional pension fund management area, 20 percent for investors overseas and the rest for private investors.
Costs continued to rise but were more than matched by revenue growth.
Stevenon said the rise reflected the consolidation of its Australian subsidiary; large investment in systems and infrastructure; and the coyly termed ""higher provision for variable remuneration"", otherwise known as bonuses. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 8864.

550,"Mercantile Bancorp Inc would likely remain a potential target in the Missouri bank merger wave after its planned combination with Mark Twain Bancshares Inc.
""This certainly doesn't mean that Mercantile is no longer a buyout candidate,"" said Michael Ancell, analyst at Edward D. Jones &amp; Co. ""It's clear that the bank merger wave has rolled into St. Louis and it's turning into a tsunami.""  
As the largest bank holding company in Missouri behind Boatmen's Bancshares Inc, Mercantile is seen by analysts as attractive to banks looking to establish a presence in the lower Midwest.
In August, NationsBank Corp agreed to buy Boatmen's Bancshares Inc for $9.5 billion.
That deal valued Boatmen's at a pricey 2.7 times book value, analysts said. Mercantile's deal values Mark Twain at about 2.8 times book value, analysts said. The pooling of interests deal is worth $49.62 a share to Mark Twain shareholders, based on Friday's closing price, the banks said.  
The St. Louis-based bank holding companies would have a combined total of $21.3 billion in assets.
""It's a pretty pricey transaction,"" said James Schutz, banking analyst at Chicago Corp. ""Mark Twain is a very profitable and a very attractive franchise.""
Mark Twain reported return on average assets of 1.82 percent in the third quarter and return on average realized common equity of 18.49 percent, putting it in the upper echelon of Midwest banks, analysts said.  
""It's an in-market deal, which allows for a tremendous ammount of efficiencies, which is good for Mercantile,"" said Joseph Steiven, analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. ""They're paying full-boat prices, but they're getting an excellent company.""
But Schutz noted that Mark Twain already operates efficiently, and questioned how much more in efficiency Mercantile could wring out of Mark Twain.
""The question I would ask is how is Mercantile going to earn back this premium they're paying,"" Schutz said.  
That question appeared to be in the market Monday, with Mercantile shares down 2-3/8 at 49-3/4 and Mark Twain up 3-5/8 to 46.
Mark Twain chief executive John Dubinsky, who is slated to become chief executive of Mercantile's St. Louis bank when the deal is completed, indicated there were not likely to be wholesale job cuts when the two banks combine.
""Between Mercantile and Mark Twain as we sit here today, there are over 200 job openings,"" Dubinsky said in an interview. ""There will be some duplications, there will be some consolidation of job functions.""
But ""quality"" individuals whose jobs are eliminated because of duplication will be able to apply for other jobs, he said, noting ""I would be very surprised if there was a large number of individuals that won't be needed.""
Dubinsky also would not rule out the possibility of the combined Mercantile/Mark Twain being acquired.
""Banking is changing so rapidly,"" he said. ""One couldn't make any comment with certainty about the future.""

551,"Mercantile Bancorp Inc's planned $1.07 billion purchase price for Roosevelt Financial Group Inc and an expected merger-related charge of $25-$30 million after tax both appear reasonable for an in-market deal, analysts said Monday.
The St. Louis-based bank holding company said it expects to take the charge in the quarter the deal closes.
""For a deal this size, I think, it's probably relatively modest,"" analyst Steve Schroll at Piper Jaffray said.  
Roosevelt, a $9 billion thrift holding company also located in St. Louis, has 83 branches, 73 of which overlap with Mercantile, Schroll said.
The banks told analysts they expect to eliminate 50 of the overlapping branches by the middle of 1998, he said, adding that Mercantile also expects to cut 37 percent of Roosevelt's pre-tax cost base by 1999.
In a news conference, Mercantile would not specifically say how many branches would be shut.  
The cost reductions help justify the $1.07 billion price tag, which is about 11 times 1997 earnings estimates for Roosevelt, Schroll said.
""It's reasonable,"" Schroll said. ""For an in-market deal, because of the opportunities to save costs, it's reasonable.""
With its recently announced plan to acquire Mark Twain Bancshares Inc for $855 million, Mercantile will be the largest financial institution in Missouri, with $30 billion in assets once both deals close.
That could make Mercantile, often mentioned as a takeover candidate, even more attractive.  
""I'd say Merc was already attractive anyway,"" said Joseph Stieven, a banking analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, which advised Roosevelt on the deal. ""This makes them no less attractive.""
Joseph Roberto, a banking analyst at Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods, said, ""I think it makes Mercantile more attractive. It gives them the number one market share across the state.""
But the process of closing the two deals, expected in the second quarter, and absorbing the acquisitions could take Mercantile out of play as an acquisition target in the short term, analysts said.
""I would think in the short term, an acquisition of this size, when combined with the acquisition of Mark Twain, probably delays the likelihood of somebody from outside coming in to buy Mercantile,"" Schroll said.
Meanwhile, St. Louis-based Magna Group Inc and Kansas City, Missouri-based Commerce Bancshares Inc could become more attractive for suitors looking to buy in the Missouri market, analysts said.

555,"Dayton Hudson Corp., the nation's fourth-largest retailer, Tuesday reported higher third-quarter results, giving added credence to analysts' projections of an industrywide strong holiday shopping season.
Women's retail chains Ann Taylor and The Limited also posted higher results.
General merchandise retailers should post decent gains in November and December combined, said Howard Eilenberg, an analyst at Johnson Redbook Service, a unit of Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan Inc.
""It's going to be overall in the 5-to-5-1/2 percent increase range (over the previous year's sales). More importantly, the gross margins and the profits are going to look better,"" Eilenberg said.
Dayton Hudson said it had a 164 percent increase in operating earnings for its third quarter ended Nov. 2. Results were aided by a strong performance at its Target discount stores.
The Minneapolis-based retailer reported operating earnings of $116 million, or 49 cents a share, several cents above analysts' estimates. A year earlier it earned $44 million, or 18 cents a share.
""The key issue was a very strong performance from Target in all areas,"" said Saul Yaari, retail analyst at Piper Jaffray.
Target's operating profit in the third quarter rose 82 percent to $213 million, and total revenues increased 14 percent while same-store revenues rose 5 percent, Dayton Hudson said.
Meanwhile, Dayton Hudson's Mervyn's unit reported a 98 percent increase in operating profits to $64 million in the quarter, boosted by reductions in marketing costs, store expenses and headquarters costs. The increase came despite a 3 percent drop in revenue and a decrease in gross margins.
""Our third-quarter results reflect continued strong profit performance at Target and Mervyn's,"" Dayton Hudson Chairman Bob Ulrich said in a news release. ""While the holiday calendar is challenging, we believe we are well positioned for a successful finish to 1996.""
The 1996 holiday season includes five fewer selling days between Thanskgiving and Christmas than a year ago.
New York-based AnnTaylor Stores Corp. reported net income of $3.3 million, or 13 cents a share, after a $2 million, or 8-cent-a-share after-tax charge related to obligations under its former chairman's contract. That compared with $666,000, or 3 cents a share, a year ago.
Columbus, Ohio-based Limited Inc. reported operating earnings of $88.4 million, or 15 cents a share, before gains from initial public offerings, compared with $69.1 million, or 10 cents a share, a year ago.
""Our much improved third-quarter results reflect performance gains and continuing momentum in certain of our women's and our emerging businesses"" including the Abercrombie &amp; Fitch business, Limited Chief Executive Leslie Wexner said in a statement.
""Consistent with our sales plan, we enter the holiday period well positioned, with overall inventories up 3 percent per square foot at retail,"" he said.
Analysts agreed The Limited was well positioned for the key holiday shopping season.
""I think they're positioned for a decent Christmas,"" said Elizabeth Pierce, analyst at Stephens Inc. ""Inventories are conservatively managed.""
Dayton Hudson stock rose $1.25 to $37.625, Limited rose 25 cents to $17.75 and AnnTaylor fell 87.5 cents to $20.50, all on the New York Stock Exchange.

557,"Caterpillar Inc chief financial officer Douglas Oberhelman said Tuesday that an increase in U.S. dealer new machine inventories at the end of 1996 was intentional.
""It's higher than it was a year ago and that's by design,"" Olberhelman said in an interview with Reuters. ""As it turned out last year, we didn't have enough inventory in dealer hands and this year we will, we hope,"" he said.
Some analysts expressed concern Tuesday at the increase in inventories.  
The Peoria, Illinois-based heavy equipment maker Tuesday reported record net income of $381 million or $1.99 a share for the fourth quarter, up from $300 million or $1.53 a share a year ago and $0.11 ahead of consensus estimates.
But the company's outlook that the 1997 profit level would ""approximate"" that of 1996 appeared to be pushing the stock lower Tuesday.
Oberhelman defended the company's view of slowing U.S. economic growth in the face of analysts' comments that the view was too conservative.  
""We're trying to call it as we see it,"" he said. ""I will tell you that a year ago, we called for a softer economy in the U.S. and it didn't happen. We were pleasantly surprised.""
He added that the company is prepared to increase production if demand is stronger than expected, as it did in 1996.
After focusing the last several years on improving operations, Oberhelman said the company now thinks it's time to increase spending on research and development and on capital assets to improve shareholder value in the future.  
Total capital expenditures were $642 million in 1996 and are expected to rise 10 to 15 percent in 1997, while research and development is expected to rise 20 percent from the $410 million spent in 1996, Caterpillar said.
""It's going to be a little bit of everything,"" he said when asked if the expenditures would be focused on acquisition or internal development.
He said the company is likely to continue its pace of about 50 new or upgraded product introductions a year through 1999.
One area the company is looking to gain in is power generation equipment, a $5 billion worldwide market Caterpillar sees tripling in the next several years.
""We'll still be building there, both internally and through acquisitions,"" he said.
Caterpillar shares were down 1-3/4 at 76-3/4 Tuesday.

560,"Sears, Roebuck and Co. Thursday said earnings jumped 24.6 percent in the fourth quarter, boosted by strong sales and improved profit margins during the Christmas selling season.
""We ended the year with excellent fourth-quarter results, which are even more impressive given the strength of last year's fourth quarter,"" Sears Chairman Arthur Martinez said in a statement.
December included the company's first ever back-to-back billion-dollar sales weeks, he said. The Christmas season is crucial for retailers since store chains typically earn half or more of their annual profit during the period.
""They had a great 1996 capped off by the best Christmas of any department store operator,"" said Alan Rifkin, analyst at Dain Bosworth Inc. He noted that Sears' sales at comparable stores rose 9.5 percent in December.
The nation's second-largest retailer said earnings rose to $567 million, or $1.42 a share, in the quarter, from $455 million,  or $1.13 a share, in the 1995 period. Sales grew 10.8 percent to $12.04 billion from $10.87 billion.
The earnings beat Wall Street forecasts that averaged $1.38 a share, according to First Call, which tracks estimates.
But Sears' stock fell $2 to $49.125 on the New York Stock Exchange, mostly on profit-taking.
""The stock was up strongly early in the week and I think people are just taking profits,"" Rifkin said.
Analysts said Sears gained from its decision to remodel some stores and expand its clothing offerings.
""Clearly they're gaining market share and clearly they're doing the right thing and the consumer likes what she sees when she goes into the store,"" said Karen Sack, analyst at the S&amp;P Equity Group.
Operating income from domestic operations rose 14.8 percent to $531 million in the quarter as revenue rose 11.6 percent to $10.92 billion. Comparable-store sales rose 5.4 percent for the quarter.
Operating income from domestic operations for all of 1996 rose 20.9 percent to $1.28 billion, while revenues increased 10.2 percent to $34.85 billion.
Gross margins as a percent of merchandise sales rose to 27.9 percent from 26.9 percent in the 1995 period.
Rifkin said margins were not likely to rise as much in 1997 as in the fourth quarter, but said cost-cutting should drive earnings growth this year.
He forecast earnings at $3.60 a share in 1997 and $4.25 a share in 1998, up from $3.12 a share in 1996.
International operations, including merchandising and credit operations in Canada and Mexico, earned $36 million in the quarter, compared with a loss of $7 million in the 1995 period.
The increase in earnings was largely attributable to improved performance at both Sears Canada and Sears Mexico, lower selling and administrative expenses at Sears Mexico, and writeoffs of Sears Canada properties in the year-ago quarter, it said.
Sears, based in Hoffman Estates, Ill., operates more than 800 department stores and 2,500 other stores offering clothing, home and automotive products and services.
While earnings rose in the quarter, they fell for the year, in part because 1995 included a gain of $776 million from the former Allstate Corp. subsidiary, which was spun off to Sears' shareholders in June 1995.
For all of 1996, Sears earned $1.27 billion, or $3.12 a share, in net profits, down from $1.80 billion, or $4.50 a share, in 1995. Sales grew 9 percent to $38.22 billion from $35.0 billion.

566,"A brisk start to holiday shopping should help retailers post solid sales gains for November and make this season merrier than last year for the nation's store chains, industry analysts said Tuesday.
But quirks in the calendar, with a later Thanksgiving this year, and some retailers tallying sales differently than others, could obscure overall results for November.
Industry analysts said they expect sales at stores open at least a year to rise 2.5 percent to 4.0 percent overall in November, with clothing continuing to be a strong contributor, as it was in October.
Most retailers report November sales on Thursday, though Paul Harris Stores Inc., a speciality women's apparel chain, reported November same-store sales up 26 percent from a year ago on Tuesday.
""We think the majority of companies are going to be on or above plan for the month of November, with good inventory levels,"" said Harry Ikenson, retail analyst at Rodman &amp; Renshaw Inc. ""We think the promotional level for Thanksgiving was high, but probably no higher than last year.""
With discounts and markdowns no higher and in some cases lower than last year, and inventories being managed tightly, profit margins should improve, helping to lift fourth quarter earnings, analysts said.
""On balance, good business now is going to translate into decent earnings,"" said Dean Ramos at Dain Bosworth Inc. Ramos said his index of sales could be one to two points higher than the 3.1 percent rise reported last year and that the trend should continue through December.
""Absent some sort of event that shakes the consumer you should see good retail sales"" in December, he said.
Holiday sales are crucial to retailers who typically earn a quarter or more of the year's profits during the season, analysts said. Steady economic growth and low unemployment have helped boost sales so far, and store chains should also benefit from easy comparisons with weak results a year ago.
Consumers got off to a fast start on their holiday shopping after Thanksgiving, analysts said.
Retail consumer spending in the post-Thanksgiving weekend rose 4.3 percent from a year ago, according to TeleCheck Services, which tracks check-writing volume. Overall, same-store sales rose 2.1 percent, TeleCheck said.
Several department store operators were expcted to be among the winners when sales are reported on Thursday.
Rodman &amp; Renshaw's Ikenson said he expected J.C. Penney Co. Inc. and May Department Stores Co. to be above expectations, with Penney's same-store sales up 7.5 percent to 8 percent and May's up 6 percent to 7 percent. Federated Department Stores Inc. should be up 7 percent to 9 percent, with gains in all its segments, he said.
Ikenson said he sees Charming Shoppes Inc. slightly below expectations with a gain of 5 percent.
Dean Witter analyst Patrick McCormack said in a research report he expected sames store sales to be up 3 percent in the month for the firm's index of 44 companies.
He also saw JC Penney, May, and Federated above expectations, as well as Sears, Roebuck and Co.
Sears was forecast by analysts to post a smaller-than-expected decline of 1 percent to 2 percent, which is due to a quirk in the company's sales reporting calendar that should help boost results in December.
Sears Senior Executive Vice President John Costello said on Sunday that post-Thanskgiving sales appeared to be up across the board, from men's and children's clothing to Craftsman tools to fine jewelry.
""Optimism is up and it looks like consumers are responding to the short season by getting an earlier start,"" he said.
Most analyts expect big-ticket consumer electronics to continue to be weak, though one saw some signs of a pickup in sales at the end of the month.
""Sears and Wal-Mart over the last week talked about a pickup in the computer area,"" said Michael Niemira, analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. He forecast sales overall up 2.5 percent for November at a comparable number of stores.

570,"Most banks in the U.S. Midwest are expected to post third quarter earnings gains of 10 percent or more as the strong economy continues to generate loan growth, cost-cutting programs show results and credit quality remains reasonably sound.
""It looks like credit quality trends should hold up very well,"" said Michael Ancell, banking analyst at Edward D. Jones. He expects the banks he follows to have average earnings gains of 11 percent.  
For most of the year, analysts who follow banks have been waiting to see deterioration in credit quality, especially in credit card loans.
But while some banks, like First Chicago NBD, showed a higher charge-off rate in credit card receivables in the second quarter, a wider wave of loan quality problems has yet to appear, analysts said.
""I don't see large increases in (loan loss) provision,"" said James Schutz, banking analyst at Chicago Corp.  
Many banks have also been aggressively cutting costs, which should help third quarter results. Analysts pointed to Milwaukee-based Firstar Corp as one bank that could benefit from an aggressive cost-cutting plan.
Others point to banks that have been generating fee revenue, such as Northern Trust Corp and Norwest Corp, as also primed for strong gains.  
""Most people are working very hard at expense controls,"" said Thomas Maier, banking analyst at EVEREN Securities. ""I'm more in mind at looking more favorably at those banks that are strong revenue growers. Ultimately, you've got to sell product, in any business.""
Another factor helping gains in earnings per share is stock buyback programs, with many banks aggressively repurchasing their stock. First Bank System Inc, which announced a plan earlier this year to repurchase 25 million shares, was seen by analysts as one of the most aggressive on this front.  
Meanwhile, analysts said the 10 percent pace of earnings gains should continue into next year.
""Even though the credit quality cycle is not getting any better, it certainly is not getting any worse at any kind of a rapid pace,"" said Ben Crabtree, analyst at Dain Bosworth.

581,"Retailers looking for a post-Christmas rush to boost lukewarm holiday sales may be disappointed as snow in some areas and holiday exhaustion kept many shoppers from bargain-hunting Thursday.
""I think people did their shopping"" before Christmas, said John Konarski, vice president at the International Council of Shopping Centers, a group of retail mall operators that surveys 85 large regional malls across the country.
""You're going to have some people out today (but) you're not going to see the massive crowds some people expected.""
Konarski said he expected that holiday season sales would be up 4 percent to 6 percent from a year ago, which is about what he expected before the season began.
But after strong activity in the weekend following Thanksgiving, retailers' hopes for even better sales ended up being dashed by a slowdown in the week before Christmas.
""I think generally, the overall picture appears to be we had a good, solid holiday sales period, but not a spectacular one,"" said Tracy Mullin, president of the National Retail Federation, which represents major store chains.
She said she expects holiday sales rose about 5 percent from last year, when gains were a weak 2.5 percent to 3 percent.
Store officials and analysts said that while sales were coming in at or just below retailers' expectations, that still beats the dismal results last year.
""They slowed up very moderately, actually, from the input we're getting,"" said Jay Meltzer, managing director of LJR Redbook Research. ""You know, we didn't go over a cliff and a year ago we did go over a cliff.""
In Chicago, snow and cold weather appeared to be keeping crowds down in the Michigan Avenue shopping district the day after Christmas.
""Sales today are relatively slow compared to before Christmas,"" said Julie Towson, manager of the Knot Crazy tie store in Water Tower Place. ""I think a lot of people spent all of their money before the holiday. Also, who wants to come out in this kind of weather?""
In central New York State, where it was also snowing, Konarski said there were lines at malls before stores opened at 7 a.m. EST (1200 GMT), but most shoppers were looking for markdowns on holiday accessories and to return merchandise.
In Cleveland, many workers were on vacation and some offices were closed, and shopper traffic at the Tower City Center mall complex was moderate.
""We've had a good, strong season,"" said the manager of a women's clothing store who has worked in retailing 11 years. ""Business today is pretty good. Volume is moderate.""
At Tower City's AnnTaylor store, sales associate Mary Rogonjich said Thursday morning traffic was slow but she expected things to pick up during lunch hour.
""Things have been steady this morning, and we have not had that many returns,"" she said. ""We've had a very good season -- above plan."" The store was offering up to 50 percent off on silk blouses, pants, jackets, shoes and other items on Thursday.
In Miami, some shops were seeing more traffic.
""The store is very busy. Really everything is marked down,"" said a spokeswoman at Federated Department Stores Inc.'s Macy's store in Miami's Falls mall.
But analysts said that while promotions picked up before Christmas and would accelerate this week, special discounts were fewer and less steep than last year, which should help retailer profits.
""Some retailers did get promotional in the last few days,"" Mullin said. ""I think you'll see it really starting today.""
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's largest retailer, said in a telephone message for investors on Monday that discount and warehouse sales were at the low end of plan for the holidays in the third week of December.
The company is in line for sales increases of 4 percent to 5 percent for November and December, the company said.
Dayton Hudson Corp. said on Tuesday sales were meeting expectations and that the company had planned its inventories well.
Sears, Roebuck and Co. said overall sales and sales at stores open at least a year were showing upper-single digit increases.
""Overall sales were strong the last three days before Christmas,"" Vice President of Marketing John Costello said, noting that clothing, tools, jewelry, multimedia computers and tires sold well.

584,"Just nine months ago, shareholders and analysts were pushing for H&amp;R Block Inc to spin off its CompuServe unit, arguing that the unit's value was being held back by H&amp;R Block's staid tax business.
On April 19, H&amp;R Block began that process with a public offering of about 20 percent of CompuServe Corp.
Analysts are still looking for the spinoff to be completed, but now the focus is on the sagging fortunes of the online service which is weighing on H&amp;R Block's performance.  
""The business model changed for CompuServe in a fairly dramatic way and now CompuServe's valuation is clearly holding back H&amp;R Block's valuation,"" said Martin Romm, analyst at CS First Boston.
On Thursday, H&amp;R Block reported a net loss for the fiscal 1997 second quarter of $74.1 million or $0.71 a share, compared to a loss of $8.3 million or $0.08 a share a year ago. Kansas City-based H&amp;R Block said the larger loss was primarily due to CompuServe's $58 million second quarter loss. H&amp;R Block still owns 80.1 percent of CompuServe.  
""How quickly things change,"" said Dennis Hudson, analyst at George K. Baum. ""What happened was a whole lot of competition came in (to the online market.) The market became saturated before people expected.""
In August, H&amp;R Block suspended the rest of the spinoff, citing CompuServe's performance and market conditions, among other factors.
Analysts said H&amp;R Block is waiting for implementation of CompuServe's newly announced business strategy -- focusing on business and professional users, rather than home users -- to push the company toward profits before completing the spinoff.  
H&amp;R Block also said Thursday it was reducing its quarterly dividend to $0.20 a share from $0.32, a move that it had previously said would occur after the spinoff was completed.
""The timing of (the dividend cut) was a little bit surprising,"" Romm said.
Both Romm and Hudson said they continued to rate H&amp;R Block stock as a buy and stressed that there was nothing wrong with the company's core tax business.

Intuit's BankNOW will be offered as part of America Online's Banking Center, along with products by CheckFree Corp, Online Resources and  Visa Interactive.  
BankNOW is geared to customers who wish to conduct banking transactions such as bill paying and fund transfers online, but do not use the personal finance software that is part of Intuit's Quicken banking package, Mountain View, California-based Intuit said in a news release.
So far, 14 U.S. financial institutions, including First Chicago NBD Corp and CoreStates Financial Corp are using BankNOW, with an additional eight committed to use the product, Intuit said.  
Dulles, Virginia-based America Online, said 19 financial institutions provide banking services on the system.
The BankNOW software can be downloaded for free from America Online. Financial institutions charge their customers for using the product.
For example, First Chicago said it will charge $3.95 a month for customers using online-banking and $9.95 a month for online banking and bill paying, though some premium checking account users will be able to do online banking for free.
First Chicago looks at BankNOW as a premium service it can offer customers.
""We think there is a large market for this,"" First Chicago spokesman Thomas Kelly said. ""We also think this is a point of differention in our markets.""
But to some, the scope of online banking still remains in doubt.
""I don't know whether its the wave of the future,"" said James Schutz, banking analyst at Chicago Corp. ""I don't think they (the banks) know either. I just think they're keeping their options open.""

600,"Australian insurance group National Mutual Holdings Ltd targeted China and Thailand as key markets on Tuesday as it fleshed out its role as the Asian arm of one of the industry's global heavyweights.
National Mutual, owned 51 percent by the recently expanded French insurance giant Axa SA, unveiled plans to double its representation this year in mainland China by opening three more local offices.
National Mutual is sweating over its application for an operating licence in China, along with other insurers eager for exposure to the most populous nation's emerging middle class.
""It is a key objective for the group and every effort is being made to obtain this licence,"" chairman Athol Lapthorne told National Mutual's annual meeting in Melbourne.
The group has applied to open offices in Wuhan, Dalian and Chengdu, initially to conduct market research. It already has offices in Shanghai, Guangdong and Beijing.  
National Mutual has been try to enter China for more than three years, during which it has signed a cooperation pact with Chinese insurer China Everbright-IHD Pacific Ltd and has donated HK$10 million (US$1.3 million) to set up a China education fund.
National Mutual and Axa, which recently merged with rival Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), launched a US$500 million China investment fund in September.
National Mutual has also applied to operate in Thailand, and is eyeing market entry in India, Vietnam and the Philippines.
Thailand and India are both reopening their insurance markets to foreign competition for the first time in many years, National Mutual managing director Geoff Tomlinson said.
The company is considering taking a stake in an existing insurer in the Philippines, and is taking a long-term view on Vietnam, which now has ""no real market to speak of"", he said. He gave no details on any likely investment in the Philippines.
""We are focusing our attention clearly today on China and Thailand,"" Tomlinson told reporters after the meeting.
""The work we're doing in relation to India, the Philippines and Vietnam is getting acquainted with people and seeing how business is done (there)...,"" he said. National Mutual has aligned itself in Thailand with a local joint venture partner, the General Finance group, but its application for an operating licence has yet to be decided.
National Mutual said it was not fazed by the new Thai government's decision to review the criteria for awarding insurance licences, and expected a decision within six months.
""It's a fertile market,"" Tomlinson said.
National Mutual, which is still powered mainly by its Australia and New Zealand life office National Mutual Life, suggested it could become an overnight force in Asian funds management if it inherits the regional assets of Axa and UAP.
National Mutual's funds management arm has A$2.0 billion (US$1.5 billion) in assets under management in Asia and stands to boost this to A$7.0 billion (corrects from A$7.0 million) if the parent decides to make National Mutual its Asian funds management operation, the company said.
""We will wait till they finalise their merger over there and talks will begin progressively,"" said Sam Kavourakis, National Mutual Funds Management managing director.

608,"Base-metals producer Pasminco Ltd forecast on Tuesday another tough year of cost-cutting, warning that a weak zinc market and a strong Australian dollar would make its last annual profit hard to beat.
""We are going to have a difficult year,"" chief executive David Stewart told reporters after delivering a subdued earnings outlook to shareholders at the group's annual meeting here.
Pasminco surprised financial markets markets in August by reporting a tripling of net profit to A$41 million for the year to June 30, despite weak prices for its major product, zinc.  
World zinc prices have not moved dramatically since then, but a stronger Australian dollar has made a major impact, dragging first quarter profit for 1996/97 lower, Stewart said.
""In the first quarter, our result...is below last year because of the impact of the (Australian) dollar,"" he said.
For every one-cent rise in the value of the Australian dollar against the greenback, Pasminco suffers a A$7.5 million fall in after-tax profit, Stewart said.
The local dollar on average was five cents stronger in the first quarter than its average throughout 1995/96, he added.

610,"Australia's biggest company, The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd (BHP), has agreed to pay its local steel workers a 10-percent pay rise over two years in a wage deal which could set the tone for other labour negotiations.
The deal, which covers over 13,000 workers at BHP steel plants around the country, falls short of pay rises being sought in some other areas of Australian manufacturing and provoked sharp words among rival trade unions.
The Australian Workers Union (AWU), which claims to represent about 80 percent of BHP steel workers, confirmed the deal on Friday, saying it was struck before Christmas and was well below its initial demand of 15 percent over two years.
But AWU organiser Mick Eagles told Reuters that historically low inflation in Australia was putting intense pressure on unions to modify their wage expectations.
""I think in this environment, with the way the CPI (inflation) is, I think the trend in the next 12 months and two years is going to put enormous pressure on wages to be kept low,"" he said.
""So a 10-percent outcome over two years is going to be seen as quite an achievement.""
The Australian Manufacturing Workers Union (AMWU), which wants to make an annual wage rise of over five percent as the benchmark in the metal trades industry, said the BHP deal would weaken unions' position in other wage negotiations underway.
""Obviously when that happens, it always weakens other unions' positions, but that's typical of the AWU,"" Vince Theuma, Victoria state organiser for the AMWU, told Reuters.
""They run in there and reach deals that we're not trying to chase.""
BHP, which has been working to slash costs to compensate for weak international steel prices and sluggish demand at home, described the wages agreement as satisfactory.
""Part of the agreement involves union agreement to introduce new types of employment arrangements which eliminate traditional demarcation lines and have novel concepts in terms of employment which provide us with a business benefit,"" a BHP spokesman said.
""We think this is a satisfactory resolution, bearing in mind the benefits of those innovative agreements,"" he told Reuters.
BHP initially offered eight percent over two years.
The agreement comes as wages growth continues to be cited by Australia's central bank as a major concern for inflation, now sitting well within the Reserve Bank's target range of between two and three percent.

626,"Major Australian banks have blown the dust off their Asian strategies and are moving quickly into the region as life gets tough at home.
Three of Australia's biggest banks have publicly renewed their Asian ambitions in the past few months as competition hots up for the local market and earnings begin to suffer. ""It's now you are starting to see them push a bit harder into Asia,"" said Melbourne-based banking analyst Ken McLay, of credit rating agency Standard and Poor's Group.
All of Australia's four big banks are now pursuing opportunities for interest and fee income in the rapidly growing markets of Asia, quietly urged on by the nation's central bank.
Their uniform embrace of Asia comes as two of Australia's biggest life insurers, National Mutual Holdings Ltd and Colonial Mutual, also boost their Asian profiles. Last week, Colonial bought out its Asian joint venture for US$163 million.
But Asia has not always commanded such uniform priority among Australia's financial institutions.
CENTRAL BANK UNHAPPY
Only six months ago, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) expressed disappointment that local banks were not seizing more opportunities to expand into Asia. At that time, the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ) was the only exception.
ANZ has long been Australia's most Asia-focused bank, with a retail network throughout India and operations in 40 other countries, most of them within the region.
In contrast, the most profitable bank, National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB), has focused in recent years on the United States and Europe. Westpac Banking Group virtually withdrew from Asia three and a half years ago to focus on home markets.
For years after the free-wheeling 1980s hit a wall of bad debts in Australia, banks had put expansion plans on hold and Asian strategies gathered dust as they repaired balance sheets.
But since late last year, talk of Asia is again on bankers' lips as interest margins contract in a tight local market where banks and non-bank institutions encroach on each other's turf. ALL EYES ON ASIA
Westpac bounced back into Asia last November, announcing an alliance with British-based Standard Chartered Bank Plc to provide select Asian banking services to Westpac clients.
The venture will focus primarily on Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia, before expanding into Vietnam and China, said Westpac.
NAB, which owns regional banks in the United States, Britain and Ireland, is also now looking for a partner in Asia.
""We've looked at a few (alliances) with banks and other institutions...It takes time to pull these things off,"" NAB managing director Don Argus told reporters last month.
Australia's fourth big bank, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd (CBA), also chimed in last week. It said it too would expand its Asian activities and was looking for joint-venture partners in Indo-China.
""Certainly the competition in the domestic market is extremely tough,"" S&amp;P's McLay told Reuters, adding he expected Australian banks' local asset quality and earnings to deteriorate.
""One of the ways to offset this is diversifaction...One way they are trying to diversify is to go offshore and I think that's a prudent strategy, but it has its risks,"" he added.
SMALL FISH, BIG POND
Australian banks, minnows compared with the regional might of banks like Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp Ltd, are likely to use geography and trade links to make their mark in Asia.
""They are small in size but the Australian banks do bring a lot of expertise. They are headquartered in the region, so they benefit from that and Australia is a major trading partner with a lot of these countries,"" McLay said.
""Australian banks are pretty well placed to piggy-back on the back of that. I think they will do quite well.""
Australia's central bank cleary hopes so, declaring that ""momentum for involvement in Asia has now clearly re-emerged"".
""The banks' focus has tended to be on the provision of trade finance and treasury services to corporates, although their retail activities in Asia are increasing,"" the RBA said in a written response to a parliamentary committee recently.
Australian banks' largest operations are in Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan, but they are fanning out, it said.
They are now eyeing opportunities in China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Burma and Cambodia as these nations open up their banking sectors to foreign entrants, the RBA said.

627,"Australian-based Foster's Brewing Group Ltd reported on Monday a small rise in interim net profit, but the bottom line result hid a strong performance from the group's home brews.
Foster's posted a 2.4 percent increase in net earnings to A$169.4 million, after booking a A$5.6 million abnormal loss.
The loss was due mainly to ongoing restructuring costs of the group's 40 percent owned Canadian brewer, Molson Breweries, and concealed a 10 percent rise in pre-abnormal net earnings to A$168 million.  
Foster's chief executive Ted Kunkel largely attributed the rise in pre-abnormal earnings to a ""sparkling"" performance from the group's domestic powerhouse, Carlton and United Breweries (CUB), in the six months to December 31.
""CUB had a four percent increase in the volume of beer sold, a remarkable result in a beer market which rose only 0.6 percent,"" he said in a statement.
CUB, which has taken a commanding market lead in Australia over chief rival Lion Nathan, contributed A$187.4 million in earnings before interest and tax, a rise of 11.5 percent over the first half of 1995/96 (July/June).  
The group result came in at slightly below the average forecast for first-half profit of around A$170 million.
The share price dipped a few cents after the announcement, but a Sydney broker said the stock was also moving to the tune of speculation Foster's may buy back the 37 percent stake held by resources giant The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd.
BHP indicated on Sunday it was in no hurry to sell its Foster's investment. Foster's shares were trading at A$2.60 at 0325 GMT (14.20 p.m.), down five cents on Friday's close.  
Foster's said it expected earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to be higher in the year to June 30 than the A$371 million reported in 1995/96, but that interest costs and the re-emergence of tax liability on Australian income would have an impact on the overall earnings for the 1996/97 year.
But Foster's said losses at its brewing operation in China widened in the six months ended December 31, 1996.
Foster's said its China operations recorded a loss before interest and tax of A$10.2 million in the first half compared with a loss of A$6.8 million in the 1995/96 first half.  
It said revenues in China for the half rose to A$20.9 million up from A$15.9 million a year earlier, with volumes sold rising to 539,000 hectolitres compared with 392,000 hectolitres.
Foster's wine unit, Mildara Blass, contributed A$33.4 million in earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) on sales of A$115.5 million, while its Rothbury Wines acquisition, completed in July 1996, was on track to achieved targeted first year earnings growth.

631,"Diversified manufacturer Pacific BBA Ltd said on Tuesday trading conditions in the second half of calendar 1996 had been softer than expected and it now expected 1996 profits to be around the same level as 1995.
""I've only seen July's results and verbal figures for August, but it will depend on how the rest of the year unfolds,"" Pacific BBA managing director Barry Jackson told Reuters.
""It's looking a bit softer than we would like. We were really budgetting for an economy that was stretching a touch but it doesn't look like it's going to do it,"" Jackson said.  
Jackson said in an interview the 1996 profit would be similar to calendar 1995's net profit of A$15.9 million.
""I think it's going to be much the same figure,"" he said.
Jackson cited the flat Australian economy, relatively weak automotive sales world-wide and the cost of developing new projects as the major constraints on short-term profit growth.
But he said the domestic economy should pick up in 1997 and put the group on track to achieving its goal of 15 to 20 percent annual growth in sales and earnings before interest and tax.  
But Jackson, speaking after the announcement of a A$200 million, five-year contract to supply brake parts to a North American vehicle manufacturer, seemed to be more concerned about coping with rapid growth than with a sluggish local economy.
Pacific BBA, which makes car parts, plastic packaging and construction products, has budgeted to spend around A$60 million in 1996 in capital expenditure, Jackson said.
""I think it (capital expenditure) will be two to three times depreciation (charges) for the next year or so,"" he said, adding that this was around twice the average for manufacturers.  
The group is examining a range of expansion opportunities in Asia and North America, requiring annual capital investments of between as little as A$5 million and A$200 million.
""We have people looking full time at these opportunities,"" he said. But the group must expand cautiously, he added.
""We've just got to be careful we don't over-stretch ourselves,"" he said. ""Growth holds back your short-term earnings,"" he added.
Jackson rued the failure of Pacific BBA's recent bid for fellow Australian manufacturer Azon Ltd, which was acquired instead by U.S.-based Illinois Tool Works Inc.  
Pacific BBA needs to become bigger or find a big partner to seize major new opportunities, especially in the automotive industry where the group wants to become a global niche player, he said.
Asked if its small size in world terms could become a brake on Pacific BBA's growth, Jackson said: ""It's not been yet, but it could become one and we were trying to say to the market when we were trying to buy Azon that this could give us the ability to do anything we want to.""

632,"The world's biggest mining house, RTZ Corp Plc-CRA Ltd, is set to report a sharp fall in annual profit this week after shouldering a slide in metal prices during the year and battling problems with its U.S. copper smelter, mining analysts said.
The group, which has operations spanning the globe, is on average expected to post a 26 percent fall in net profit before exceptional items to US$1.067 billion for calendar 1996, a Reuter survey of six Australian brokerages revealed.
The Anglo-Australian miner made US$1.441 billion in 1995.  
The analysts' forecasts range between US$1.04 billion and US$1.097 billion, although private forecasting service Barceps quoted much lower numbers in a survey last month.
The culprits behind RTZ-CRA's profit slump are seen as the copper price, which dipped below 90 U.S. cents a pound after the Sumitomo Corp trading scandal erupted in June, a sick aluminium price, down 16 percent in 1996, and problems with the flagship Bingham Canyon copper smelter in Utah.
Together, copper and aluminium earned almost 41 percent of RTZ-CRA's total revenue in 1995, and metal prices were promising enough early in 1996 for the group to talk of higher earnings.  
But metal prices caught cold and the prospects of improved profits also began to look sick mid-year, when the Sumitomo trading scandal involving trader Yasuo Hamanaka sent international copper prices crashing.
""Everything peaked ahead of this Hamanaka copper thing,"" said Peter O'Connor of Macquarie Bank.
""Most commodities slid from June on through to about September, October and there's been a bit of recovery in most metal prices since that time.""  
RTZ-CRA's iron ore business was also a disappointment, one analyst said, noting that sales for the year dropped six percent despite a lift in annual output.
Adding salt to the wound, the gold price also languished. Gold is a sensitive area for the mining giant, since it is fundamentally opposed to selling its production forward at a fixed price to lock in revenue.
RTZ-CRA's coal mines are also not expected to have relieved some of the pain inflicted on the group by weak prices.
One analyst expects coal earnings to fall 10 percent in 1996.  
RTZ-CRA's troubled Bingham Canyon smelter has stirred the deepest concerns among analysts, who have been waiting for the new plant to get it right after 18 months of hobbled operation.
""That's going to knock it (the result) around a bit,"" a Sydney-based analyst said.
The smelter is still not operating at full capacity and now faces a six-week shut-down soon for major modifications.
Copper division earnings are forecast to plunge by some 40 percent, according to HSBC James Capel's forecast.
Still, the brokerage likes the group's long-term prospects.  
""They have a very, very strong organic growth profile,"" said HSBC James Capel analyst Umit Safak. ""They have very substantial expansions coming up,"" he added.
These include expansions of the Escondida copper mine in Chile and the Grasberg copper and gold mine in Indonesia, as well as a stake in new gold mine on Papua New Guinea's Lihir island. Lihir is 22.8 percent owned by Southern Gold, which owned 75 percent owned by RTZ-CRA
""They have a very substantial exploration areas and a lot of very, very profitable projects in the pipeline,"" Safak said.

641,"Australian resources and steel group The Broken Hill Pty Co. (BHP) posted a 9.8-percent fall in first-half profits Friday, disappointing the share market but avoiding another mauling by investors.
BHP, whose shares have been hammered since its key markets in steel and copper turned sour six months ago, posted a A$790 million ($628 million) net profit for the six months to Nov. 30, down from A$867 ($689.3 million) for the year-ago period.
But Australia's largest-quoted company had its bottom line boosted by an abnormal gain of A$107 million ($85 million) and investors were initially not impressed.
""It's pretty lousy,"" said one fund manager's stock analyst. Another analyst disappointed with the result said the resources giant was still on track for a modest profit recovery for the full year to May 31, 1997.
Though BHP's battered copper division showed improvement, with the North American copper operations swinging back into profit, analysts had expected a first-half group operating profits of around A$760 million ($604.2 million).
Instead, BHP's operating profits fell 15.8 percent from the year-ago period to A$683 million ($543.0 million).
But managing director John Prescott said the second-quarter figures showed faster improvement in performance and that, despite weak copper and steel prices, the group was still investing in future growth.
Citing a sharp jump in exploration expenditure in the half year, he told reporters: ""That's an important part of sustaining our growth.""
Including abnormals, BHP's minerals, copper and steel divisions all contributed higher earnings in the latest three months against the August quarter. The steel division's earnings were flat.
Petroleum was the biggest earner with A$253 million ($201.1 million), but this included an abnormal gain of A$107 million ($85 million) from the settlement of a dispute over a gas resource tax.
BHP Petroleum's operating profits also included a A$82 million ($65.2 million) windfall from asset sales and a larger than expected exploration expense.
BHP's minerals division, a major world producer of iron ore and coal, doubled its contribution to profit in the second quarter to A$154 million ($122.4 million), due largely to higher world prices.
BHP Copper benefitted from a recent firming in the copper price and a cut of 7 U.S. cents per pound in its North American operating costs to post a second-quarter profit of A$132 million ($104.9 million), up from A$85 million ($67.6 million) in the first quarter.
The U.S. copper operations, acquired last January with the US$2.4 billion ($1.9 billion) purchase of Magma Copper, made a loss on a full-cost basis in the first quarter. Prescott said Friday Magma had swung back into profit in the second quarter.
BHP Steel's second-quarter profit was flat at A$90 million ($71.6 million).

645,"The computer software and instruction kit for the death machine used in the world's first legal mercy killing will soon be available on the Internet, the Australian doctor who developed it said on Tuesday.
Dr Philip Nitschke, who last month connected cancer sufferer Bob Dent to the machine in Australia's outback Northern Territory, said Internet users would be able to copy the software and instructions from a home page now being developed.
""We see no reason in restricting it in any way,"" Nitschke told Reuters in Melbourne, where he is due to demonstrate the machine at an euthanasia conference this week.
The death machine used in the Northern Territory, which has the world's only voluntary euthanasia law, enables people to give themslves lethal injections with the tap of computer keys.
On September 22, Nitschke hooked Dent up to the machine with an intravenous tube. Dent, a 66-year-old former carpenter and one-time Christian missionary, started the flow of lethal drugs by entering three simple computer commands.
""Once the intravenous line is put into the patient...then it's simple a matter of the patient pressing the response to the questions on the screen,"" Nitschke said. The computer programme asks three times if the patient wishes to go ahead.
Dubbed Australia's ""Dr Death"" by opponents of assisted suicide, Nitschke said the idea of an euthanasia home page was a response to strong interest in Dent's death and the new law, atlhough he said he was having some logistical problems getting the page up and running.
An estimated 50 million people use the worldwide Internet computer network.
""It's to let people know and give them some idea of the way this is being done in a responsible fashion in the Northern Territory,"" he said, adding he had already sent how-to-do-it kits overseas and around Australia using electronic mail.
A doctor cannot lawfully hook a patient up to the machine anywhere outside the Northern Territory, whether overseas or in Australia's six states and other territory, Nitschke said.
But he dismissed suggestions he could face criminal charges if a machine built from material supplied on the Internet was used in mercy killings outside the remote outback jurisdiction.
""I feel very safe as far as giving the details of the equipment and as far as providing the software and the like,"" he said. The software is a ""trivial"" part of the device, he added.
The software and equipment needed to build the machine are very simple and can be bought for around A$200 (US$160), though the lethal drugs are extremely difficult to obtain, he said.
He said he was now developing another death machine which used carbon monoxide and an oxygen mask, enabling people to end their lives without needing someone to insert intravenous tubes.
""When people get too old and frail it can be very difficult to get access to veins and gas is a much easier way to go, and carbon monoxide is a painless and acceptable way...,"" he said.
Nitschke described his machine as a ""slicker"" version of the suicide device designed by U.S. euthanasia advocate Dr Jack Kevorkian, who has publicly acknowledged attending more than 40 deaths since he began his assisted-suicide crusade in 1990.

653,"General Motors Corp cut a deal to end a costly strike at an Indianapolis metal stamping plant on Saturday, about 14 hours after it announced a tentative national contract agreement with the United Auto Workers union.
The five-day Indianapolis strike had threatened to paralyze most of GM's North American light truck production by early next week. Along with a second, still-unresolved walkout at GM's Janesville, Wisconsin, truck plant, the dispute was responsible for the idling of more than 19,000 workers.
But the 2,750 Indianapolis strikers could be back on the job stamping out fenders, doors, hoods and other truck body parts by Sunday night following a ratification vote scheduled for Sunday morning, said Patrick Morrissey, a spokesman for GM's Metal Fabricating Division.
However, GM's full-size pickup truck plant in Pontiac, Michigan, may still shut down on Monday due to shortages of Indianapolis-made parts, joining four other idled truck plants and an crippled engine plant.
Ronald Gettelfinger, UAW regional director in Indianapolis, said the new local labor agreement, reached at about 6:15 p.m. EST (2315 GMT) on Saturday, was not influenced by the national GM-UAW labor accord, which covers 215,000 U.S. hourly workers.
The national contract defines wages, benefits, job security and other broad issues, while local pacts cover plant specific issues like work rules and staffing levels.
""We've got great negotiators at the top,"" Gettelfinger said. ""This was local issues.""
He declined to discuss the grievances that sparked the strike. They were believed to include demands for more jobs to cope with an increasing workload and protections for skilled trades workers.
UAW President Stephen Yokich, who announced the national pact at a 2 a.m. EST (0700 GMT) news conference, held out the threat of more local strikes to keep GM from dragging its feet in negotiations with its 123 locals.
""We can't tell you what's going to happen in the other locals,"" Yokich said. ""I would suggest that the company work very hard and get their locals cleaned up.""
President Bill Clinton applauded UAW-GM agreement on Saturday. ""I am very hopeful that the tentative agreement will be ratified and that the outstanding local issues will quickly be resolved so that everyone can get back to work,"" he said.
About 4,800 workers in Janesville remain on strike, although UAW Local 95 officials said local talks intensified on Saturday. The plant, which builds GM's popular Chevrolet Tahoe, Suburban and GMC Yukon sport-utility vehicles, is one of the automaker's most profitable factories.
Analysts estimate the UAW-related shutdowns will cost the carmaker up to $20 million a day in lost profits, on top of an estimated $350 million loss from a Canadian walkout that ended on Oct. 23.
The UAW-GM national agreement will be submitted to rank-and-file members for ratification after about 250 UAW leaders meet to consider the pact on Wednesday in Chicago. The deal was unanimously approved by the union's national GM bargaining council.
Details of the pact were not released on Saturday, but Gerald Knechtel, GM vice president of personnel, said it fits within the pattern that the UAW set at Ford Motor Co and Chrysler Corp
Both of those companies agreed to guarantee jobs for 95 percent of their current hourly workforces and will give workers a $2,000 bonus in the first year of the contract, followed by 3 percent raises in the second and third years of the contract.
One union official said the pact maintains the 95 percent job guarantee but allows GM some flexibility to exit certain unprofitable businesses and to allow employment at some factories to fall below that threshold.
In a sign that contentious issues remain, company and union officials did not announce the pact in a joint news conference with the traditional handshakes and smiles. Instead, they made grim-faced separate statements to reporters gathered at GM's Detroit headquarters building.
""I think we said back in June that it would be a difficult negotiation, and I think we fulfilled that expectation,"" said a visibly tired GM Chairman Jack Smith. ""Like any negotiation, you never get everything you want.""

655,"Local strikes in Wisconsin and Indiana began taking their toll on the rest of General Motors Corp.'s truck production Wednesday, clouding the automaker's national contract talks with the United Auto Workers.
GM said the day-old walkout at its Indianapolis metal stamping plant would force it to halt production of full-size Chevrolet and GMC pickup trucks at its Fort Wayne, Ind., assembly plant Wednesday night.
The Indianapolis walkout on Tuesday has halted shipments of major steel body panels to nine of GM's 11 North American truck assembly plants, threatening to shut them down within days.
Analysts said Wednesday the cost of the strikes by 2,750 workers in Indianapolis and 4,800 workers at its Janesville, Wis., truck assembly plant could mount quickly, eating into profits from GM's lucrative light truck operations.
The shutdown of the Janesville plant alone could cost GM $50 million a week in pre-tax profits, said David Healy, an auto analyst with Burnham Securities.
The southern Wisconsin factory, which employs 4,800 workers, is the sole source for GM's popular four-door, full-size Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban and GMC Yukon sport utility vehicles. Analysts estimate that GM makes about $9,000 in variable profits on each of the trucks.
In addition to Janesville and Fort Wayne, the Indianapolis plant supplies facilities in Pontiac and Flint, Mich.; Oshawa, Ontario; Linden, N.J.; Shreveport, La.; Moraine, Ohio, and Silao, Mexico.
""It really starts to add up quickly when you add in all of the other big C/K pickups they can lose,"" said Lehman Brothers analyst Joseph Phillippi.
The UAW strikes came as GM is still staggering from a three-week strike in Canada that curtailed production at a number of U.S. plants and may cost up to $450 million.
On Wednesday, GM said it still had 23,158 U.S. workers idled due to shortages of Canadian-made parts, but added that 3,200 workers at its Buick City assembly plant in Flint, Mich., were scheduled to return to work on Thursday.
No other UAW strikes had started on Wednesday, but UAW spokesman Reg McGhee said the union was not ruling out other walkouts. UAW President Stephen Yokich raised the threat of local strikes on Monday after GM's national contract covering 215,000 UAW workers expired.
""Steve made it clear that without a national contract, the locals are on their own,"" McGhee said, noting that they do not have to provide GM with the typical five-day notice before a walkout.
Some UAW officials speculated that other stamping and parts plants may also be struck, because they would force shutdowns at other facilities.
National contract talks continued Wednesday at GM's Detroit headquarters, but officials declined to say whether progress was being made.
""Talks are taking place at all levels,"" said GM spokesman Charles Licari.
Although UAW officials said the strikes were called over local issues, analysts said it was clear that the actions were aimed at pushing GM into a tentative national agreement.
That may take place before Saturday, when about 250 UAW leaders from GM plants across the nation are scheduled to meet in Detroit to discuss the status of the talks.
The future of 12 domestic parts plants that GM considers uncompetitive remained a major sticking point in the negotiations Wednesday. GM wants to exclude several of the plants from union demands that it guarantee employment for 95 percent of UAW workers over the next three years.
Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. have already granted such guarantees, but GM, the least efficient of Detroit's Big Three automakers, wants changes to the pattern to allow it to cut costs.
GM has already put two of the 12 plants on the sale block -- a door hinge plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich., that together employ 2,100 workers.
""We know the sale is going to happen. We're concerned about what's going to happen to us,"" said Whitey Hale, president of UAW Local 326 in Flint.

656,"Second-shift workers at General Motors Corp. 's Cadillac assembly plant here will not report to work on Monday because of the Canadian Auto Workers strike and thousands more U.S. assembly employees may be laid off this week, GM said on Sunday.
The Cadillac plant on the outskirts of Detroit will operate with only one shift on Monday and Tuesday, when it is expected to halt production completely unless the strike is resolved, GM spokesman Thomas Klipstine said.
""Once they run out of parts, that's it,"" he said.
The plant employs more than 3,000 hourly workers represented by the United Auto Workers union, but Klipstine said he did not know the exact number of workers on each shift.
The sprawling factory, which builds Cadillac's DeVille, Seville and Eldorado luxury cars, depends on interior trim parts made at a strike-bound plant in Windsor, Ontario, just across the Detroit River.
GM's Canadian workers began an escalating strike on Oct. 3, shutting down all of the automaker's operations in Canada by late on Oct. 9.
The company and union have been unable to reach an agreement for a new national labor contract for GM's 26,000 CAW members because of disagreements over the thorny issue of shifting parts work to outside suppliers, known as outsourcing.
The union wants tough restrictions on outsourcing to protect its members' jobs, while GM, the least efficient automaker in North America, says it needs flexibility on parts purchases to become more competitive.
So far, GM's U.S. operations have been relatively untouched by the strike in Canada, largely because the CAW gave the automaker ample warning that it was preparing to strike. That, coupled with the slow escalation of the strike over a week-long period, allowed GM to build up stocks of some parts and prepare for the walkout.
""The bottom line is there was no surprise with this strike,"" Klipstine said. ""We did as much as we could, but we don't have huge amounts of parts stockpiled.""
Klipstine said he did not know how much longer GM could operate its U.S. plants.
Industry analysts have said some of GM's plants may be able to continue to operate until the end of the month, particularly those that build GM's popular full-size pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles.
On Friday, Ford Motor Co. President Alex Trotman said he did not believe his company would be able to gain a significant amount of market share due to the strike, because there has been ""little evidence"" that GM's hottest-selling truck lines will be affected.
Most GM dealers have sufficient car inventories to weather the strike without turning away customers, he said.
Thus far, the CAW has been responsible for the idling of only 2,000 U.S. workers.
The walkout forced the layoff of 1,050 workers at an engine plant in Tonawanda, N.Y., near Buffalo, and 950 at a transmission plant in Ypsilanti, Mich., near Detroit.
By contrast, a UAW strike in March at two Dayton, Ohio, brake plants had forced more than 55,000 of GM's workers off the job just one week after that walkout began.
No formal talks were scheduled between GM and the CAW, although CAW President Buzz Hargrove was expected to be in contact with GM's chief negotiator, Dean Munger.
Canada celebrates its national Thanksgiving Day holiday on Monday.
Meanwhile, in the United States, negotiators working towards a contract for GM's 215,000 United Auto Workers members also took the weekend off.
The UAW talks have taken a low profile during the Canadian strike.

657,"In a sign that agreement on a labour contract between General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers may still have significant hurdles, the union said Friday it cancelled a meeting of its National GM Council that was scheduled here for Saturday.
The council, made up of about 250 plant-level leaders at GM locals across the country, was expected to vote on a tentative agreement covering GM's 215,000 UAW workers.
UAW spokesman Reg McGhee declined to give a reason for the cancellation, but said the council will meet instead on Wednesday, Nov. 6, in Chicago, if the union reaches an agreement with GM in the next few days.
One official close to the talks said the meeting was cancelled because the union did not reach a deal in time to print up summaries for the GM council members to review on Saturday. He did not rule out reaching an agreement on Friday.
""They're working on trying to resolve the final issues,"" GM spokesman Gerry Holmes said.
Still, the cancellation was viewed as a negative sign for the GM contract talks, which had resumed Friday after bargainers rested up before making another push for a tentative agreement. They bargained for 32 hours on Wednesday and Thursday, fuelling optimism that a settlement was near.
The two sides have been haggling over the total number of hourly workers that GM will guarantee to maintain over the next three years.
Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. have agreed to guarantee jobs for 95 percent of their current hourly workforces, but GM wants to exclude several parts plants from the guarantees.
GM, the least efficient of Detroit's Big Three, wants changes to the pattern to allow it to cut costs and shift more parts work to outside suppliers.
GM is expected to match the Ford and Chrysler wage package, which calls for a $2,000 bonus in the first year, and 3 percent base wage increases in the second and third years.
Meanwhile, the toll of lost profits and idled workers from local strikes in Janesville, Wis., and Indianapolis continued to mount for GM.
Including 2,750 strikers at the Indianapolis metal stamping plant and 4,809 at the Janesville truck assembly plant, GM said the walkouts had idled a total of 13,309 workers by midday Friday.
Another 2,400 were scheduled to be sent home from GM's Shreveport, La., plant later Friday afternoon, and up to 2,500 workers in Linden, N.J., were told not to report to work on Monday.
The two factories are among nine GM truck plants in North America that receive fenders, hoods, roofs and other major body panels from Indianapolis.
Michael Ward, an auto analyst at Paine Webber, said the Janesville, Fort Wayne and Moraine shutdowns alone will cost GM $10 million a day in after-tax lost profits.
""We're looking at $10 million a day right now, and that could easily expand to $20 million by Monday,"" Ward said.
About 3,500 workers were idled at GM's Moraine, Ohio, compact sport utility vehicle plant Thursday night, while 2,250 workers were laid off at GM's Fort Wayne, Ind., full-size pickup truck assembly plant on Wednesday night.
In addition, 900 workers who build V-8 engines for trucks assembled in Janesville and Fort Wayne were idled on Friday.
A full-size truck plant in Flint, Mich., had been expected to be idled Thursday night, but union officials said GM diverted enough parts to keep it running several more days.
""GM'll start funnelling the parts around to the plants that they want to keep going,"" said Doug Bellamy, vice president of UAW Local 598 in Flint.
Layoffs from the UAW strikes are increasing as GM's U.S. car operations are still staggering from the effects of the three-week Canadian Auto Workers strike, which ended Oct. 23.
GM said it still had 18,958 workers idled by continuing shortages of Canadian-made parts at six car assembly plants, six engine and transmission plants and four metal stamping facilities.

660,"The president of the Canadian Auto Workers held out little hope on Friday for a quick end to a 10-day-old strike against General Motors Corp and said his counterparts at the United Auto Workers are having similar problems reaching a labor pact with the automaker.
Basil ""Buzz"" Hargrove told reporters in a conference call that GM is trying to resist the U.S. pattern agreement set at Ford Motor Co and Chrysler Corp, which guarantee employment levels at 95 percent of the companies' current hourly workforces.  
The provision is aimed at curbing the automakers' ability to shift work to outside suppliers, known as outsourcing, which also is the major sticking point in the CAW talks.
""I'd be quite happy if Steve were to get a settlement,"" Hargrove said of UAW President Stephen Yokich. ""He's having the same problem -- getting the pattern agreement with GM.""
He said GM has ""agreed to the principle of limiting the outsourcing"" in the U.S."", but doesn't want to meet the 95 percent employment guarantee and wants to exclude parts plants it has on sale from the guarantee.  
Talks between the UAW and GM have been low key during the Canadian strike. Negotiators have met only during normal business hours and do not plan to meet over the weekend.
UAW spokesman Reg McGhee declined to characterize progress of the discussions, only to say bargainers were ""down to the larger issues.""
But Hargrove has not asked Yokich to delay a U.S. settlement with GM during the Canadian strike.
The CAW launched an escalating strike on October 3 and all the union's 26,000 GM workers were on the picket line by midnight on Wednesday.  
The UAW has about 215,000 U.S. hourly workers at GM and, so far, only about 2,000 have been idled at an engine plant and a transmission plant.
The strike may affect some of GM's U.S. plants next week, although the automaker canceled most overtime work this week.
Hargrove said he saw no progress in talks with the automaker.
""I don't want to kid anybody,"" he said. ""It hasn't been very productive last few days, I do not believe it will be productive today.""
Hargrove wanted the Canadian walkout to have as little effect on GM's U.S. production as possible so as to protect UAW workers and the profit-sharing checks they expect to receive this year. Prolonged shutdowns in the U.S. due to lack of Canadian-made parts could seriously hurt GM's profits and reduce profit sharing for employees.

661,"Lear Corp., furthering its quest to supply complete car interiors, said Friday it agreed to buy the instrument panel and trim parts unit of Denmark-based Borealis Holding AB.
Lear said it signed a memorandum of understanding to acquire Borealis Industrier AB for undisclosed terms.
Based in Gothenburg, Sweden, Borealis Industrier manufacturers instrument panels, door panels, climate systems, exterior trim and various other components for the European car and truck industry.
Borealis Industrier had 1995 sales of about $230 million and owns five plants in Sweden that employ about 1,800 people.
Primary customers for the business include Swedish carmakers AB Volvo and Saab Automobile AB and truckmaker Scania AB.
Borealis Holding is owned by Finnish state-controlled oil and energy group Neste Oy and Norwegian state-owned oil group Statoil AS.
Completion of the transaction is subject to approval by the Swedish competition authority and other conditions.
Lear said the acquisition supports its strategy of having in-house capability to provide total automotive interior systems, including instrument panels.
""Not only does this acquisition strengthen relations with our European customers, but it positions Lear as the only independent automotive supplier in the world with in-house capabilities in all five interior systems -- broadening the appeal of our already strong one-stop-shopping competitive advantage,"" Lear Chairman Kenneth Way said in a statement.
The deal is the latest of a series of consolidation moves in the automotive interior market. Lear earlier this year purchased carpet and floor-mat maker Masland Corp. for $384 million, and last year bought door panel and console maker Automotive Industries Inc for $626 million.
Lear's U.S. operations include the manufacturing of a wide range of automotive interior components.
The company's stock was unchanged Friday at $38 a share on the New York Stock Exchange.
Lear's competitors are also pursuing the same acquisition strategy.
Johnson Controls Inc., which has a strong seating business, recently acquired interior parts maker Prince Automotive, based in Holland Mich., for $1.35 billion in cash.
Canada's Magna International Inc., one of the ""Big Three"" automotive interior firms along with Lear and Johnson Controls, recently acquired seat maker Douglas &amp; Lomason Co. for $135 million.

667,"The United Auto Workers union unleashed two local strikes against General Motors Corp.'s truck operations Tuesday night in bids to boost pressure on the automaker for new national and local labor agreements.
About 2,750 members of UAW Local 23 walked off the job at GM's Indianapolis metal stamping plant at about 6 p.m. EST, followed an hour later by 4,800 workers who struck the automaker's Janesville, Wis., truck assembly plant.
The negotiations at GM's Detroit headquarters were scheduled to resume Wednesday morning after adjourning for the night around 9 p.m. EST Tuesday.
GM spokesman Jerry Holmes said the automaker had no formal response to the walkouts, which threaten to paralyze much of GM's light truck production, the automaker's biggest source of profits.
The Janesville plant builds GM's popular Chevrolet Tahoe, Suburban and GMC Yukon sport utility vehicles. The Indianapolis plant supplies doors, fenders, hoods and other sheet-metal stampings to nine of the automaker's North American truck assembly plants.
All of GM's truck-related plants have been working heavy overtime in recent months, and the increasing workload has put a strain on workers.
UAW President Stephen Yokich had raised the threat of local strikes Monday after intense negotiations over the weekend failed to produce an agreement. He also chided GM for a lack of progress in local negotiations at individual plants.
He said the expiration of GM's national contract covering 215,000 UAW workers Sunday meant that local units were free to strike to get local issues resolved.
Union officials also said there could be other local walkouts in the near future.
""I'm the one who called this strike,"" Ron Gettelfinger, UAW regional director, said of the Indianapolis walkout. He added that the action was aimed solely at resolving local issues, which he refused to identify.
In Janesville, UAW Local 95 said in a statement that it, too, struck over local issues because 44 bargaining sessions failed to produce an agreement with the automaker.
Only a handful of GM's 123 local units have signed new local contracts with the automaker. The pacts typically cover items like work rules, staffing levels and health and safety standards, while the national agreement covers wages, benefits, job security and other broad issues.
Bargainers in the national talks reconvened at GM's headquarters here Tuesday after a day off Monday. Still on the table is the future of 12 U.S. parts plants that GM considers uncompetitive, the company's top components executive confirmed Tuesday.
J.T. Battenberg, president of GM's Delphi Automotive Systems division, told reporters at an automotive supplier conference here that none of the 12 factories have improved their performance enough in recent months to be dropped from the company's list of troubled facilities.
GM has refused to identify the plants, but the list includes a door hinge plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich., that the automaker intends to sell. Together, the plants employ 2,100 UAW members.
The automaker wants to exclude several of the plants from the union's demand that it guarantee employment for 95 percent of its UAW workforce over the next three years.
Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. have already granted such guarantees, but GM, the least efficient of Detroit's Big Three automakers, wants changes to the pattern that allow it to cut costs.
The strikes mark a major departure in Yokich's bargaining strategy, which until last week had been marked by unusual conciliation and virtually no strike threats.
The walkouts could help pressure GM into a tentative national agreement before Saturday, when the UAW's 250-member National GM Council is scheduled to meet in Detroit. The council, made up of plant-level leaders, would have to approve a plant.
The walkouts also came less than a week after Canadian Auto Workers members returned to work following a three-week strike over the issues of job security and outsourcing, or the shifting of work to outside contractors.
GM also said Tuesday that 22,913 workers in its U.S. assembly, powertrain and stamping operations remained idle because of lingering shortages of Canadian-made parts.
The automaker said it laid off an additional 465 workers at its Lordstown, Ohio, metal stamping plant Tuesday, one of four such plants still affected by shortages.
",DavidLawder,1
678,"Workers at a key General Motors Corp. metal stamping plant in Indianapolis began returning to work on Sunday after ratifying a deal to end a five-day strike that threatened to paralyze most of the automaker's light truck production.
But a similar settlement eluded negotiators at GM's Janesville, Wis., truck assembly plant, where a strike over local issues by 4,800 workers entered its sixth day.
Janesville, which builds GM's popular Chevrolet Tahoe, Suburban and GMC Yukon sport/utility vehicles, is one of the automaker's most profitable factories.
The deal for 2,750 workers in Indianapolis, which came hours after GM and the UAW announced a tentative agrement for a new national labor contract early Saturday morning, calls for the hiring of 200 new workers at the plant.
It also leaves seniority rules for skilled trades workers intact and provides thousands of dollars in back pay for workers to settle grievances.
""I regret we did have to call a strike here,"" said UAW regional director Ron Gettlefinger in Indianapolis. ""I'm hoping other General Motors plants I'm responsible for will heed the seriousness of local agreements.""
The Indianapolis strike shut off shipments of fenders, doors, hoods and oher steel body panels to nine of GM's North American light truck plants. By the weekend, parts shortages due to the strike had caused GM to shut down truck plants in Fort Wayne, Ind., Shreveport, La., Moraine, Ohio and Linden, N.J.
Including the strikers at Janesville and Indianapolis, the UAW walkouts had idled over 19,000 workers, in addition to 18,858 GM workers still on layoff because of lingering parts shortages from a three-week Canadian Auto Workers strike that ended Oct. 23.
UAW officials said stamping operations would resume Sunday night, with the plant back to full production by Monday, but that may not prove soon enough to keep other plants from running out of parts, including GM's full-size pickup truck plant in Pontiac, Mich., which employs nearly 6,000 people.
Other threatened plants that receive parts from Indianapolis are located in Flint, Mich., Oshawa, Ontario and Silao, Mexico.
On Saturday, UAW President Stephen Yokich put GM on notice that some of the automaker's GM's 123 other locals may go on strike over lack of progress in local negotiations.
A clearer picture of the UAW-GM national agreement, which covers some 215,000 U.S. hourly workers, began to emerge Sunday. The contract meets the pattern set by Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. on most major issues, including a guarantee that GM will maintain jobs for 95 percent of its current hourly work force.
But the pact contains exceptions that will allow GM to sell some unprofitable parts plants, including a door hinge plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich.
On economics, the pact gives wokers a $2,000 bonus in the first year of the contract, followed by 3 percent raises in the second and third years of the contract. It also provides generous gains in pension benefits, including the elimination of a cap on outside earnings for retirees, which is viewed as a major incentive for older workers to leave the company.
Like Ford and Chrysler, GM will be able to pay workers in new auto parts businesses that it enters a lower wage than the standard $19 an hour paid by the Big Three.
GM has been trying to shed parts businesses as it tries to catch up to Chrysler's and Ford's efficiency levels. But analysts say the pact could slow GM's progress in trying to shrink its work force through attrition.
""GM is not going to get the competitive lift from labor in this contract,"" said Eugene Jennings, a retired Michigan State University professor of management who is close to Detroit's Big Three automakers. ""They have to find  enough efficiencies to support excess labor.""
",DavidLawder,1
679,"Investors pushed General Motors Corp. shares higher Monday, a sign that Wall Street is pleased that the auto giant signed a new national labour agreement that allows it to shed some workers.
GM's shares traded up $1.50 at $55.50 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange after the company signed the tentative agreement with the United Auto Workers union early Saturday morning.
""The Wall Street reaction reflects some belief that GM didn't cave in,"" said Burnham Securities auto analyst David Healy. ""GM appears to have retained its right to manage and indulge in some outsourcing.""
Analysts said the pact will allow GM to reduce its 215,000-member hourly work force by 30,000 or more during the next three years through normal retirements.
The pact contains a nominal guarantee that GM maintain employment of about 95 percent of its current work force -- a pattern set in the Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. agreements -- but it also allows GM to exit some unprofitable parts businesses and sell certain components plants.
David Cole, director of the University of Michigan's Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation, said he believes the pact will help GM to to boost efficiency.
""GM can use attrition to shrink its work force and take advantage of productivity improvements,"" Cole said. ""The UAW has as much interest in a competitive General Motors as the shareholders do.""
But the positive reaction was tempered by a continuing strike at GM's Janesville, Wis., truck assembly plant, where 4,809 workers walked off the job Oct. 29 over demands for more jobs.
The plant makes the Chevrolet Tahoe, Suburban and GMC Yukon sport/utilities, which are among GM's most popular -- and most profitable -- vehicles. UAW Local 95 wants GM to hire more workers in Janesville to reduce the strain of heavy overtime and an increasing workload.
On Sunday, members of UAW Local 23 returned to work at a key metal stamping plant in Indianapolis after ratifying a settlement on a new local contract.
The union members had struck for five days, shutting off shipments of fenders, doors, hoods and other steel body panels to nine of GM's 11 North American light truck assembly plants.
By the weekend, strike-caused parts shortages forced GM to shut down factories in Fort Wayne, Ind., Shreveport, La., Moraine, Ohio, and Linden, N.J.
GM said the Fort Wayne and Moraine plants are scheduled to resume normal operations Tuesday, while Shreveport and Linden will be running again by Thursday.
Last week, the UAW walkouts and lingering parts shortages from last month's Canadian Auto Workers strike had idled nearly 38,000 GM workers in the United States.
GM did not say how many workers were still idle, but added that four car plants stricken by the CAW strike will be back to full production by Tuesday, including Detroit; Lordstown, Ohio; and Lake Orion and Lansing, Mich.
Healy estimated that between the two walkouts, GM's production losses will total 175,000 cars and trucks, which will slash the company's fourth-quarter profits by $600 million to $650 million.
In contrast to the tense atmosphere that continues to surround the GM labour situation, UAW President Stephen Yokich and Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton signed a new three-year contract in an historic ceremony at the union's Detroit headquarters.
The signing marked the first time that a Big Three automaker has signed a new labour accord at the UAW's Solidarity House.
Yokich and Eaton were in a jovial mood as they signed the pact -- a stark contrast to the separate, grim-faced news conferences where the UAW and GM announced their deal early Saturday morning.
Yokich told reporters the Chrysler signing ""shows that this company recognises the union and wants to work with them.""
Meanwhile, GM declared an unchanged quarterly dividend of 40 cents a share on its $1-2/3 par value common stock.
Some analysts had expected GM's board of directors to increase the annual payout to $2 a share from $1.60 because of its growing cash pile. But Lehman Brothers analyst Joseph Phillippi said the board did not want to disrupt the UAW pact's ratification by giving more cash to shareholders.

689,"Negotiators for General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers adjourned their talks on Saturday evening with less than 30 hours to go before a midnight Sunday strike deadline.
Bargainers, led by UAW President Stephen Yokich, took their second consecutive night off since the union announced on Friday that it will cancel its contract with the automaker at 11:59 p.m. EST Sunday (0359 GMT on Monday).
GM spokesman Charles Licari declined to say whether the adjournment was a sign of poor progress in the talks aimed at a new national labor agreement covering the automaker's 215,000 UAW workers. Typically bargaining runs around the clock when a settlement is near.
The deadline marks the first time the UAW has threatened a strike in its 1996 negotiations with Detroit's Big Three automakers, which up to now have been marked by an unusually conciliatory tone and extremely secretive discussions.
It also came two days after GM's 26,000 Canadian Auto Workers members began returning to work on Wednesday after a three-week strike against the automaker's Canadian operations.
In the U.S. talks, the two sides are still at odds over the same issues that caused the walkout in Canada -- the union's demand for job security and GM's desire to sell several parts plants and maintain flexibility to shift components work to outside suppliers, a practice known as outsourcing.
GM wants to modify the UAW contract pattern set by Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp., which have agreed to guarantee jobs for 95 percent of their current UAW work forces over the next three years.
GM, the least efficient U.S. automaker, wants to exclude certain components plants from the employment guarantees, including a door hardware plant in Flint, Michigan and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Michigan.
Ford and Chrysler buy more of their parts from outside suppliers than GM does, often from firms that pay their workers significantly less than the $19-an-hour base wage paid in Big Three factories.
Yokich said in a statement on Friday that he was not optimistic that a deal could be reached before the deadline but told workers to remain on the job until further notice.
On Saturday UAW spokesman Reg McGhee declined to say whether the union was still pessimistic about the talks.
""That was yesterday's statement,"" McGhee said. ""We're just saying that the talks are continuing and we're not characterizing the progress.""
GM spokesman Charles Licari said the automaker was prepared for round-the-clock negotiations, but declined to provide further details of the talks.
GM's chief negotiator, Gerald Knechtel, said on Friday that the automaker was ""committed to entering into agreement that balances the needs of our employees and the UAW with the flexibility GM needs to continue to improve our competitiveness.""
GM, flush with $14 billion in cash on its balance sheet and operating earnings that more than doubled in the third quarter to $1 billion, has shown willingness to sustain costly strikes to continue its quest for competitiveness.
Industry analysts estimate the cost of the Canadian strike at $150 million to $450 million, while a 17-day strike at two Dayton, Ohio, brake plants in March reduced GM's first quarter profit by $900 million.
But the effects of the Canadian strike continued to linger last week, as more of GM's U.S. assembly plants plants ran out of Canadian-made parts.
In Flint, local UAW officials said GM told more than 6,600 workers not to report to work at the automaker's massive Buick City complex on Monday.

690,"General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers union reached a tentative deal for a job-preserving labour contract early Saturday, but the accord failed to halt costly local strikes in Wisconsin and Indiana.
The three-year national agreement, which covers wages, benefits and job security for GM's 215,000 hourly UAW workers, did little to resolve contentious plant-specific issues that remain unresolved at most of the carmaker's 123 locals.
UAW President Stephen Yokich, announcing the pact at a 2 a.m. EST (0700 GMT) news conference, held out the threat of ""We can't tell you what's going to happen in the other locals,"" Yokich said. ""I would suggest that the company work very hard and get their locals cleaned up.""
President Clinton applauded the agreement. ""I am very hopeful that the tentative agreement will be ratified, and that the outstanding local issues will quickly be resolved so that everyone can get back to work,"" he said.
On Tuesday night, about 2,750 workers walked off the job at GM's Indianapolis metal stamping plant and 4,800 struck the company's Janesville, Wisconsin, truck assembly plant over local grievances, including demands for more workers to deal with increasing workloads.
The strike at Indianapolis cut off supplies of fenders, hoods, roofs and other steel body panels to nine GM North American truck plants. It threatened to paralyse much of GM's highly profitable light truck operations by early next week.
On Saturday, more than 19,000 workers at seven GM assembly and components plants were idled because of the two strikes. That comes on top of 18,958 U.S. workers still on layoff status because of lingering parts shortages from a three-week Canadian Auto Workers strike that ended Oct. 23.
Analysts estimate the UAW-related shutdowns will cost the carmaker $20 million a day in lost profits, on top of a $350 million loss from the Canadian walkout.
But the national UAW accord Saturday appeared to push negotiations in Janesville and Indianapolis forward. ""I think they've intensified their talks a bit,"" said an official at UAW Local 95 in Janesville.
UAW Local 292 officials also reported progress in local talks at GM's 5,500-employee Delco Electronics plant in Kokomo, Indiana. On Thursday, the unit sought Yokich's permission to join the other locals on strike.
The UAW-GM national agreement will be submitted to rank-and-file members for ratification after about 250 UAW leaders meet to consider the pact on Wednesday in Chicago.
The deal was unanimously approved by the union's national GM bargaining council.
Details of the pact were not released Saturday, but Gerald Knechtel, GM vice president of personnel, said it fits within the pattern that the UAW set at Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp.
Both of those companies agreed to guarantee jobs for 95 percent of their current hourly workforces and will give workers a $2,000 bonus in the first year of the contract, followed by three percent raises in the second and third years of the contract.
Knechtel said GM will depend on its UAW workforce to gain efficiencies over the next three years. The company had been seeking the flexibility to shift more work to lower-cost outside suppliers.
""We feel we have the ability to make competitive improvements in the company. We will need to do that with the UAW,"" he said.
In a sign that contentious issues remain, company and union officials did not announce the pact in a joint news conference with the traditional handshakes and smiles. Instead, they held made grim-faced separate statements to reporters gathered at GM's Detroit headquarters building.
""I think we said back in June that it would be a difficult negotiation, and I think we fulfilled that expectation,"" said a visibly tired GM Chairman Jack Smith. ""Like any negotiation, you never get everything you want.""
The talks were said to hit several snags during the past week over plants that GM wanted to exclude from the 95 percent employment guarantees. Among those were a door hinge plant in Flint, Michigan, and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Michigan, that the company has put on the sale block.
The proposed exceptions to the pattern were aimed at allowing GM, the least efficient of Detroit's Big Three automakers, to cut costs and boost productivity.
Although all three of the companies pay a base wage of about $19 an hour, Ford and Chrysler buy more of their parts from lower-cost outside suppliers than GM does.

697,"The United Auto Workers union is discussing the possibility of an extended five- or six-year contract with the nation's largest automakers, UAW and company officials said Monday.
The union is open to the idea of a contract longer than the typical three-year pact if it offers significant job security guarantees, officials said.
""It has surfaced in the subcommittees,"" said Carl Dowell, president of UAW Local 862 in Louisville, Ky. ""There was no problem with a longer-term agreement if it's fruitful for our people. Job security is the key.""
Contract talks with General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. resumed Monday after meetings late last week between UAW President Stephen Yokich and the automakers' chairmen.
The UAW has not yet chosen which company it will negotiate a pattern agreement with. Yokich said last week that he delayed the union's traditional choice of a ""strike target"" to allow the negotiating progress to continue at all three companies.
A UAW spokesman said no decision on a target company is expected this week.
Traditionally, the target is threatened with a national strike on the contract expiration date if no agreement is reached by then. The current pact, covering about 400,000 U.S. hourly workers at the three automakers, expires September 14.
Ford spokesman Jon Harmon said the automaker suggested to the UAW about three weeks ago that both sides should examine possibly negotiating a longer-term contract.
He said a longer agreement would stabilise Ford's future costs, allowing it to evaluate future product and investment decisions more accurately. ""It gives you more of a known quantity,"" he said.
Yokich has said he would be open to a longer contract if the automakers ""want to buy it.""
However, many UAW officials remain sceptical about a longer-term pact and say that removal of a strike threat every three years could invite abuses by the automakers.
""The question is how can GM live up to a five-year agreement when they can't live up to a three-year agreement?"" said Ed McNulty, president of UAW Local 14 at GM's Toledo, Ohio, truck transmission plant.
Such an agreement would have to provide a mechanism for enforcement of the contract and for revisions to resolve local issues over sourcing and staffing levels that are sure to arise over the life of the contract, he said.
GM has been hit by several strikes at individual plants over the current three-year contract over sourcing and jobs.
""You're going to have to have some good job security and outsourcing provisions for the membership to go for it,"" McNulty said.

703,"An international task force working to resolve the simmering controversy over desirable addresses on the Internet released a draft plan Friday for a substantial expansion of the total number of destinations.
The International Ad Hoc Committee on domain names, formed by the Internet Society in October, recommended that seven new so-called top-level domains be added to the Internet.
Top-level domains are the three-letter designations most Internet sites end with, such as ""com"" in http://www.gm.com and other commercial sites, ""gov"" in government sites and ""edu"" for sites run by schools.
The committee recommended that an unlimited number of firms be authorised to register the new addresses, although the panel said it hoped to initially approve 20 to 30 new registration services.
Addresses for most sites are currently handed out by Network Solutions Inc. of Herndon, Va., which charges $100 for each registration.
At first, Network Solutions would continue to have a monopoly on the domain names it already controls but the committee said its ""ultimate goal"" is to have all names handled by all qualifed firms.
""The IAHC members were faced with a formidable challenge,"" said Donald Heath, president of the Internet Society and chairman of the committee. ""We accomplished our goal, in no small part, because we were able to bring people together from around the world, via the Internet.""
The full text of the recommendations was posted on the Internet at http://www.iahc.org, Heath said. The proposal will be open for public comment until Jan. 17 and a final report is expected by Feb. 3.
New names and competing registration services should help quell disputes over popular or trademarked names.
Disputes are arising more frequently, usually when the holder of a trademark discovers that someone else is using their trademark as the name of an Internet site.
For example, Viacom Inc.'s MTV music channel fought with one of its employees, who had registered ""mtv.com,"" eventually regaining control of the name in an out-of-court settlement.
In another case, a journalist tweaked McDonald's Corp. by registering ""mcdonalds.com"" before the fast-food giant did and before the Web had attained its current prominence. The address now belongs to McDonald's.
Once new top-level domain names are available, 10 people or organisations could register similar names. The new top-level domains will contain three to five letters but have not yet been selected.
The committee included members from the Internet Society, which helps coordinate and develop Net standards; the Internet Assigned Number Authority, which oversees certain of the standards, and the Internet Architecture Board, which helps draft and promulgate new technical standards.
The committee also included representatives from the International Telecommunications Union, the World Intellectual Property Organisation and the International Trademark Association.
",AaronPressman,1
706,"An international Internet group released its plan Wednesday to dramatically increase the number of available addresses in cyberspace while quelling disputes over the use of trademarks in those address names.
The International Ad Hoc Committee, which includes members of Internet standards-setting bodies and legal and communications experts, proposed seven new ""top-level domains,"" the last block of letters at the end of every Internet address.
If the plan is adopted, Net surfers will see addresses ending in ""web"", ""store"", ""info"", ""firm"", ""arts"", ""rec"" and ""nom"", joining ""com"", ""edu"", ""gov"" and other existing top-level domains.
Each new domain reflects a particular type or category of Internet site. For example, ""rec"" would be for sites emphasising recreation and entertainment, while ""nom"" would be for those desiring individual or personal nomenclature.
In drafting the plan, the group received more than 4,000 comments from around the world. The consensus-building approach followed an outcry that arose when a few Internet bodies unveiled a similiar plan last August.
""We are very pleased with the acceptance and broad consensus that we have achieved in this process,"" said Donald Heath, president of the Internet Society and chair of the ad hoc committee. ""To attain its fullest potential, the Internet requires true self-governance.""
Heath said the plan should be approved by Internet standard setters within a few weeks, allowing new domains to come online about three months later.
The plan includes provisions to resolve disputes arising over the use of trademarked names as Internet addresses.
Last year, for example, toymaker Hasbro Inc. won a lawsuit to regain control of the Internet address ""candyland.com,"" which was being used for an adult Web site with nude photographs.
But more complex disputes are arising where both parties may have a legitimate claim to an Internet address.
Under the committee plan, anyone applying for an Internet address will have to agree to resolve disputes through online mediation under the rules of the World Intellectual Property Organisation. Mediation will be provided by panels composed of international experts on intellectual property, trademarks and the Net. Challenges initiated within 60 days of an address registration would be resolved within 30 days.
All challenges and proposed decisions would be made public and time allowed for comment before a final decision was rendered.
The plan will not completely eliminate court battles, attorneys said. ""It's much better than the policies we've seen in the past, but, just by the nature of how valuable these domains have become, litigation will continue,"" said Paul Terry, Internet law specialist at Winthrop, Stimson, Putnam &amp; Roberts.
The plan also calls for establishing up to 28 competing registration firms to dole out the new addresses. The firms will operate under the auspices of a Council of Registrars, to be established as a non-profit association in Switzerland.
Currently, one firm, Herndon, Va.-based Network Solutions Inc., hands out addresses in the most popular domains, charging $100 for a two-year registration.
Network Solutions, which registers over 80,000 new Internet addresses a month, had no comment on the plan, but a spokesman raised doubts about its viability. ""We're concerned with the stability and integrity of the registration process,"" spokesman Christopher Clough said.
The complete proposal is posted on the World Wide Web at http://www.iahc.org/draft-iahc-recommend-00.html.

708,"A U.S. District Court judge Wednesday barred new federal regulations that allow credit unions to expand their membership beyond workers at one company, saying this would exceed the legal limits of the institutions.
The rules have raised the ire of banks who, fearing the loss of customers, have been battling in court since 1990 to keep credit unions to their traditional role of serving members of just ""one"" community or occupation.
The new rules, which the National Credit Union Administration adopted last month after an unfavorable court ruling, redefined ""a single common bond"" that is the basis of credit union membership.
On Wednesday, Judge Thomas Jackson issued an injunction blocking the new rules, saying they were merely an attempt to circumvent earlier court rulings.
Earlier court rulings limited members of a credit union to a single company or organization. The court actions struck down a 1982 NCUA decision allowing credit unions to draw members from multiple companies.
Under the latest NCUA rules, credit unions could include members of a single trade, industry or profession even if the members worked for different companies.
Jackson chastised the NCUA and said the federal credit union regulator was acting more like a trade association.
Jackson also said the agency must rescind 31 applications that it had already approved for credit union charters under the new rules.
The judge said he might refer the matter to the attorney general for further investigation of what he termed collusive behavior among the agency and credit unions.
""Why did you go about it in such a surreptitious, collusive, underhanded way?"" Jackson asked lawyers for the agency at a hearing Wednesday.
Eric Goulian, a lawyer for the Justice Department, denied the agency had acted improperly and said the new rules were a response to emergency conditions.
The fireworks were the latest development in a six-year-old case before Jackson pitting the American Bankers Association against the agency and the credit union industry.
In 1990, the ABA and five North Carolina banks filed suit againt AT&amp;T Family Federal Credit Union, which had grown to encompass members from more than 150 different occupational groups.
In July, a U.S. Court of Appeals handed the banks a major victory in the case, ruling that the NCUA had exceeded its statutory authority in allowing single credit unions each to serve members of more than one employer.
Jackson issued injunctions in October implementing the ruling. The injunctions limited more than 3,500 non-profit credit unions nationwide to members who share a ""single common bond.""
The credit union industry has said the injunctions will result in millions of people being expelled from credit unions, with some unable to afford similiar but more expensive services from banks.
Two weeks after Jackson issued the injunctions, the credit union agency adopted new rules, now set aside, to dramatically expand the definition of a single common bond.
The new rules also allowed credit unions to have as many as 1 million members, up from 25,000 under the old rules.
After the hearing, Brenda Furlow, general counsel for the Credit Union National Association, said the industry was considering an appeal.
""Clearly, we're disappointed with the ruling,"" she said. ""Basically, banks are trying to aggressively protect their competitive interests and the American consumer loses.""
Paul Schosberg, president of the trade association America's Community Bankers, praised Jackson's ruling. ""The NCUA has clearly stretched the law's common bond requirement beyond all recognition,"" he said.

713,"The debate over reforming America's financial services sector, a top priority for Congress and the Clinton administration, began in earnest Tuesday.
As major industry representatives sat down at a House Banking subcommitee hearing on two pending reform bills, word came that Senate Banking Committee Chairman Alfonse D'Amato, R.-N.Y., had introduced his own version of comprehensive reform.
The bills introduced so far, as well as an administration proposal expected late next month, begin with the same premise: the time is right to scrap the Glass-Steagall Act enacted during the Depression to separate banking from other financial activities like securities underwriting and insurance.
Most in Congress agree. And, for the first time, most financial service company seem to agree as well.
At the hearing of the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions, representatives of banking, insurance, securities and mutual funds all agreed Congress should allow a single entity to span all financial services businesses.
But, as subcommittee Chairwoman Marge Roukema, a New Jersey Republican, observed, ""The devil is in the details.""
Those who had opposed tearing down Glass-Steagall, mainly insurance and securities companies, have seen federal courts and regulators slowly roll back the law -- but only for banks.
Last March, the Supreme Court freed banks from many state insurance restrictions.
The Federal Reserve also decided to allow banks to derive up to 25 percent of a subsidiary's revenue from securities activity, an increase from the previous limit of 10 percent. In November, the comptroller of the currency said he would start allowing national banks to enter a host of non-banking businesses.
Banks got substantial new authority, but others got nothing.
""For too long, important policy issues have been addressed by regulatory agencies or the courts rather than by Congress,"" Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. Vice President Roy Albertalli testified at the hearing. Albertalli spoke on behalf of the American Council of Life Insurance, which had opposed mixing banks and insurance.
All the proposals before Congress would level the playing field to some degree and recognise the changes that have shaken modern finance.
""This banking reform legislation will reform the current patchwork of laws and allow the market to operate freely within the financial services industry,"" D'Amato said as he introduced his bill.
While a broad consensus has been achieved, several important issues remain to be addressed. Perhaps the most controversial is the extent to which non-financial companies should be allowed to own or be owned by financial companies.
Under existing law, mutual funds, insurance companies and savings and loans can combine with so-called commercial firms while banks cannot.
Smaller banks and consumer groups staunchly oppose mixing the two, which would be permitted under the D'Amato bill, limited under the Roukema bill and forbidden under a bill introduced by House Banking Chairman Jim Leach, R.-Iowa.
Joseph Bracewell of the Indepedent Bankers Association of America laid out the opposition. Citing former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, Bracewell said such mergers could ""distort lending decisions, be anticompetitive and threaten the safety and soundness of the banking system.
Banks said they could live with Roukema's compromise approach, but were undecided about the D'Amato plan. Others heartily endorsed the unlimited approach.
Mutual funds have been ""knee-deep in affiliations"" and ""they've never proved a problem in 57 years,"" said Matt Fink, president of the Investment Company Institute.
Differences also remain regarding regulation of new, diversified financial services companies, although most favoured an approach having various, specialised agencies regulate the relevent portion of each firm's activities.

720,"The Internet could provide a huge boost to the U.S. economy if the federal government pursues ""free market"" policies in cyberspace, a group of President Clinton's top advisers says in a draft report obtained by Reuters.
The group, an interagency task force headed by senior presidential adviser Ira Magaziner, recommended that the administration work globally to protect the Internet from new taxes, censorship and other onerous forms of regulation.
After seven months of deliberations, the task force is preparing to issue for public comment a report of principles and policies the Unites States should pursue, Magaziner said in an interview.
""One of the things we're trying to do with this paper is as much say what government should not do as say what they should do,"" Magaziner said. ""A lot of what industry is concerned about is that governments are already beginning to take actions around the world that would inhibit commerce.""
The growth of Internet commerce could help boost U.S. exports of everything from movies and news to software and consulting services. Exports of such products totalled $40 billion in 1995, the draft report noted.
The idea is to hitch U.S. exports to the speeding Internet commerce train. Sales of goods and services online are projected to grow to $7 billion in the year 2000, from about $1 billion this year, according to market researchers at Jupiter Communications.
""Companies have told us there would be a tremendous potential to increase world trade across the Internet if we could provide the right kind of environment,"" Magaziner said.
The draft report, called ""A Framework for Global Electronic Commerce,"" covers nine issues, from taxation and customs to privacy and security.
On taxation, the draft report echoes a report issued by the Treasury Department last month by stating no new taxes should be imposed. Acting through the World Trade Organisation, the United States should push for the Internet to be designated a duty-free zone, the draft said.
Some consumers worry that their privacy will be violated when they shop online. The report said governments should push vendors to disclose what will be done with information about consumers rather than dictate to merchants what they can or cannot do with the data.
On some issues, such as encryption -- encoding information in a scrambled format to provide a measure of security or privacy -- existing administration policies may be seen as conflicting with the free market approach of the draft report.
Magaziner said policies will evolve over time, ""but the paper will reflect where we are now.""
Magaziner headed Clinton's failed effort to reform the U.S. health care system, an initiative critics said favoured government over the private sector.
While disagreeing with his critics' characterisation of the health care plan, Magaziner said the Internet ""is a wholly different animal.
""I'm a problem solver, not an ideologue,"" he said.

724,"Several U.S. legislators are planning to introduce measures soon to relax export restrictions on encryption technology, an increasingly essential part of global communications and online commerce.
Last year, the Clinton administration relaxed some of the Cold War era export limits on the technology, specialized computer programs that scramble data and render it unreadable without a password or software ""key.""
But computer companies said the administration did not go far enough, locking them out of the growing global market.  
Rep. Bob Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, plans to reintroduce a bill on Wednesday that would go well beyond the Clinton administration's approach, staff people in his office said.
Goodlatte's bill would allow computer companies like Netscape Communications Corp or Microsoft Corp to export products with powerful encryption features if foreign competitors were selling similiar technology.
In the Senate, Montana Republican Sen Conrad Burns is also planning to reintroduce his encryption bill from last year.  
At an informal gathering of the Congressional Internet Caucus Tuesday night, Burns said he expected to put forth the bill, known by the acronym PRO-CODE, in late February.
At one time, the Senator had said the 1997 bill would be identical to last year's bill which did not get a vote in the Commerce Committee.  But staffers said the Senator is still tweaking the bill to draw more supporters.
""It's about ready to go,"" Burns said Tuesday night.
Goodlatte's bill, under the jurisdiction of the House Judiciary Committee, had already garnered 54 co-sponsors by Tuesday night.  
Staff said the bill almost had the backing of a majority of the members of the Judiciary Committee.
Others are also considering introducing bills, some seeking a middle approach between the administration and the Burns and Goodlatte bills, which would remove nearly all export restrictions.
Sen. Patrick Leahy, the Vermont Democrat and co-chair of the Internet Caucus, may have a bill and Rep Rick White, Pennsylvania Republican and also co-chair, is considering weighing in, staff people said.
Some lobbyists involved in the debate said that the administration was considering introducing its own legislation.  But they were unsure about the contents of the legislation, since the administration implemented its new policy by a Presidential executive order in November.
Administration officials were not immediately available for comment.

730,"The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, one of the nation's primary regulators of derivatives, has no authority over most foreign currency transactions, the Supreme Court said Tuesday.
In a unanimous decision, the court ruled that a 1974 law exempting some transactions in foreign currency from CFTC oversight also exempted some foreign exchange derivatives, financial instruments whose value is based on the value of currencies like the dollar or Japanese yen.
The CFTC regulates trading of derivatives such as futures and options on everything from wheat and corn to interest rates and electricity. By law, such trading must occur on a recogized exchange, such as the Chicago Board of Trade or the New York Mercantile Exchange.
But when Congress created the commission in 1974, it added an amendment permitting off-exchange trading in foreign currency and a few other items without CFTC regulation. The amendment was requested by the Treasury Department, which believed that the developing market in foreign currency among large banks and securities firms would be overregulated by CFTC oversight.
The CFTC stayed away from the inter-bank foreign exchange market, which has grown to $40 billion a day in total trading. The commission did, however, prosecute small-scale fraudulent foreign exchange investment peddlers, often called ""bucket shops.""
But when the CFTC pursued William Dunn, whose $180 million foreign currency fund lost $95 million in 1993, Dunn argued that the 1974 Treasury amendment should also apply to his trading of foreign exchange options.
On Tuesday, the Supreme Court agreed with the bulk of Dunn's argument.
""We think it plain that foreign currency options are 'transactions in foreign currency' within the plain meaning of the statute,"" Justice John Paul Stevens wrote. ""We are not persuaded by any of the arguments advanced by the CFTC in support of a narrower reading.""
That pleased banks and Wall Street trade groups, which had sided with Dunn. They argued that subjecting their off-exchange foreign exchange trading to CFTC oversight would be too costly, forcing them to shut down U.S. operations and move overseas.
""We're obviously delighted at the result,"" said Ken Raisler, an attorney for several of the trade groups.
""It supports our view that the amendment should be read broadly,"" Raisler, a former general counsel of the CFTC added.
Dunn's lawyer and the banks suggested that any wrongdoing in the foreign exchange area could be dealt with under existing law by other federal agencies, but the Supreme Court did not address the issue. Most off-exchange derivatives trading is not directly regulated, although most participants in such markets are overseen by bank, securities and insurance regulators.
The CFTC still has jurisdiction over foreign currency derivatives traded on an exchange, which include futures contracts. But that market is dwarfed by the over-the-counter market among banks and similiar institutions.
In a lower court case last year, the CFTC argued unsuccessfully that a fraudulent ""bucket shop"" constituted an exchange.
On Tuesday, the commission maintained that the Supreme Court had decided only the narrow issue of whether the Treasury amendment covered options trading.
""While we are disappointed in the outcome of the case, we note that the Supreme Court's opinion was limited to the narrow issue of whether the Treasury amendment treats futures and options the same,"" CFTC general counsel Dan Waldman said. ""The court's decision does not affect the commission's ongoing efforts to police fraud against the public in foreign currency trading.""
Congress is already discussing amending the 1974 Treasury amendment. The Supreme Court's decision ""underlines the need for Congress to make decisions about what financial products should or should not be subject to the CFTC's jurisdiction,"" said Andy Fisher, spokesman for the Senate Agriculture Committee.
Sens. Dick Lugar, R-Ind., Pat Leahy, D-Vt., and Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, introduced a Senate bill to overhaul futures regulation. ""It makes the case to proceed with that bill as quickly as we can,"" Fisher said.
The court invited congressional action. Recognising an ""important public policy dispute"" underlying the case, the court suggested ""these arguments are addressed to the Congress, not the courts.""

731,"Legislators introduced two bills Thursday to overturn the Clinton administration's export limits on computer encryption technology, a key component of online commerce and global communications.
Encryption products, which scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software ""key,"" were once the realm of spies and generals.
But with the booming growth of the Internet, secret coding is now used for everything from keeping a business's e-mail confidential to protecting a consumer's credit card number if it is transmitted online.
Senators said export restrictions on encryption products were hindering the development of the Internet and making it impossible for U.S. companies to compete with foreign firms.
The bills ""roll back current restrictions on the export of strong cryptography so that high-tech U.S. firms are free to compete in the global marketplace and meet the demand of customers,"" Sen. Pat Leahy, a Vermont Democrat and co-sponsor of both bills, said at a Capitol Hill news conference.
""Online commerce will never reach its full potential under the policies of this and past administrations,"" said Sen. Conrad Burns, a Montana Republican , also a co-sponsor.
The bills would generally allow a U.S. company to export a product with strong encryption features if similiar products were being offered for sale by a foreign supplier. Leahy and Burns introduced similiar measures in the last Congress.
Under the current Clinton administration policy, a company may export strong encryption only if the product also includes a feature to allow the U.S. government to crack the code by recovering the software ""key"" when acting under a court order or similiar authority. The administration says it must be able to crack the codes to catch international criminals and terrorists.
If the bills became law, mandatory key recovery would be banned but the government would still be permitted to restrict the export of encryption for military use or to countries posing terrorist threats.
The legislation would also write into law the current policy permitting unrestricted domestic use of encryption -- but one bill would criminalize the use of codes to obstruct justice.
The Clinton administration signalled its displeasure with the new bills.
""We continue to be disappointed with Senator Burns' approach because it does not balance the needs of individual privacy and economic growth with national security and public safety,"" Undersecretary of Commerce William Reinsch said. ""We believe there is a market for key recovery products from businesses who recognise the need for a back door to their own corporate data.""
Computer companies and privacy advocates hailed the bills.
""Both bills promote the freedom of this nation's fastest-growing industry to provide customers here and abroad with products they demand,"" said Robert Holleyman, president of the Business Software Alliance. The group includes Microsoft Corp., International Business Machines Corp.'s Lotus Development and Apple Computer Inc., among others.
""This is the most important privacy legislation before the Congress today,"" said Jerry Berman, executive director of the Centre for Democracy and Technology.
Berman, who strongly opposes mandatory key recovery, said the policy ought to be ""my lock, my key.""

742,"The Clinton administration will modestly revise controversial export rules for computer encoding technology after a private meeting Wednesday with computer and telecommunications companies, a top Commerce Department official said.
""This is a work in progress,"" Under Secretary of Commerce William Reinsch said in a telephone interview after the hour and a half long meeting. ""There will be some changes that will be more than technical.""  
The administration circulated a draft this week of new rules that would overhaul Cold War era export limits on products containing encryption, computer programs that scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software ""key.""
With the growth of the Internet and online commerce, demand for encryption-capable products is growing worldwide. Coded messages can keep a business' e-mail confidential or protect a consumer's credit card number sent on the Internet.
Reinsch and others who attended Wednesday's meeting said the tone was civil.  
""We had a long meeting but it was actually quite a constructive one and actually also a polite one,"" Reinsch said.
Industry officials argued at the meeting that the draft rules were unclear or unworkable on a number of points.
""In some cases we could tell them what we meant which made them feel better and now we'll go off and try to fix it,"" Reinsch acknowledged. ""In other cases we're going to have to think a little more about what they said and in some cases I'm not sure there is a way to fix it.""  
""We are not optimistic that these (rules) will be turned around and we feel going to Congress is our only option,"" Smiroldo said. The alliance includes a dozen large software firms including Microsoft Corp and International Business Machine Corp's Lotus Development.
Several bills that would dramatically ease encryption export limits were introduced in the last Congress and are expected to be revived next year.
Ambassador David Aaron, appointed by President Clinton as special envoy for cryptography last month, also attended the meeting, Reinsch said.
The draft rules implement an executive order signed by President Bill Clinton last month. Under the order, limits on export of products containing strong encryption would be eased if the products allowed the government to decode encrypted messages by recovering the keys.
The draft rules detail for the first time the government's definition of acceptable key recovery features and other aspects of the revised export approval process.
For example, until 1999, companies will be allowed to export some products that do not include key recovery if the companies promise to include key recovery in future products. -- 202-898-8312

744,"U.S. banks will be able to significantly increase their securities underwriting activities under a rule adopted Friday by the Federal Reserve, but that will only add pressure on Congress to overhaul the entire regulatory system, market participants said.
The Fed voted unanimously to allow so-called section 20 subsidiaries of banks to derive as much as 25 percent of their revenues from underwriting and dealing in securities such as stocks, corporate bonds and commercial paper.
The new rule takes effect in 60 days, the Fed said.  
At the meeting, Fed governors called for Congressional action to reform the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act and other laws separating banks from non-bank financial services industries.
""We hope that the next move will be up to the Congress in this whole area,"" Fed vice chair Alice Rivlin said.
""Legislation is needed but I think this is a constructive step and it is appropriate for us to interpret the existing legislation,"" Governor Susan Phillips said.
While the Glass-Steagall Act prohibits banks from engaging in non-bank activity, under section 20 of the Act banks may affiliate with firms not ""engaged principally"" in such areas.  
The Fed said it currently authorizes 41 bank subsidiaries to deal and underwrite securities, ranging from stocks and bonds to commercial paper and mortgage-backed securities.
Banks were already allowed to handle other sorts of financial instruments, including Treasury securities and over-the-counter derivatives.
Both the Fed's action and an even broader move last month by the Comptroller of the Currency will raise the pressure on Congress to scrap the Glass-Steagall Act, according to Robert Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institute.  
In the past, banks led the charge to change the law because they wanted to get into other businesses, like selling insurance and underwriting. Insurance companies and securities firms generally opposed the banks, creating legislative gridlock.
Now, all industries will press for change, Litan said. ""The tables have been turned,"" he said. ""But it's not a two-way street. Other industries will want to level the playing field.""
Banking industry representatives said they were elated by the Fed vote.  
""This is a tremendous boost for banks that already underwrite securities and an incentive for banks considering this business,"" American Bankers Association managing director Larry LaRocca said.
""By lifting the 10 percent revenue cap to 25 percent for Section 20 ineligible securities, the Fed has begun chipping away at the antiquated barriers handicapping banks for years,"" LaRocca added.
Securities industry groups had written to the Fed strongly opposing the proposal and restated their position after the vote.  
""It's as if Santa Clause delivered all the gifts to only one house in the neighborhood,"" Steve Judge, senior vice president for the Securities Industry Association, said.
Judge also called for Congress to act. ""Nothing could benefit consumers and our economy more than a modernization of federal laws governing the financial services industry,"" he said.

746,"The Federal Communications Commission proposed Tuesday to trim the $23 billion a year that long-distance telephone companies pay to local service providers in access fees.
But the commission ducked the contentious issue of whether such charges should be imposed on Internet service providers, asking for comment on the issue without offering any proposals.
In a notice of proposed rule-making, the commission said it could cut the access fees in either of two ways: it could impose a schedule of long-distance access charge reductions or wait to allow market forces to drive fees lower.
The access charges, which make up a substantial portion of local phone company revenues, were adopted after the break-up of AT&amp;T Corp. in 1984 that led to the creation of the regional ""Baby Bell"" local service companies.
New telecommunications rules signed into law in February are supposted to foster more competition for local and long-distance service and drive prices lower.
Long-distance companies, which say the access fees are excessive, favour deep, government-mandated cuts.
""We recommend the FCC to move as quickly as possible to squeeze the $10 billion in excess access fees out of the local exchange industry and put it back in the pockets of consumers,"" AT&amp;T said in a statement.
Local phone companies concede that the fees exceed their actual costs for carrying long-distance calls but would prefer a gradual reduction based on competition and market forces.
The FCC ""must not allow the long-distance companies to continue to benefit at the expense of consumers,"" said Roy Neel, president of the U.S. Telephone Association, which represents local service providers.
While local providers have already cut access fees by $9 billion, ""the long-distance oligopoly has raised rates in lockstep more than six times,"" he said.
Under the FCC's market-based approach, new entrants in the local market would compete with the Baby Bells to connect long-distance calls. The FCC would gradually relax and ultimately remove price caps and access fee schedules while relying on competition to drive the fees down.
The alternate approach would specify the nature and timing of changes in existing rate levels. Ultimately, the FCC said it could adopt parts of both approaches.
Local phone companies also connect Internet users to Internet service providers over local phone lines, but they receive no access charges for those calls.
Recently, several Baby Bells complained that Internet users were getting a free ride, tying up local lines with often lengthy calls.
The FCC did not take a position on whether Internet service providers should be required to pay access fees. In a less formal ""notice of inquiry,"" the agency asked for comment on possible reform ""relating to interstate information services and the Internet.""
Comments are due by Jan. 27 on the long-distance access fee proposals and by Feb. 21 on the Internet issue.

747,"When a company in California sells a book to a consumer in Canada from a Web site hosted on a computer in England, what laws govern the transaction?
As sales of all kinds of goods over the Internet continue to grow, questions are multiplying about basic regulations covering consumer protection, taxation and other issues.
""Most commercial law has built in a hidden assumption of geographical boundaries within which certain kinds of actions will occur,"" said Jerry Kaplan, who runs an Internet site called OnSale that auctions electronic merchandise. ""Now the legal system is facing a medium which is inherently boundary-less.""
For example, some states tax transactions that originate within their borders while others hope to collect so-called use taxes when their residents buy from out-of-state merchants. ""Sin"" laws on obscenity, gambling and sales of alcohol also differ from state to state and apply to some Web merchants.
With the potential for so much confusion, some online mavens argue the federal government should step in and set clear policies.
""The role of the federal government is to set national standards or national policy,"" said Gary Arlen, president of Arlen Communications and a leading analyst of online companies. ""A lot of what we're talking about online transcends state borders and even national borders.""
A top priority is protecting consumers' private information.
""More regulation is really needed on the privacy issues compared to other areas,"" said Jonathan Rosenoer, an attorney and author of the online ""Cyberlaw"" column. Existing laws protect some kinds of records, like medical data, but not other information, Rosenoer said.
Both real and imagined privacy violations are feeding public sentiment in favour of reform. Lexis-Nexis was deluged with protests last month after word spread that the database company was selling personal information such as social security numbers and maiden names over the Internet.
The company responded that its P-TRAK product no longer provided social security numbers and never contained maiden names. But it withdrew the names of thousands of individuals that asked to be deleted.
Following the controversey, the Federal Trade Commission asked Congress to amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act, a law governing personal financial information held by credit agencies. The commission suggested the law be extended to cover nonfinancial information like social security numbers.
In many cases, however, the federal government is still deciding what steps to take.
The Treasury Department, which has a hand in tax policy, banking regulation and international trade, has several groups studying online commerce issues but has not reached any conclusions yet.
Top Treasury officials and banking regulators have expressed a desire not to intrude on the nascent market for electronic money. Some banks would like federal rules barring non-banks from issuing electronic money.
""Heavyhanded, pre-emptive attempts to regulate these products before any social risks have been demonstrated would handicap innovation,"" Federal Reserve Gov. Edward Kelley said earlier this month.
There is little confusion about criminal scheming online, however. The Federal Trade Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission are all prosecuting online crooks and collecting complaints at their Web sites.
""It's not an area where we need new laws or new authority,"" John Stark, special counsel of Internet projects at the SEC said. ""It's the same swindles, just in a different medium.""

758,"Japan is expected to lift controls on stock-related derivatives as part of a drive to free up its financial markets, but industry sources have doubts about whether the products can really take off here.
The securities industry sources said Tokyo was lagging so far behind overseas rivals, including Singapore and Hong Kong, that it would be extremely difficult to make a viable and attractive market for stock-based derivatives in Japan.
On Monday, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto announced a five-year ""Big Bang"" plan to liberalise the nation's markets and catch up with reforms carried out years ago in rival financial centres like London. The aim is to make Japanese markets ""free, fair and global"".
As part of that push, Hashimoto asked for a review of laws relating to derivatives transaction, which currently restrict stock options to those based on indices, rather than on individual stocks.
But even before the ""Big Bang"" announcement, Japan's Ministry of Finance (MOF) had already been looking at lifting restrictions on stock options and equity swap transactions.
A trader at a foreign brokerage said that Japanese participants are already used to offshore trading in derivatives, avoiding the tightly regulated Japanese markets, and it may be hard to generate interest here.
""It is too late to induce market enthusiasm,"" he said. ""Even if the finance ministry deregulates (stock-related) derivatives trading in Japan, it might be difficult to make Tokyo markets attractive,"" he said.
An official at the ministry told Reuters recently that it plans to decide whether to allow the introduction of a variety of stock-related derivatives transactions after an advisory panel delivers its recommendations next spring.
While Japan introduced stock index futures and options in the late 1980s, the ministry has taken a particularly cautious approach to derivatives of individual stocks in order to concentrate equity-related deals on stock exchanges.
Options, which are usually used to hedge against losses due to price fluctuations, allow the holder to buy or sell a specified amount at an agreed price during a set time period.
An analyst at a big brokerage said that the securities industry and the Osaka and Tokyo stock exchanges have made preparations to list individual stock options and are ready to start as soon as the ministry gives the go-ahead.
Such options on individual stocks were introduced in the early 1970s in the U.S. and European markets.
Big Japanese brokers also want to offer stock options which can be traded directly between investors and traders without any stock exchange involvement, he said.
Up until now, trading of individual stock options and equity swap transactions was banned as this was judged to violate the Criminal Code outlawing gambling.
This has pushed lucrative business offshore to less regulated markets, where brokers are able to trade options or warrants based on Japanese stocks if they wish. Market sources say Japan may have to revise the law to clear the way for such derivatives trade.

760,"Japan's financial industry suffered another blow on Tuesday when a court was asked to start bankruptcy proceedings against a major realtor which has estimated liabilities of almost $5.5 billion.
But analysts said that while the collapse of Osaka-based Sueno Kosan could affect some individual financial institutions, it was unlikely to have any major negative impact on the overall financial industry.
The Housing Loan Administration Corp (HLAC), a semi-governmental body set up to collect problem loans run up by seven failed mortgage companies, said on Tuesday it had asked the Osaka District Court to start bankruptcy proceedings against Sueno Kosan and two of its affiliates.
If Sueno Kosan, an unlisted real estate company which borrowed heavily from the ""jusen"" mortgage firms, is declared bankrupt, it could become one of Japan's biggest ever business failures, analysts said.
The HLAC said it has claims totalling 347 billion yen ($3.07 billion) on Sueno Kosan and the two units. The claims were transferred from the failed jusen firms to the body.
In total, Sueno Kosan group's liabilities are estimated at 620 billion yen ($5.48 billion), said Tokyo Commerce and Industry Research Co, a private credit research body.
Japan's banking industry was also jolted last month when a major financing company, Nichiei Finance Co Ltd, filed for liquidation with huge debt liabilities. Like the jusen and Sueno Kosan, Nichiei was a casualty of the property-related lending boom in the late 1980s ""bubble era"" and the subsequent dive in asset prices.
The Osaka court has taken steps to seize the assets of Sueno Kosan and its affiliates in response to the application, the HLAC statement said. There was no immediate comment from Sueno Kosan on the moves.
Although the overall damage to the financial system may be slight, analysts said individual non-bank financial institutions with outstanding loans to Sueno could suffer. A non-bank financial institution makes loans but does not take deposits, raising funds by borrowing from banks.
""Should Sueno be forced into bankruptcy and its assets distributed, many of the other lender non-banks will be forced to absorb huge losses relative to their size,"" said James Fiorillo, ING Baring Securities (Japan) analyst.
""This will probably force many of them (creditors) into distress or bankruptcy, so the outcome...should be closely watched,"" he said.
Finance Minister Wataru Kubo did not appear to be that worried, although he told reporters the Sueno Kosan problem might spread to financial firms that had lent it money.
""However, such an impact will be resolved among related financial institutions in accordance with our financial system,"" he said.
Noboru Matsuda, governor of the Deposit Insurance Corp of Japan (DIC), which supervises the HLAC, said in a statement that it was inevitable such action would be taken against some ""malignant"" borrowers like Sueno, which he said had repeatedly attempted to hide assets.
In June, Japan adopted a controversial plan that allowed for the use of 685 billion yen ($6.06 billion) in public funds to help wind up the jusen.
The HLAC inherited assets totalling 6.5 trillion yen ($57.5 billion) from the failed firms after 6.4 trillion yen ($56.6 billion) worth of unrecoverable loans were written off with the help of financial institutions and public money. ($1=113 yen)

763,"Japan's depressed real estate market is unlikely to get much immediate help for its problems despite market euphoria over possible state purchases of land once owned by troubled financial firms, analysts said.
Tokyo's key stock index surged on Thursday, led by property-related issues, after a newspaper report saying the government was considering using public funds to buy collateralised land formerly owned by failed mortgage firms and other troubled financial firms.
The index, the Nikkei 225, ended up 2.43 percent at 19,051.71, its first close above 19,000 points for more than a month.
A Finance Ministry official told Reuters a government panel was considering using funds already set aside in the next state budget to buy land formerly owned by troubled financial firms.
Vice Finance Minister Tadashi Ogawa later confirmed the possibility, telling a news conference it was possible public-sector firms may purchase such land.
He said the plan would help ease the liquidity crisis affecting real estate.
A government panel, whose members include officials from the ministries of finance, construction and justice and the National Land Agency, was set up last October to tackle the tough issue of collecting problem loans for which land is being held as collateral.
At present, firms cannot afford to sell at market levels since they would realise their huge losses caused by the collapse of the ""bubble"" economy early this decade.
This has led to stagnation in the real estate market and kept the massive problem hanging over the whole financial sector.
""The panel has been discussing how to increase liquidity in the real estate market to facilitate collection of such problem loans,"" said an official at a bank involved in the discussions.
""But we have not talked about any details yet.""
However, he said that if the government decided to buy such collateralised land, it would have a positive impact since the private sector remained reluctant to buy land.
Jesper Koll, an economist at JP Morgan Securities Asia, said public land buying was not a new initiative and no new funds were likely to be allocated for the purchases.
However, he said that more important than any public purchases was Hashimoto's promise to speed up the process of turning real estate into equity assets.
""The faster banks and real estate companies are allowed to securitise property assets, the greater their prospects for increased income generation,"" he said. ""Prime Minister Hashimoto is getting serious about fixing Japan's real estate problem sooner, not later.""
Yoshinobu Yamada, a financial analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc, said that while the move by the government panel on land was not a new initiative, it would have a positive impact in the long-term.
""The government is well aware that it must take steps to stop falling land prices,"" he said, adding that a lack of land liquidity was at the core of Japan's bad-loan mess.
""If the government buys collateralised land formerly owned by jusen, this is likely to give psychological support to the the real estate markets and help the markets bottom out.""
However, he said no concrete policy steps would be available until March so that the current euphoria on the Tokyo's stock market could be only a passing fancy.

766,"Seven of Japan's eight biggest life insurers said on Wednesday that they experienced a drop in assets in the first half of the current fiscal year, the first such fall in many years.
Executives attributed the decline to a cancellation of pension fund management contracts after the firms cut their guaranteed rate of return in April.
""It was the first time we have seen a drop in assets since we started announcing our interim business reports (six years ago),"" said Taichi Ohtaki, managing director of Asahi Mutual Life Insurance Co. ""It would probably be the first time we have experienced a decline in our assets since World War Two.""
Combined assets at the eight firms totalled 142.8 trillion yen ($1.26 trillion) at the end of September, down 1.2 percent from 144.6 trillion yen ($1.27 trillion) at the end of March.
Only Nippon Life Insurance Co, the biggest life insurer in Japan, increased its assets -- to 39.44 trillion yen ($349 billion) from 39.03 trillion yen ($345 billion).
The other firms are Meiji Life Insurance, Sumitomo Life Insurance, Dai-ichi Mutual Life Insurance, Mitsui Mutual Life Insurance, Yasuda Mutual Life Insurance and Chiyoda Mutual Life Insurance.
Assets of the eight account for about 75 percent of the total assets held by all Japanese life insurers.
The executives said that some corporate pension funds and the Pension Welfare Service Public Corp (PWSPC) -- an affiliate of the Welfare Ministry -- had cancelled fund management contracts in the first half of 1996/97, due to a cutback in the guaranteed rate of return offered by life insurers to 2.5 percent from 4.5 percent.
The PWSPC said earlier this year that it had cancelled about five trillion yen ($44.2 billion) worth of fund management contracts with 18 life insurers.
However, some insurers were optimistic and said the decline in assets was only a temporary phenomenon.
""I think the cancellation of pension funds peaked out in the first half and assets at the end of next March will likely recover to the same level as at the end of last fiscal year,"" said Minoru Mochida, senior managing director at Meiji Life.
Analysts said that despite the decline in assets, the profitability of the insurers was improving.
A serious headache for the insurers has been the negative spread between current low investment yields and already promised payouts, they said. Since the cancellation of pension fund management contracts, the gap has been narrowing.
The payouts are calculated based on prospective investment yields at the time insurance policies were written.
Meiji Life's Mochida said the overall average guaranteed rate of return offered by life insurers would fall to about four percent in 1996/97 from about five percent in 1995/96, while investment yields would remain low at around three percent.
The eight firms also announced a combined 2.15 trillion yen ($19.0 billion) of problem loans as of the end of September, the first time they had revealed such statistics.
They said that at the end of September the amount of this total classified as ""bad loans"" -- loans to bankrupt companies and those on which interest payments are in arrears of six months or more -- was 1.06 trillion yen ($9.3 billion).
An official at Sumitomo Life said the firm would this fiscal year dispose of about 500 billion yen ($4.42 billion) of problem loans made to its non-bank affiliates in an effort to cut them back to a manageable level. At the end of September Sumitomo had 789.9 billion yen ($6.99 billion) of problem loans, more than any of the eight insurers. ($1=113 yen)

775,"The introduction of new accounting methods for Japanese banks will not have an immediate impact on their earnings, but it should help boost derivatives trading in Japan, analysts and banking sources say.
Major banks are preparing for the new accounting methods for derivatives and securities trade, which will be introduced from the end of the 1997/98 fiscal year, although the types of financial instruments to be covered by the new methods have not been set.
But the sources said the use of mark-to-market accounting would help increase arbitrage deals in derivatives while also helping reduce potential volatility in swap rates.
""Following the introduction of mark-to-market accounting, we will be able to offer various hedge instruments to clients, and this will help increase business opportunities for us in the long term,"" a bank official said.
In mark-to-market accounting, unrealised gains or losses in the trading accounts must be included in the current income statement.  
Currently in Japan, financial products are basically appraised according to the cost of purchase, and realised gains or losses are posted in current income statements only when the positions are closed.
One analyst said the new accounting methods would not be used for interest rate swaps for long-term holdings.
""Big commercial and trust banks posted bigger operating profitS 1995/96 as they increased profits from interest rate swaps,"" she said.
Even if the big banks take speculative positions in interest rate swaps, the deals are not expected to be covered by the mark-to-market accounting methods as they are not considered as instruments for short-term capital gains, she said.
Naruaki Sonoda, a senior analyst at Nikko Research Centre, said mark-to-market accounting standards would be applied only to short-term trading and banks do not hold shares for that purpose despite their huge stock investments.
Also, unrealised profits or losses in short-term bond dealings are not big enough to influence bank earnings, he said.  
The Japanese parliament passed a special act in June allowing banks and brokerages to include gains or losses from derivatives and short-term securities trading in their income statements from the end of March 1998.
To use mark-to-market accounting methods, however, banks and brokerages must get permission from the Finance Ministry. Not all banks are expected to apply to use the new methods.
A Finance Ministry official said the ministry has been working out details of which securities and derivatives deals will be covered by the new accounting methods.
Deciding which deals go into the trading account will be based on the initial purpose -- whether the deal was aimed at long-term holding or short-term trading, said Takashi Kinoshita, deputy general manager at Fuji Bank's capital markets trading division.
""We are trying to separate trading accounts from non-trading accounts based on business units,"" he said.
Each bank will divide its financial products holdings into two accounts -- one account for hedging risks in holdings of underlying cash instruments and for long-term investments, and the other for short-term operations, the sources said.

778,"An influential Japanese government panel on Thursday called for a fundamental change in the nation's land policies, arguing that the old concept of trying to hold down land values was out of date.
Real estate values have plummeted since the bursting in the early 1990s of Japan's ""bubble"" of inflated asset prices.
The panel called for an ""appropriate"" tax on landholdings in line with balanced assessments of value.
To promote more liquidity in real estate holdings it recommended securitisation and promotion of joint ventures.
It also called for steps to encourage small landowners to sell their land or cooperate in development projects in order for large-scale development to take place in big cities.
Analysts and real estate industry sources said, however, that the panel failed to make specific proposals that would help end the long slump in the real estate market.
""Nobody in the government or politicians have yet formed a clear policy to solve the slump in the real estate market and falling land prices,"" said a real estate industry source.
Some experts said a change in taxation is the most important step that needs to be taken.
""While the panel makes wide-ranging proposals, it is somewhat disappointing that the panel did not make specific proposals on taxes on land (holdings and transactions),"" said Keiko Otsuki, a senior analyst at UBS Securities Ltd.
It is Japan's first review of land policy in five years.
The panel said in its proposals to Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto that land prices had fallen to a point where the price surges in the latter half of the bubble had been offset after a five-year slump.
Emergency intervention measures to curb land prices adopted in 1991 are no longer needed as they are still falling, it said.
Banks and non-bank financial institutions have been reeling from property-related bad loans, a factor blocking a smooth supply of funds to the real estate market and strong economic recovery.
The proposals follow a request by Hashimoto in April for a review of Japan's land policy to cope with structural changes such as falling land prices, growing numbers of people leaving the Tokyo metropolitan area and a rapid rise in the proportion of old people in the population.

779,"Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto unveiled plans Monday for a five-year ""Big Bang"" to liberalise Japan's financial markets and catch up with reforms carried out more than a decade ago in Europe and North America.
Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka told reporters the three main pillars of the reforms would be to make markets ""free, fair and global"" by the year 2001.
The moves would end fixed commissions for stockbrokers, increase the release of financial information and allow banks, securities houses and insurance companies to enter each others' now-protected areas.
""This is going to be Tokyo's 'Big Bang,'"" Mitsuzuka said, referring to British financial reforms in 1986, which removed a myriad of barriers in the financial industry.
Analysts welcomed the move to sweep away rules that date back to the end of World War II, saying that Japan must reform in order to stop its slide as a world financial centre.
""Japanese banks and securities houses are left behind U.S. institutions in financial expertise and innovation,"" said Ken Okamura, strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson (Asia) Ltd.
Tight regulation in Japan's financial markets has only pushed lucrative business offshore to less regulated markets, he said.
Hashimoto formed a new Cabinet Thursday made up solely of Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) lawmakers, the first time the conservative, pro-business party has ruled on its own since being booted out of power in 1993.
Some pundits have wondered how serious Hashimoto and the LDP are about drastic deregulation, although others say the politically astute prime minister is well aware of the need to open Japanese markets to competition to ensure the economy flourishes in the 21st century.
""This is a very good objective, but getting there is going to be extremely difficult,"" said Brian Waterhouse, a James Capel Pacific analyst.
The securities industry is expected to be the hardest hit by the changes, and the nation's big banks are expected to face some bloodletting as well.
The reforms would bring Tokyo into line with rival centres in Europe and the United States, where liberalisation began in the 1960s and culminated in London's ""Big Bang.""
""We think this is the last opportunity to revitalise Tokyo's financial markets,"" a Finance Ministry official told reporters.
Here are the main points of the financial reform plansL:
To create freer markets:
-- Banks, securities houses and insurance companies should be allowed to enter each others' business areas.
-- Banks and other financial institutions should be allowed to deal in more products in a bid to meet investors' wide range of needs.
-- Japan will look into the liberalisation of financial market commission fees.
-- Participation in foreign exchange transactions, currently limited to banks authorised by the government, should be liberalised.
-- Considering the effective use of individual savings, which now total 1,200 trillion yen ($10.81 trillion).
To create fairer markets:
-- Financial institutions should be required to make satisfactory disclosure of information to investors and depositors and clarify relevant rules to make market participants responsible for their investment.
-- Market participants will be more severely punished if they violate the rules regarding their involvement in the markets.
To createe more internationalized markets:
-- Investment in financial derivatives -- securities derived from simpler financial instruments -- should be promoted in Japan by revising Japan's accounting system and relevant laws to meet global standards.
-- A supervisory system on a global scale should be established. The Group of Seven (G7) industrialised nations is working on setting up up such a system. ($1=111 yen)

782,"More Japanese finance firms braced for the bitter pill of court-protected liquidation on Thursday, but analysts said Japan's banking sector still faces a long road to recovery from its bad loan headaches.
The announcements were no surprise and more were considered likely as the banking sector struggles to get rid of troubled finance firms and regain its credibility.
The collapses highlighted, however, the growing worries that unexpected bad news may lie ahead and that Japan's slumping stock market could set back the recuperation further.
The latest victims were All Corp, with debts on borrowings worth 274.5 billion yen ($2.36 billion), Sanwa Tatemono Sogo Finance Co with debts of 66.4 billion yen ($572 million) and CS Sogo Service with debts of 71.3 billion yen ($614 million).
Ubumi Sagara, president of Tokyo-based non-bank All Corp, told reporters the firm would hold a shareholders' meeting by the end of March to seek approval for a liquidation filing.
The firm's major creditor banks -- Tokai Bank Ltd, Sakura Bank Ltd and Chuo Trust Banking &amp; Co Ltd -- were accepting its special liquidation plan, he said.
All Corp's cumulative debt exceeded its assets by 195.4 billion yen ($1.68 billion) as of September 1996 and it would be hard to improve its business despite recent restructuring efforts, he said.
""All Corp has been well-known as a troubled non-bank,"" said Yoshinobu Yamada, a financial analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan.
""Main creditor banks have already set aside loan loss provisions to prepare for the failure and the liquidation will have no major impact on earnings of those banks,"" he said.
Japan had at least five non-bank failures in 1996, including the collapse of Nichiei Finance Co, which filed for liquidation with debt liabilities of around one trillion yen ($8.6 billion). By one measure, this made Nichiei the largest such insolvency case in Japan in the postwar period.
Katsuhito Sasajima, an analyst at Nikko Research Centre, said banks in general have been well-prepared for possible failures of non-bank companies in recent years.
Banks are major lenders to non-bank institutions, which do not take deposits and largely depend on bank loans as sources of funds for their own lending.
""All Corp is not the end of the problem loan mess at credit firms and people know that. Rather, worries have grown that banks may have to write off bigger problem loans to general contractors than earlier expected,"" Sasajima said.
A new restructuring programme unveiled late last year by Tobishima Corp, a contractor and engineering company, fuelled concerns that banks would face new burdens as ailing firms seek added support in attempting to reshape themselves, he said.
The failures at Sanwa Tatemono Sogo Finance and CS Sogo Service were not surprising, either, as the two firms were subsidiaries of failed parent companies, banking sources said.
Banking sources said that while the impact of All Corp's liquidation would be limited, they were much more concerned about jitters in the Tokyo stock market. The closely watched Nikkei average lost about 11 percent of its value last week.
Declining stock prices whittle away unrealised profits from banks' shareholdings, reducing the amount of money available to write off problem loans and thus protracting the mess in the banking industry, they said. ($1=116 yen)

784,"One year after its dramatic expulsion from the United States, scandal-hit Daiwa Bank is finding its misfortune may in some ways have been a blessing in disguise, analysts say.
The painful fall-out from its $1.1 billion bond-trading loss in the United States, they say, forced the bank to take some of the bitter but necessary restructuring measures that other Japanese banks have been reluctant to swallow.
""Following its expulsion from the United States and inspections by Japan""s Finance Ministry and the Bank of Japan, Daiwa was able to eliminate management risks from its corporate structure,"" said Yukiko Ohara, a financial analyst at UBS Securities Ltd.
""It (Daiwa) could be a model for restructuring at other banks, which still lack a sense of crisis despite the recent fall in their share prices,"" she said.
By the end of March, 2000, Daiwa""s restructuring efforts are likely to help boost its annual operating profits above 100 billion yen ($800 million), despite the negative impact of asset reductions overseas, Ohara said. In the year to March 1997 Daiwa forecast operating profits of 80 billion yen ($640 million).
A Daiwa official agreed that the harm done by the bond-loss scandal was not as great as initially expected.
""We feared that we might suffer substantial damage from the withdrawal from U.S. markets,"" Daiwa bank director Akiyoshi Otani told Reuters in a recent interview. ""But the damage was not great.... Our customers stayed calm and have been supporting us.""
""The strategies we have taken (since the withdrawal from the United States) have not been wrong,"" he added.
In November 1995, two months after news broke that a Daiwa trader in New York lost $1.1 billion on unauthorised deals, U.S. bank regulatory authorities ordered Daiwa to shut down its U.S. operations. Daiwa pleaded guilty to charges including conspiracy and fraud and paid a record $340 million in fines.
Japan""s Finance Ministry also placed temporary restrictions on Daiwa""s operations and ordered the institution, Japan""s ninth largest commercial bank, to work out a drastic streamlining programme.
Last April, Daiwa announced a two-year plan to focus on its three strengths: the Kansai area around Osaka in western Japan, where it has a strong customer base, the Asian market, and the trust business, which includes pension fund management. Daiwa manages more pension fund money than any other Japanese bank.
It also decided to shut about 36 offices, including 16 overseas, by March 1999, and by the end of last September had cut its assets to 16.30 trillion yen ($130 billion) from 19.36 trillion yen ($154 billion) a year earlier. Daiwa also plans to reduce the number of its employees by about 2,000 by March 2000, from 9,151 last September.
But some analysts insisted the bank""s restructuring had not gone far enough, noting it was still saddled with 790 billion yen ($6.32 billion) in problem loans, or 7.4 percent of loans outstanding, as of last September.
Yushiro Ikuyo, first vice president at Smith Barney International Inc""s Tokyo branch, added that the expulsion from the United States was bound to damage Daiwa""s future business.
""I doubt whether Daiwa can continue to manage its international business without U.S. operations,"" he said. ""The business environment surrounding Japanese banks will become much tougher and Daiwa must make extra efforts to streamline its business, even halving its assets.""
Several analysts have suggested that Daiwa""s woes may force it to combine with another financial institution. Last month, Moody""s Investors Service said Daiwa Bank and Nomura Securities, its largest shareholder, may join under the same holding company.
But Daiwa""s Otani dismissed such talk for now.

785,"Faced with persistent market rumours that it is on the verge of collapse, Nippon Credit Bank Ltd went public on Wednesday to say that any such talk is ""totally groundless"".
""In the markets, unsourced rumours such as the suggestion that our bank is practically on the verge of collapse are circulating and are prompting sales of our shares and debentures,"" NCB vice president Shoji Nishikawa told a hastily convened news conference.
""Such rumours are totally groundless and our bank would like to declare that these rumours are not true,"" he said.
Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka also came out in support of long-suffering Nippon Credit, whose failure could spark a crisis in the banking industry.
He said the government will fully support the bank, although he added that the ministry is not worried about the financial health of Nippon Credit, the smallest of the nation's three long-term credit banks.
""The ministry has had no worries about the bank. It (the bank) is doing its utmost to improve its management. We don't believe that the bank will collapse as some media reports have said,"" Mitsuzuka told reporters at his regular news conference.
Nippon Credit's latest ordeal began early Wednesday when traders began to sell its shares on vague talk that NCB would hold an emergency news conference. There was also a vague rumour about a possible merger involving NCB, they said.
The dumping of the bank's shares ignited renewed selling throughout the banking sector. The sharp fall in banking shares has been largely to blame for the tumble in the Tokyo stock market since mid-December.
Nippon Credit shares fell 35 yen (28 cents) to close on Wednesday at an all-time low of 181 yen ($1.47).
In the bond market, NCB's latest debentures are selling at a yield of 4.1 percent, a full 2.5 percentage points above bonds issued by other banks, reflecting the perceived risk in its debts.
Nishikawa said the sell-off was influenced by exaggerated media reports which hyped concerns over the health of Japan's financial system.
""We believe the market condition has deviated greatly from the realities of the bank. We hope market participants will calm down,"" he said.
He also said the bank would be able to post a current profit in 1996/97 even after disposing of problem loans as it had planned -- if Tokyo stock prices remain at their current levels.
Like other banks, NCB relies on its own share holdings to help provide needed cash so as the stock market tumbles, its situation worsens. That has created a vicious circle for the Tokyo stock market.
The bank plans to write off problem loans of 130 billion yen ($1.05 billion) in the current fiscal year ending March 31. As of the end of September, such problem loans totalled 1.39 trillion yen ($11.3 billion).
Some analysts said that it is unclear whether the news conference by NCB and the finance ministry's pledge to support the bank would help regain confidence in Japan's banking sector.
""In the long-term, the banking sector will remain under pressure until Japan completes its 'Big Bang' financial reforms,"" said Katsuhito Sasajima, an analyst at Nikko Research Centre. ($1=123 yen)

787,"The deal with the United States to open Japan's insurance market will create some convulsions in the industry, but analysts said it will help make way for the deregulation of Japan's financial sector.
A final agreement was reached on Sunday, ending a dispute that U.S. President Bill Clinton had called the biggest trade barrier between the two nations.
While it focuses on such esoteric issues as who can sell cancer healthcare policies and whether auto insurance can be purchased through the mail, the issue had become a major political dispute.
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher even got in on the act, calling his Japanese counterpart to apply some last-minute pressure ahead of the Sunday deadline. Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said he was relieved that the whole thing was over.
The United States, in a statement issued by the embassy here, said the measures ""represent fundamental change in the Japanese insurance market, making it more open and competitive.""
Insurance trade groups were less than thrilled, however, saying the agreement ignores the needs of consumers and keeps their firms out of some fast-growing parts of the business.
Under the agreement, Japanese companies will be allowed -- in stages -- to enter the niche ""third sector"" that includes cancer, healthcare and accident coverage. This is the area where foreign firms have gained a foothold.
Foreign firms are expected to benefit from a deregulation of rates in the non-life insurance sector, including fire and auto insurance, to take place by the end of 1998.
Analysts say that even without the U.S. pressure, the changes were coming as part of Hashimoto's drive to revitalise Japan's financial sector.
""It was a matter of when,"" said Kouya Hasegawa, an analyst at Nikko Research Centre.
He said that as with most deregulation, smaller firms will find it tougher to compete in the new world.
""The liberalisation of premiums is a major blow to the non-life insurance industry, particularly medium- to small-sized firms,"" Hasegawa said
Takehito Yamanaka, an analyst at SBC Warburg (Japan) Ltd, agreed: ""It is inevitable that non-life insurers will compete by cutting premiums.""
Medium and small insurers must streamline their network of sales agents to cut costs, he said.
It was not until October that Tokyo removed a ban on mail-order auto insurance under U.S. pressure. Without a network of agents, insurance by mail was seen as an important step for foreign firms.
Income from auto insurance policies account for 40 percent to 50 percent of income at non-life insurance companies, analysts say.
Last month, American Home Assurance Co announced plans for what it says will be Japan's first mail-order car insurance service.
Analysts said the liberalisation of the premiums would eventually result in the disappearance of some financially weak firms and an increase in mergers.
To cope with deregulation, major non-life insurance firm Yasuda Fire &amp; Marine Co Ltd recently announced it would take a majority stake in the Japanese unit of U.S. life insurance giant CIGNA Corp within the next year or two, the first time a Japanese non-life insurer has purchased a life insurance operation.
Under Japan's new Insurance Business Law, which took effect on April 1, non-life and life insurers were allowed to enter each other's business sectors for the first time.
Some in the industry argue that deregulation could create huge problems. They say that higher rates will lead to more uninsured drivers and jeopardise the protection of accident victims.
But no one is predicting that the concerns will stop a deregulation drive across the financial sector that comes to Japan a decade after it hit most industrialised nations.

790,"Investors in Asian countries are turning to Tokyo's property market, formerly notorious for its high prices, says Richard Mandel, managing director of the Japanese unit of U.S. real estate firm Kennedy-Wilson Inc.
Mandel told Reuters in a recent interview that his California-based company could bring foreign investors into Japan's real estate market, currently suffering from a five-year tailspin, and reactivate trade.
This should also help ease one of the Japanese financial industry's biggest headaches -- selling off land collateral to recover something from the huge bad loans run up by Japan's seven failed ""jusen"" mortgage firms, he said.
""We are probably the only foreign company participating in the Japanese real estate market... Many foreign investors from Asia are coming over here, working with us to try to buy Japanese real estate,"" he said.
Asian investors see Tokyo as a powerful world business centre and believe that real estate prices here have come down to attractive levels after plunging 75 percent from the peak reached in the early 1990s, he said.
Japanese property prices went into a tailspin in the early 1990s when the nation's ""bubble economy"" era of soaring stock market and real estate prices came to an end.
Mandel said that while Kennedy-Wilson has not concluded any deals since it started operations in Tokyo in 1995, negotiations are going on with Asian investors, focusing on commercial buildings and apartment buildings in central Tokyo with values of less than 10 billion yen ($89.2 million).
""You can buy prime Japanese real estate much lower than you can buy in Hong Kong and Singapore,"" he said.
Real estate industry sources say big Japanese investors such as life insurers and developers, which were aggressive buyers of land in the bubble era, are finding it hard to allocate new money for land transactions because they carry huge problem assets left from the collapse of the bubble.
Meanwhile, they say banks and construction firms are reluctant to sell their real estate at current prices, and this has greatly decreased market liquidity.
He said Japan should take a look at taxes on capital gains. Japan's real estate market needs many investors from all over the world to become a truly healthy market, but a major drawback is its capital gain tax on land transactions, he said.
The company took part in helping the Resolution Trust Corp in the United States recover debts following the 1980s crisis at ""savings and loan"" mortgage associations, using its auction-marketing system. Mandel believes the system would be useful for selling jusen property.
Mandel will soon leave Japan for New York. Ryosuke Homma, who will take over the Tokyo operation, said making use of the Internet could be a method of soliciting investors.
In July, Japan set up the Housing Loan Administration Corp to recover, over the next 15 years, more than six trillion yen ($53.5 billion) worth of the jusen firms' problem loans in the form of real estate collateral.
Earlier this month, several Japanese ministries set up a joint panel to work out measures to boost liquidity in the property market to facilitate collection of debt through collateralised real estate.
Mandel said real estate sales by the Housing Loan Administration Corp would happen from the start of fiscal 1997, beginning on April 1, ""and this will firmly set market prices"" ($1=112 yen)

795,"Weak Japanese regional banks face a scramble to clean up their bad loan problems before oversight standards are tightened next year, but their room for manoeuvre may be limited by a sagging stock market.
This squeeze on the struggling players in the banking sector could cause more financial collapses and forced liquidations down the road, analysts and banking sources say.
The introduction of formal capital adequacy standards in April next year means banks must deal with non-performing assets or risk being taken to task or closed down by the authorities for failing the new financial health test.
Banking sources and analysts say this is putting pressure on the banks to raise capital in order to bring their ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets to an acceptable balance.
But a weak stock market raises the chances of institutions flunking the capital adequacy test, as it makes it hard for them to raise capital by issuing new shares.
""Smaller banks with a weak capital base must take measures to raise capital before the new system is introduced,"" said Katsuhito Sasajima, a Nikko Research Centre analyst.
One option which has already proved popular with banks is to issue new shares to existing shareholders at a price pitched midway between the market value and face value. But this is getting harder amid the stock market gloom, Sasajima said.
The slide in the stock market is hurting the banks in a number of ways, eroding the paper profits on their share portfolios that they were using to tackle bad loans, as well as narrowing their options for raising fresh capital.
The new adequacy standards, known as the prompt corrective action (PCA) system, are being introduced to bolster confidence in Japan's banking sector by keeping a closer watch on firms' health and preventing problems spinning out of control.
Under the new system, banks are strictly required to set aside loan loss provisions in line with the global accounting standards. To be classed as ""adequately capitalised"", financial institutions operating only in Japan must have an adequacy ratio of four percent or more, while internationally active banks must have a ratio of eight percent.
A bank can be ordered to take action to improve its health, and can be liquidated if its capital adequacy ratio falls below zero percent and inspectors pinpoint inadequacies.
At the moment there are no clear Finance Ministry standards, which has been cited as one factor in the ballooning bad loan problem after the collapse of the 1980s asset bubble.
""The imposition of a strict write-off system (via the PCA)...would force a large number of  smaller, weaker banks to the wall,"" said Yukiko Ohara, an analyst at UBS Securities Ltd, in a recent report.
At the end of last September, problem loans at Japan's deposit-taking financial institutions totalled 29.23 trillion yen ($247 billion), of which 7.3 trillion yen ($61.8 billion) was estimated to be uncovered loan losses, according to Finance Ministry data. But analysts believe the scale is actually much bigger than that.
To boost capital ahead of the new system, about 10 regional banks announced last year that they would issue new shares by the end of March priced halfway between the market and face value. Among them are Hokuetsu Bank Ltd, Hokkoku Bank Ltd, Miyazaki Bank Ltd, Yamagata Bank Ltd and Awa Bank Ltd.
However, analysts say that there are several regional banks with a more urgent need to increase their capital.
Japan's Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported last week that there were 10 regional banks whose capital adequacy ratio was below four percent at the end of March, 1996.
Among them was Hanwa Bank, whose operations -- except for withdrawals -- were suspended by Finance Ministry last November as it was unable to recover bad loans.
Tokyo-based regional bank Tokyo Sowa Bank Ltd has said it had a capital adequacy ratio of 3.8 percent as of March 31, 1996, compared with 4.35 percent a year earlier after going into the red to dispose of a swathe of problem loans, eroding its capital. It disposed of 130 billion yen ($1.10 billion) in problem loans in 1995/96, much more than its competitors and Tokyo Sowa said the problem was now under control.
In order to clear the four percent hurdle by April 1998, the bank will take such steps as procuring subordinated debts and issuing new shares, a bank spokesman said.
Analysts have said that before the PCA system is introduced, the Finance Ministry may have to pull down the shutters at some ailing banks that are unable to break free of bad loans and cannot boost their capital. ($1=118 yen)

796,"Japan's biggest life insurer, Nippon Life Insurance Co, plans to set up a joint venture in the Philippines, becoming the first Japanese company to sell life insurance policies abroad.
A spokesman for Nippon Life said on Monday that it and the Yuchengco group of the Philippines' would sign a contract by the year-end to establish a joint venture by next March.
""Japanese insurers have not gone abroad to sell life insurance policies. We plan to sell policies in the Philippines to people in the medium to high income bracket, and also target Japanese firms that have already entered the country,"" he said.
Nippon Life will own 50 percent of the joint venture, which will be based in Manila. The rest will be owned by two Yuchengco group firms -- 30 percent by Great Pacific Life Assurance Corp and 20 percent by Rizal Commercial Banking Corp.
The size of the capitalisation and the number of staff at the new company have not yet been decided, but Nippon Life is expected to send several executives to the venture, he said.
Nippon Life is also looking to tap lucrative markets elsewhere in Asia as the domestic insurance business approaches saturation point, the spokesman said.
The president of Nippon Life, Josei Itoh, said earlier this year that it wants to help build up the life insurance market in the rest of Asia in collaboration with local firms.
Only an estimated five to 10 percent of people in Southeast Asia have life insurance policies, Itoh said, adding that China's biggest insurer, the People's Insurance Co of China (PICC), could be a candidate for a joint venture.
Nippon Life is a giant in the Japanese insurance business and one of the world's top providers of life cover, with assets of about 39 trillion yen ($348 billion), nearly one-fifth of the value of assets held by Japan's 31 life insurers.
Analysts say the insurance business in emerging Asian countries will grow rapidly in the coming decades. Purchase of life insurance policies is closely tied to an individual's affluence and disposable income, they say.
""While Japan's insurance market is reaching maturity, the prospects for growth are enormous in the rest of Asia as countries there have just begun to build up a pool of their own capital,"" said Nikko Research Centre analyst Kouya Hasegawa.
""Japanese banks and other financial institutions are already targeting Asian markets for future opportunities. Nippon Life took action in the region as the first Japanese life insurer to do so, indicating other big life insurance firms will follow,"" he said. ($1=112 yen)

810,"Shares in perennial bid favourite Zeneca Group Plc spiralled higher once more on Thursday, but analysts said it was on the thinnest of pretexts.
The stock touched a new record of 17.25 pounds during the morning session, with the rise once more triggered by speculation about the intentions of Swiss drugs giant Roche Holding AG. -- hotly tipped by takeover theorists as the only company rich enough to buy Zeneca.
News that Roche had named Franz Humer as chief operating officer combined with talk in the press that Humer is keen to ensure Roche does ""not play second fiddle"" to his old employer Glaxo Wellcome fuelled the latest rise, traders said.
With few people willing to sell Zeneca stock in case they miss out on any takeover, which could be worth $30 billion, the stock is being continually squeezed higher.
Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull (SGST) analyst Peter Laing said Zeneca shares, which have gained 37 percent this year, are now at ""eye-popping"" levels. SGST believes that a hostile bid is implausible at current valuations, and, without this, the stock's current rating is increasingly hard to justify.
""Is it valid for a stock which is only two-thirds a drug stock and the rest agro-chemicals and specialty chemicals to be on the same premium as Pfizer?"" said Laing, who argued that the current gains are a story of ""supply and demand.""
Cash-rich Roche is widely believed to want to make a large acquisition, both to reassert its position as number one in Switzerland and to counteract the shortfall in new drugs coming through the industry's pipeline.
But some analysts and industry executives believe that Zeneca would not necessarily be its chosen target.
One industry source said he believed Roche would be much more interested in the U.S. company Schering-Plough Corp, which had a similar market capitalization to Zeneca. He said Roche had eyed Schering Plough on a number of occasions.
Schering-Plough would offer Roche a much stronger footing in the key U.S. market than Zeneca, and it would plug gaps in Roche's existing infrastrucure, offering the Swiss group badly-needed muscle in the non-hospital and U.S. over-the-counter sectors.
However, analysts said Zeneca had a more attractive pipeline of new drugs than Schering-Plough. And as the world's second-biggest cancer drug company after Bristol Myers Squibb Co it would also boost Roche in a key therapeutic area.
""I am quite sure that at the right price several companies would like to acquire Zeneca,"" said Panmure Gordon analyst Robin Gilbert, adding that good quality medium-to-large businesses like Zeneca and Schering-Plough are few and far between.
But Gilbert said Zeneca, which is ""firing on all cylinders"" since its split from chemicals group ICI Plc in 1993, is determined to remain independent.
""They believe they have a future as an independent company, and obviously they don't agree with the size philosphy of people like Glaxo Wellcome,"" Gilbert said.

813,"Milumil babymilk powder, used by around 25,000 mothers in Britain and Ireland, was withdrawn from from stores and clinics on Friday after a scare over Salmonella poisoning.
Milupa, part of the Dutch specialist food producer Nutricia NV, said it was withdrawing its Milumil milk powder in Britain because of an unconfirmed link with 12 cases of a rare form of the Salmonella bug.
The company later followed suit in Ireland after consultations with the Irish government, despite saying that no incidents had been reported there.
The company was forced to launch a damage limitation exercise after it was contacted by Britain's Department of Health on Thursday afternoon.
Government scientists had identified 12 cases of Salmonella anatum infection, leading to gastro-enteritis, in children under 12 months old which followed consumption of the French-made milk, sold as ""Milumil for Hungrier Bottle Fed Babies.""
The Health Department said that only two of the children involved were admitted to hospital and all had since recovered. However it told parents and other carers to stop using the product immediately and ordered the withdrawal of all stocks.
""There is no direct, incontrovertible proof that (the cause) is Milumil. It is a statistical association but we have to take every precaution,"" a company spokeswoman told Reuters.
Shares in Nutricia were suspended for around an hour in Amsterdam after falling sharply. However they later recovered much of their losses, closing down 9.70 guilders at 267, above a low of 260.50 guilders.
Milupa said it would hold a thorough investigation at the French plant where the milk was made, and added that production of the product had been suspended.
Sales of Milumil milk powder total between six and seven million pounds a year, and the product has a market share of around five percent. Another Milumil product, Milumil Ready to Feed, is not affected.
Dutch-based Nutricia, which also owns the Cow &amp; Gate brand, is no stranger to controversy.
In June 1993, it withdrew all of its powdered baby food products in the United States because of possible Salmonella contamination.
And 140 million guilders were wiped off the value of the company in November of the same year after it recalled batches of its Olvarit baby food when excessive levels of disinfectant were found in some samples.

828,"New evidence about British Biotech Plc's anti-cancer treatment Marimastat next week will provide important clues about its potential as a blockbuster product, analysts said on Friday.
British Biotech is using a meeting of the European Society of Medical Oncologists (ESMO) in Vienna to make five presentations, including Marimastat's effects in ovarian, colo-rectal, pancreatic and gastric cancer. It will issue a general update on Monday morning.
The Oxford-based group has become the bellwether for the increasingly crowded biotech field in the U.K, with sentiment towards Marimastat having a disproportionate impact on the sector.
Millions of pounds of investors' money has been placed on the bet that Marimastat will turn out to be Europe's first big-selling biotech product, with forecasts for annual sales ranging from a few hundred million dollars to up to $4 billion.
Monday's data comes from patients who continued to use the drug beyond the period necessary for completion of Phase II clinical trials. The company said this meant there would be a further six months of extra information.
Yamaichi International analyst Erling Refsum said he hoped to see the first hard evidence that patients were living longer as a result of taking Marimastat. Refsum said the surrogate marker data provided so far ""is like the indicator board at the train station rather than the train actually coming.""
In a note on the trials Lehman Brothers analyst Ian Smith, who will attend the ESCO meeting, said it might be possible to glean indications of the effect of Marimastat on patient survival in ovarian and pancreatic cancer.
There will also be interest in Marimastat's impact on gastric cancer, where little information has so far been available. And analysts are keen to see how serious the side effects caused by the drug are. The main problem reported so far is joint pain.
Yamaichi's Refsum said the results are ""not definitive as to whether it works or not, but it is another indication as to whether it will sell or won't sell, and that is the bottom line."" Lehman's Smith added that the results ""won't prove Marimastat's efficacy but will raise the probabilities.""
British Biotech will announce late-stage data on another key product, pancreatitis drug Lexipafant, on November 27.
Smith said that favourable news on both drugs could lift the group's share price to 300 pence by the end of the month from 230 at Friday's close. But Refsum is more sceptical about the potential impact of Marimastat and said 150 pence is ""reasonable value"" for the shares.
A British Biotech spokeswoman said Phase III Marimastat trials are likely to take two years to complete, meaning that the first results would not be available until 1998 at the earliest. But she said British Biotech would probably make academic presentations at conferences like ESMO from time to time to keep the market up to date.
Late stage trials on pancreatic cancer started in June, and trials in small-cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, gastric cancer and a form of brain cancer are being set up, she added.

830,"British Petroleum Co Plc (BP) extolled the virtues of ""self help"" on Tuesday as it reported its best-ever third quarter earnings despite pressure on profit margins in some key businesses.
Third-quarter net earnings jumped by 22 percent to 650 million pounds ($1.07 billion), towards the top end of forecasts, while in the first nine months of the year they were up 28 percent to a record 1.93 billion pounds.
BP said strong oil prices, which have recently been at their highest levels since the 1991 Gulf War at around $22 a barrel, boosted earnings by between $400 million-$500 million in the third quarter.
But it added that the gains were more than offset by weaker profit margins in refining, marketing and chemicals, which accounted for about 27 percent of group net earnings.
Group chief executive John Browne said BP was enjoying the benefits of a raft of cost-cutting and efficiency drives, which were adding $150 million to profit every quarter.
""What we see here has not come about as a result of high oil prices, it has come about as a result of self help,"" he said.
The market took the results calmly, with BP shares adding two pence to close at 640.5 pence after touching a high of 647p. However, trading in BP shares on the options market was active.
""People are still speculating on a fairly sharp rise in BP shares,"" one options specialist said.
""In a sense BP have spoilt us,"" said Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull analyst Irene Himona.
""We've got used to them coming out with a good set of numbers at the top of the range, and unfortunately with (rival) Shell it is the other way around.""
BP's results contrasted with disappointment last week at third-quarter figures from rival Royal Dutch/Shell Group, where profits fell on the back of low refining margins and a weak chemicals market.
BP also emphasised the relative stability in its earnings, partly as a result of the vigorous cost-cutting at its exploration and production activities.
""They are very much on the ball and very focused. They have achieved a lot of efficiency improvements and delivered a lot of savings,"" said Himona.
BP was upbeat about near term propsects, with oil demand expected to remain strong into 1997. But it said its long-term view that the oil price would settle back into a range of $16 to $18 a barrel had not changed. ""The question is how we get from here to there,"" said Browne.
Morgan Stanley analyst Chris Buckley said the oil price was always the greatest uncertainty, but added that lower prices tended to mean margins could improve in downstream activities like chemicals and refining.

In an interview with Reuters at this week's British International Motor Show in Birmingham, Daewoo UK Ltd managing director Tong Won Rhie said: ""We are now reviewing the performance over the past two years, and the UK strategy has proved a good model.""
He said adapting the policy of cutting out car dealerships by selling directly to customers, which has rapidly carved Daewoo a significant slice of Britain's highly competitive car market, ""is a big possibility.""
Daewoo already operates in 12 European countries and is preparing to launch its models, which are revamped versions of old General Motors Corp cars, in five more.
In its first nine months of operation in Britain last year Daewoo sold more than 13,000 cars. And by October 8 this year Rhie said it had already sold another 18,500 units.
""Our target when we launched was one percent market share in three years. We have already reached that,"" Rhie said.
Daewoo, which likes to advertise itself as breaking the mould of car supply in Britain, launched itself through cleverly targeted publicity, including surveys of customer likes and dislikes.
Rhie summed up customers' pet hates as ""too much hassle"" from salesmen and poor aftercare once the sale was complete.
""It is like a wedding, with the customer as the bride. Before, they say I love you, darling,' and all that, but after the marriage they forget,"" Rhie said.
Daewoo was the first company to offer three years' free servicing on all models and packed its cars with extras including airbags and mobile phones.
It has also led a revolution in all-inclusive pricing, a trend followed this week by GM unit Vauxhall Motors and by Porsche AG with its new Boxster sports car.
But Rhie said its U.K. strategy was not applicable to all markets, particularly those where the relationship between car producers and dealers is even more entrenched than in Britain.
""The UK market is more sophisticated than many other countries. The level of (consumer) awareness is higher.""
Daewoo has encountered severe criticism from rivals, some of whom are alarmed at the speed with which it has penetrated the British market, where it has overtaken longer-established names like Saab, Mitsubishi and Hyundai.
Some question whether its pioneering servicing agreement with the Halfords superstore chain can provide the level of support for customers that it claims.
Daewoo's response to criticism that its current range of models is outmoded will be to launch three entirely new cars at the end of 1997. Rhie said one of these, known as the J Car, had been developed largely by its U.K. R&amp;D operation in the southern town of Worthing, which employs nearly 1,000 people.
Rhie declined to state Daewoo's next target for U.K. market share. ""Quantity is very important but that is not the final goal,"" he said. ""Our aim is a customer focus and how to continuously follow up customers' requirements.""

Analysts are forecasting a leap in pre-tax profit for the year to around 1.0 billion pounds ($1.62 billion) from 619 million pounds in 1995 when Zeneca unveils results on March 11.
With a strong set of results already factored into the share price, Zeneca stock settled back four pence to 1689-1/2 pence in early trading.
Bumper pharmaceutical sales will help to drive profits forward, with 1996 sales volumes likely to be ahead by around 14 percent year-on-year.
Sales of the group's biggest-selling product, cardiovascular drug Zestril, are tipped to rise at a similar rate to 1995's 12 percent growth, despite increased competition from rival Merck &amp; Co MRK.L 's Prinivil and Cozaar.
Established prostate cancer treatment Zoladex also ""continued to grow strongly,"" Zeneca said, while a decline in sales of its ageing breast cancer product Nolvadex slowed.
In a quarterly trading statement, Zeneca highlighted the performance of new drugs, with sales of prostate treatment Casodex and Nolvadex back-up Arimidex beating expectations. The recent launch of a novel tablet asthma drug Accolate in the U.S. has ""gone well,"" the group said.
Sales of agro-chemicals last year ""were close"" to the 14 percent rise reported at the nine-month stage, with record sales of herbicides and of the insecticide Karate.
Operating profits at the slimmed-down specialities business were likely to be above 1995 levels after ""a particularly strong second-half performance,"" Zeneca said.

Finance director James Noble told Reuters the company had been deliberately cautious about its statement on Monday, because it was ""extremely concerned not to raise patients' hopes of the drug.""
But he said there was ""significant"" evidence that Marimastat increased the chances of survival in cancer patients and added ""in many ways I think it is the most impressive data since the company was founded.""
The studies, based on 381 cancer patients who continued taking the drug after the 28-day period required for Phase II trials, confirmed Marimastat's ability to reduce the rate of rise of cancer antigens, one measure of how much cancer is present in the body.
""Those patients who continued to take it for more than 28 days lived ... significantly longer"" than those who stopped taking it, Noble said.
One of the supporters of the drug, Greig Middleton analyst John Savin, agreed, saying that ""on this information today we can say that ... 37 percent (of patients) had a real overall response which improved their survival chance significantly.""
However, others expressed disappointment that British Biotech failed to provide more detailed analysis of side-effects caused by Marimastat. The Oxford-based group confirmed that it caused joint pain, mainly in the arm and shoulder, with around 30 percent of patients affected after three to five months.
Yamaichi International analyst Erling Refsum said the side effect profile would be crucial to Marimastat's potential.
""Drugs become top sellers because of their side effect profile rather than because of their efficacy profile,"" he said.
Noble played down concerns about side effects, saying ""they are not a serious problem. They are reversible.""
Patients who suffered badly could interrupt their treatment from time to time without adverse impact.
Analysts said credible estimates of exactly how big Marimastat will turn out to be would be impossible until final, Phase III trials were completed.
This means investors will have to wait until 1998 at the earliest for hard evidence about whether their optimism about Marimastat and British Biotech is well founded.

835,"British building materials group Blue Circle Industries Plc produced the first tentative signs of a turnaround at its troubled European heating operations on Tuesday and set out ambitious plans for a ten-fold increase in operating profits at the division over the next three years.
The recovery in the heating sector, together with continued strong performance in the highly profitable Chile and Malaysia markets and the USA, helped lift Blue Circle's interim pretax profit by 11.7 percent to 116.3 million pounds ($181.5 million), at the top end of analysts' forecasts, with the interim dividend rising by 6 percent to 4.25 pence.
The heating operations, which are undergoing a major restructuring focused on France, Germany and the Britain, posted operating profits of nine million pounds in the six months to June, up from just 100,000 pounds a year before.
However, Britain's biggest cement producer also warned that it sees ""no significant signs of recovery"" in the key British cement market, and against a backdrop of a weak stock market Blue Circle shares slipped 5.5 pence to 373.5 pence by 1105 GMT.
Blue Circle chief executive Keith Orrell-Jones told Reuters the group's aim of achieving annual cost savings of 25 million pounds from restructuring heating is ""well up to programme,"" with nine million pounds coming through this year and the full benefit seen in 1997.
Orrell-Jones said he is confident the group can achieve a 15 percent return on its 600 million pound investment in the struggling division, or some 90 million pound, within three years, despite sluggish economic performance in Germany and France.
""We are disappointed with the performance of the economies of both those countries, and we think it is not likely to ease very rapidly,"" said Orrell-Jones, adding ""that is why we set a three-year time horizon"" for recovery.
Blue Circle blamed a 24 percent drop in operating profit at the British cement operations on low infrastructure investment and ""weak new housing starts."" Orrell-Jones said the full-year outcome will be better than the first half, but he does not expect any real upturn until next spring.
With gearing a miniscule 1.5 percent at the end of June, Orrell-Jones confirmed Blue Circle is actively looking for opportunities to expand.
""We'd like to grow our cement business: it depends on where the opportunities crop up. In the U.S. it's a question of waiting for the right opportunity and the right time in the cycle,"" he said.
Blue Circle is ""actively looking in South-East Asia, and we are taking a very careful look at India,"" he said, adding that it is also interested in expanding its south American operations beyond the fast-growing Chile market.

836,"Biotechnology company Celltech Group Plc said late on Tuesday that it expected to post a pre-tax loss of around 10 million stg in the year to September 1997 before moving firmly into profit.
Finance director Peter Allen said in an interview with Reuters that a further 10 million stg receipt next December from the 1996 sale of the Biologics business to Alusuisse-Lonza Holding AG would push the group back into the black the following year. Analysts said around half of the payment would go to Celltech's bottom line.
And a successful launch of Celltech's septic shock treatment, being developed with Germany's Bayer AG, and leukaemia drug, with American Home Products Corp should see the Slough-based group post an operating profit in 1999.
""I think that 1997/1998 will be a better year. Providing both products launch when we expect them to launch we will start to get some contribution from the septic shock product in 1998,"" he said.
With the Biologics sale swelling cash in the bank to more than 46 million stg at the end of last September, Allen said Celltech would have no need to seek fresh funding for its day-to-day operations. A cash-call would only have to be made if there were problems with the two lead drugs or Celltech decided to make an acquisition.
Cash burn for the current year would be just under 10 million stg, Allen said, with spending on research and development rising by around a fifth to 21 million stg. He predicted that milestone payments would be at similar levels to last year, totalling 5.5 to 6.0 million stg.
Allen added that analysts' forecasts of 3.5 million stg of royalties from the Centocor/Eli Lilly product ReoPro were ""fairly conservative.""
Chief executive Peter Fellner told Reuters that Celltech remained committed to its strategy of collaborating with major drug companies, but was considering taking more products through to later stages of development itself. He said the group's psoriasis drug, currently in Phase II trials, would be a prime candidate for such a move.
""We can see that by doing it ourselves, at least in Europe, we can control the timetable better ... and probably get a larger slice of the cake,"" he said.
The chief executive also told Reuters that Celltech could be interested in making an acquisition in the right circumstances. He praised rival Chiroscience Group Plc's $120 million acquisition of U.S. gene technology company Darwin last November as ""very creative.""
""I think if we could identify a particular set or sets of technology, or alternatively one or two pipeline products, then potentially we would have an interest..but we wouldn't simply go and buy something with a view to making ourselves that bit bigger.""

British Biotech's shares ended the day 19 pence lower at 210 after its keenly-awaited announcement appeared to provide comfort for both bulls and bears.

844,"Drug group Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc said on Wednesday it was still keen to forge a cancer drug partnership in the U.S. as part of its goal of becoming a major oncology player over the next five years.
Setting out the U.S.-based group's growth strategy, RPR President Tim Rothwell said the company ""aims to be in the top five, and ideally the top three"" in cancer sales.
RPR ranked 15th in oncology sales in 1995. Rothwell said the improvement would be driven by breast and lung cancer drug Taxotere, which he predicted would achieve peak sales of at least $500 million over the next five years.
Sales this year are forecast to double in 1997 from around $90 million last year. Brain cancer treatment Gliadel, which Rothwell said should be approved in the U.S. in 1998, will also fuel the improvement.
""We continue to be interested in a partnership or alliance in the U.S. Others have two or three cancer products in a market dominated by Bristol-Myers Squibb, so it would make sense to ally ourselves,"" he said.
Rothwell cited RPR's link with Novo Nordisk on hormone replacement therapy as a model for other therapeutic alliances.
He again brushed aside recent speculation that RPR, which is 68 percent-owned by France's Rhone-Poulenc SA, could be a suitor for Sanofi, saying that the French company would not help achieve his aim of building up RPR's strength in the U.S. and Japan.
""The U.S. is still the largest and most profitable market in the world,"" Rothwell said, noting that only 24 percent of RPR's sales are in the United States compared to more than 40 percent for many of its rivals.
He said he wanted to raise U.S. sales to around 35 percent of the group's total, adding: ""That will only come about through internal growth and perhaps from opportunistic product deals."" In Japan RPR's strategy would be to continue with alliances and to build on the ""eight or nine products in Phase II and Phase III trials.""
""If the right kind of acquisition came along we would consider it, but the very good Japanese companies are the ones that can't be bought,"" he added.
In addition to cancer, RPR's growth strategy will centre on enhancing its position in key therapeutic areas, including thrombosis, asthma/allergy and anti-infectives.
It will also seek to swap non-core products with other companies and build up its base of early-stage products through links with universities and biotech companies.
In thrombosis, where RPR is number three in the world, the company expects sales of its best-selling drug Lovenox to double by the end of the century to more than $800 million.
In asthma and allergy, where RPR's position was enhanced by the acquisition of Britain's Fisons FISN.L, Rothwell said RPR was likely to remain in fourth place in five years' time, but predicted it would have overtaken Germany's Boehringer and would be challenging Sweden's Astra for third place.
Rothwell also hopes RPR will move up from 15th to be in the top five for anti-infective sales by the year 2005. He said new oral antibiotic Zagam and ""other compounds under consideration"" should boost its standing.
RPR is currently the 11th largest drug company in the world in terms of total sales. On Monday the company announced a 25 percent jump in 1996 net profits to $428.7 million.

847,"Chemicals group Courtaulds Plc is targeting sales growth of at least 10 percent a year up to the end of the century at its key coatings business as it reaps the fruits of a major modernisation drive and Far Eastern expansion.
Speaking to journalists at a recent presentation, Courtaulds European Coatings finance director Bob Wheeler said the group's multi-million pound restructuring of its European and U.S coating operations launched in 1994 was starting to pay off.
""The profits coming through now are...partly because of our Far East expansion, but also because of the restructuring programmes we have got in place in Europe and the U.S,"" he said.
Courtaulds will have spent around 75 million pounds ($125 million) on reorganising and updating its European manufacturing base -- centred in Britain, France, Germany, Sweden and Spain -- by the end of 1998.
Wheeler said a similar amount was being spent in the United States.
The coatings and sealants division supplies specialist paint and protective products to the marine and aerospace sectors as well as powder coatings for a wide range of products including cars, buildings and washing machines.
In the six months through September 30, sales at the division rose 4.6 percent to 501 million pounds. This represented around 47 percent of the group's total.
But Wheeler said the group had much greater ambitions.
""I think we would be disappointed if we weren't growing the business by 10 percent per annum through organic growth ... up to the end of the century,"" Wheeler said.
He said the division was also benefiting from Courtauld's decision in the early 1990s to get out of low margin businesses such as general industrial coatings and household paints and to exploit its long-standing presence in fast-growing Asia.
Courtaulds has built on its presence in Hong Kong, where it has been represented since the 1950s, to the point where it is involved in every major market in the region.
Asian growth was a major factor behind the rise in the division's first-half sales.
Courtauld's Coatings had chosen its marine and yacht coatings site at Felling in northeast England as one of six prototype factories for improvements in quality, productivity and safety which it planned to roll out across the division's 70-plus sites around the world, Wheeler said.
Using U.S. chemicals giant EI Du Pont de Nemours as its benchmark for safety standards and Nippon Paint for best practise in working methods, Courtaulds said it had already transformed the operation at Felling.
Wheeler said investment at the site, which is expected to total around 10 million pounds, had resulted in output doubling to 400 litres of paint per man hour in just two years, while wastage had more than halved.
Last month the site won an award sponsored by corporate advisers KPMG for most improved British factory in competition with more than 200 other British plants.
Wheeler said the transformation of the site, which Courtaulds had operated for more than 100 years, ""was about people, training and the equipment we use."" He said Felling was now ""a genuinely world class site.""

850,"Major airlines operating cargo flights to Europe are to raise their ex-Hong Kong cargo rates by HK80 cents per kg from November 4 to try and offset increased jet fuel prices, airline officials told Reuters.
Stanley Hui, the chief operating officer of the territory's all-cargo airline, AHK Air Hong Kong Ltd, said an emergency meeting of airlines was held in Hong Kong this morning to discuss a fuel surcharge.
Among the airlines represented were Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd, Lufthansa Cargo, Air France, Martinair and Cargolux, he said.
However British Airways World Plc -- a major carrier from Hong Kong to London was not represented, industry sources said.
""Fuel costs have escalated to such a level that it is only right and fair that the shippers share some of the cost because the impact on the airlines has been very obvious,"" Hui said.
Other carriers operating trans-Pacific routes for instance are also expected to follow suit with a similar increase, Hui added.  
Philippe Bour, regional cargo manager for Air France in Hong Kong said his airline will apply the increase from November 4 along with Lufthansa Cargo. Cargolux, Air Hong Kong and other carriers would follow a few days later, he added.
""It is a world-wide problem. Fuel prices in France rose 51 per cent from June to October, in Asia they have risen 33 per cent this year and something has to be done. We hope this will help us,"" Bour said.
Another cargo manager said, ""It is not a case of running out of patience but of running out of money.""
Japan Airlines Co Limited yesterday reported a 60.7 percent slump in profits in the six months to September due to higher fuel costs and the yen's retreat against the dollar.
JAL said fuel costs had risen by US$128 million compared with a year ago.
Other major Asian cargo airlines in the region say they are watching the situation closely.
Ming Fai Lai, cargo manager for China Airlines in Hong Kong, said it is waiting before deciding to follow suit but said an 80 cents rise would only have a limited benefit.
""If all European carriers unanimously raise their rates then we will follow but it is not clear if they will all adopt the same policy. 80 cents may help a little bit but for the future I don't think it will help that much,"" said Lai. --Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax +44 171 542 5017

""We quite successfully expanded our cargo business by bringing in quite a substantial proportion of freighter capacity from outside the airline and I don't see why that should not continue. It's true Hong Kong is a particularly good market for freight and I am sure the air cargo industry will continue in the future,"" Ayling told reporters in Hong Kong. He is visiting the territory as part of a tour of key BA destinations with the theme 'Taking British Airways into the new millennium.' promoting how he will be ""reinventing"" the airline
""We have had a firm policy for the past ten years not to buy freighters and I see no reason to change that. I think if you asked KLM and Lufthansa, they would prefer to be in my position. I think we will continue to operate freighters but only on a wet lease basis not involving any capital expenditure,"" he added.
BA says it currently offers a three times weekly service between London Gatwick and Hong Kong using a Boeing 747-200 freighter wet leased from Atlas Air Inc. It also has 14 Boeing 747-400 passenger flights a week to London offering belly cargo capacity.

DHL celebrates its tenth anniversary of China operations next month ""far ahead of our competitors and with 30 per cent market share"", Tseng told Reuters in his Hong Kong office near Kai Tak airport.
Tseng said China may win 10 per cent of all DHL sales within Asia by the year 2000. DHL expects to expand its Chinese network to 26 by the end of this year and 40 within the next three years from the current 19. The new offices, to include Harbin, Pudong and Kunming, are in 50-50 joint ventures witrh Chinese partners, DHL said.
DHL's China venture began in 1986 when it set up a joint venture with China's largest forwarding company Sinotrans. DHL says it received another boost three years ago when it became the first joint venture to offer express links between domestic Chinese companies.
""Choosing the right partner was vital as is demonstrating a long term committment to China. We have demonstrated that,"" Tseng said.
Like all fast freight companies trying to do business in China, Tseng says the lack of infrastructure is a handicap but DHL is leading the way by expanding its network.
""The distribution network and lack of freight links has been identified as the key problem. But service quality and flexibility is particularly important in China,"" he added.
The 20 year veteran with DHL said that unlike rivals such as Federal Express, it enjoys a competitive advantage in China by not having its own fleet of aircraft running in competition with Chinese airlines. Tseng says he wants to strengthen the company's ""very good"" existing relationships with third party local airlines such as China Northern and China Eastern.
Tseng also said the average express shipment is getting heavier and pointed to the marketing success of DHL's Jumbo Box as offering a simple one price product which customers find easy to understand.

The division of Virgin Atlantic Airways says China gave permission for the short cut after recent negotiations with the British government which also benefits British Airways Plc.
Virgin's pilots are due to begin the new northerly route via Beijing and then over Russia and Germany on October 27. The southerly track currently used is over Thailand, Bangladesh, Tashkent and Turkey.

879,"An American airline has successfully completed a proving flight over Russian air space which the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said is an important milestone in the introduction of the Future Air Navigation System (FANS) on trans-Pacific routes.
The United Airlines Boeing 747-400 flight from Chicago to Tokyo's Narita airport on November 15 is expected to be followed by more pioneering trials over the next three weeks by Singapore Airlines, Japan Airlines and Cathay Pacific Airways Limited, said David Behrens, international programme officer of the FAA.
FANS, or Communication Navigation Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM), is the next generation air traffic management system which uses satellite navigation for the more efficient use of air space.
""Aircraft which are FANS equipped will have the competitive edge with reduced costs all round. The technology will mean more direct routes, less fuel burned, more cargo carried, reduced air traffic controls costs, reduced errors and ground delays -- there is no turning back"", David Behrens told this week's Asian Air Cargo Summit.
The U.S. was working towards a new bilateral agreement with Russia to develop air traffic control infrastructure in the Far East to open up air space to airlines flying between Asia and American cities such as New York, Chicago and Detroit.
""There have been a lot of problems in getting demonstration flights approved by the Russian authorities. The use of English which is the international language of the skies is still a major problem. This is another milestone in the development of FANS and the most successful proving flight to date although it is still early days,"" Behrens said.
Speaking after the conference Behrens said further advances are hoped for at the Informal Pacific Air Traffic Control Co-ordination Group meeting in Tokyo on January 20.
Airlines which have already invested in FANS cockpit technology are waiting on the go ahead for a new ""fast track"" routing across the central Pacific Ocean cutting up to an hour off journey times between Hong Kong or Taipei to San Francisco or Los Angeles. China Airlines, United Airlines and Cathay Pacific which is awaiting Hong Kong government approval to use FANS cockpit technology, could be the first airlines to benefit, Behrens said.
Korean Airlines, which has to make a big U-turn to avoid military training areas near North Korea air space, is also expected to make ""huge savings"" from FANS technology with a 40 minute saving on U.S. bound flights from Seoul when a new agreement with the North is signed, the FAA estimate.
Only about 70 Boeing 747-400 aircraft, the inter-continental workhorse of many airlines, are currently equipped with FANS avionics but that total is about to mushroom and all airliners will be FANS equipped by the year 2002, Behrens predicted. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017

Since Monday the 300 index has fallen 106 points or more than 1.7 percent.
""The market is a little shaky right now, and I imagine there's some people taking profits,"" said MMS International analyst Katherine Beattie. Market players sold stocks to reap profits after big gains earlier this year.
Trading was brisk with 111.3 million shares changing hands worth C$1.8 billion.
""Another one of those middle-cycle corrections,"" said ScotiaMcLeod senior vice-president Fred Ketchen. ""I expect this to be short-lived.""
Ketchen said he expected Toronto to continue to rise since investors have nowhere to turn. Fixed income markets generally provide lower returns than equities, especially since Canadian interest rates have fallen dramatically this year.
The important gold sector rose nearly three percent today, which prevented a further decline in the index. The other 13 sub-indices were led lower by conglomerates, media, transports and banks.
Declining issues beat out advancing ones 581 to 428 while 272 were left unchanged.
Among the active stocks were Bre-X Minerals Ltd. and Barrick Gold Corp. Bre-X jumped C$1.30 to C$20.20 on more than five million shares.
Bre-X said today that it and Barrick have made some progress on an ownership deal over Bre-X's huge Busang gold discovery in Indonesia. The Indonesian government, which advised a joint venture between the two, has not yet extended today's deadline.

Heavily-weighted gold stocks began the day stronger, but turned softer amid volatile bullion prices.
""We had a negative reversal in gold,"" said MMS International analyst Katherine Beattie.
Midland Walwyn analyst Dunnery Best said investors reaped the benefits of Toronto's recent rally by selling some holdings.
""Little bit of profit-taking here and there,"" Best said, adding ""it's been a heck of a run.""
Toronto posted four record closing highs during a seven-day winning streak which was broken by Monday's decline.
Beattie said short-term losses could be expected after a gain of about 215 points. ""A one-to-three day pull-back is not surprising,"" she said.
Traders began the day nervously awaiting comments by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on the U.S. economy, but his generally upbeat assessment was a boost for Wall Street equities.
In Toronto, all 14 sub-indices slipped except transportation, pipelines and real estate. Falling sectors included consumer products, conglomerates, oils and media.
Declining stocks outnumbered advances 559 to 454 with 274 issues unchanged.

907,"- The chief financial officer of debt-ridden Rogers Communications Inc., resigned suddenly Monday.
Graham Savage, well-respected by analysts and considered a restraining force on flamboyant president Ted Rogers, had been with the firm for 21 years. He resigned to ""pursue other interests,"" the company said.
""Of all the senior individuals who have left Rogers in recent times, the departure of Savage is the most detrimental to the company, given Savage is the man who has held it all together for the past few years,"" said Lawrence and Co. analyst Andrew McCreath.
Analyst John Drolet at Toronto's Yorkton Securities said, ""This is not good for Rogers at all. I wouldn't be surprised if other people left.""
Rogers, which also owns Rogers Cantel, a wireless communications firm, has shed U.S. and Canadian assets in the past year in an attempt to cut its debts. Rogers piled up most of its debt load when it acquired Maclean Hunter Ltd., along with the Toronto Sun group, for C$3.1 billion ($2.26 billion).
Total long-term debt grew to C$4.88 billion ($3.56 billion) as of June 30 from a year-earlier C$4.07 billion ($2.97 billion).
In 1995, Rogers had revenue of C$2.69 billion ($1.96 billion).
""Graham Savage was a pretty good guy. He was able to keep the wolves away as ... Ted Rogers kept adding on assets. But I guess he finally realized that there's an end to the line,"" Drolet said.
Alan Horn, vice-president of administration, will serve as acting chief financial officer until another is found, the company said.
In a statement, Ted Rogers said: ""We remain committed to the near-term financial priorities of improving our balance sheet and increasing revenues as we invest in new businesses.""
Rogers' stock, after being halted earlier in the day on the Toronto Stock Exchange, fell 80 cents to close at C$9.25.
In New York, Rogers fell 50 cents to $6.875 on the New York Stock Exchange.

The Toronto Stock Exchange key 300 Composite Index lost 43.9 points to end at 5922.2 points, after nearly touching the 6000-point level yesterday.
Ron Meisels, president of P &amp; C Holdings Ltd, said some profit-taking was justified after the 300 Index's bold move upward this month.
Investors sold off some holdings to reap profits since the closely-watched 300 Index gained more than five percent since the beginning of November, Meisels said.
Trading was heavy, with 124 million shares turned over worth C$1.85 billion (US$1.38 billion).
An equities trader agreed. ""We could be in for a corrective phase here.""
Other analysts have said a pull-back was possible.
Weak gold bullion prices exacerbated the situation, dragging Toronto's gold stocks down. London gold prices dropped to their lowest level in nearly two years after heavy selling forced it through a technical support level of US$377 an ounce to as low as C$375.70.
Banks stocks, which also enjoyed recent gains, suffered from profit-taking, the trader said.
Only three of Toronto's 14 sub-indices rose: conglomerates, oils and pipelines.
The gold sector lost nearly 2.9 percent today, followed lower by banks, transports and consumer products.
Declining stocks raced ahead of declining ones 593 to 395. Another 272 traded flat.

Toronto was also dragged down by its heavily weighted gold index, which fell 2.7 percent in the second day of a retreat.

The market opened stronger, turned mixed at midday but surged again after Barrick and Bre-X announced their negotiations. The Indonesian government had asked Bre-X to form a joint venture with Barrick.
""That pulled the gold and precious metals sub-sector higher,"" said MMS International analyst Katherine Beattie.
Barrick, the world's third largest gold producer, has a relative weighting of 3.28 percent on the TSE's list of its top 300 stocks. Relative weighting describes the impact a particular share issue has on the 300 list.
Bre-X, which saw its shares tumble, is not included in the TSE 300 index.

930,"Several large-capitalization Canadian stocks could benefit, while others may be hurt when the Toronto Stock Exchange changes rules governing control blocks in its key 300 Composite Index on Friday.
Stocks such as Barrick Gold Corp, funeral home operator Loewen Group Inc and energy firm Petro-Canada should get snapped up by fund managers when the rules change, analysts said.
""Index funds, which try to match the weighting of the index, are going to have to scramble to buy X percent more Barrick shares...by Friday,"" said an analyst who declined to be identified.
The Toronto Stock Exchange, which handles more than 80 percent of Canada's equity trading, will increase the relative weighting of 30 stocks on Friday by raising the level of control blocks to 20 percent from 15 percent.
The change will take effect at the start of trading on Friday.
Relative weighting describes the impact a stock or sub-group has on the overall TSE 300 Composite Index.
A control block is a group of shares owned by a single entity. Control blocks are not considered part of a stock's weighting because these shares cannot freely trade in the market.
Under the new rules, the federal government's 18.26 percent holding in Petro-Canada Inc will be included in the company's overall float. Petro-Canada's will therefore see its weighting rise to 1.22 percent from about 1.03 percent.
The TSE is changing the definition of a control block to comply with Ontario Securities Commission reporting rules, said Tara O'Donnell, director of derivative markets management.
The Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board, one of Canada's biggest pension fund managers, will need to make some changes, said Zev Frishman, manager of quantitative products.
Teachers' has almost C$45 billion in assets with a third of its money in Canadian equities.
""I cannot go into specific numbers or anything like that, but in essence we will have to, to some extent, adjust positions,"" Frishman said.
Barrick will likely be one of the stocks snapped up, analysts said.
Barrick, which is 15.7 percent owned by Trizec Hahn Corp, will now be weighted based on 100 percent of its shares from 84.3 percent. As a result, the world's third largest gold producer will see its relative weighting in the TSE 300 increase to 3.28 percent from 2.84 percent.
Loewen's weighting will jump to about 1.74 percent from about 0.64 percent, after a control block held by chief executive Raymond Loewen and his wife is included.
Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement Services (OMERS) said it expected the control block changes to have little impact on its funds.
""You have to remember that the actual changes relative to the market overall are quite small,"" said Tom Gunn, senior vice-president of OMERS' investment division.
The list of 30 affected stocks also includes gold producer Franco-Nevada Mining Corp Ltd, Quebecor Printing Inc, publisher Hollinger Inc, energy firm Gulf Canada Resources Ltd and Shaw Industries Ltd.
Others are Astral Communications Inc, BC Sugar Refinery Ltd, CCL Industries Inc and Co-Steel Inc, Corel Corp, Cognos Inc, Cinram Ltd., Edper Group Ltd and First Marathon Inc and Tee-Comm Electronics Inc.

956,"The federal government's bid to pry open the phone business has hit a snag that could postpone the onset of full-blown competition in the local and long-distance markets and delay cheaper phone service.
The snag came when a federal appeals court Tuesday suspended, or stayed, key parts of a Federal Communications Commission rule opening local phone monopolies to competition from long-distance carriers, cable TV operators and others.
Experts said the action could postpone competition in the $100 billion local phone market now controlled by the regional Baby Bell phone companies, until the case makes its way through the courts in coming months. A final decision could easily take a year or more.
""We're in for a very messy 1997, and the dust won't settle until fairly deep into 1997,"" said Henry Geller, a former top telecommunications official in the Commerce Department.
That, in turn, could delay the Baby Bells' entrance into the $70 billion long-distance market. The telecommunications law enacted in February lets the Bells offer long-distance only after they have opened their own markets to new rivals.
Even before the appeals court acted, government officials suggested a prolonged delay of the FCC's rules would make it tougher for regulators to allow the Bells to enter the long-distance business.
The FCC -- along with the Justice Department and state regulators -- has the final say over whether the Bells have satisfied a 14-point ""checklist"" that includes provisions of the now-suspended FCC rule.
""If the stay chills investment and retards new entry into the local marketplace, it may become more difficult for the (FCC) to authorise the Bell companies to offer long-distance (service),"" FCC Commissioner Susan Ness said in a speech only hours before the appeals court order.
And she noted that the Justice Department -- whose views ""must be accorded 'substantial weight'"" by the FCC -- already has signalled it will be reluctant to support Baby Bell entry as long as as the key parts of the FCC's proposed rules are on ice.
David Turetsky, deputy assistant attorney general in the department's antitrust division, said last month a stay would ""seriously impair"" the Bell entry process spelled out in the telecommunications law.
Any delays could delay the benefits of competition that Congress and President Clinton promised when enacting the law.
""The sooner there is competition in the local market, the consumer will benefit. And that's for sure when the Bells are allowed to go into long distance,"" said Geller.
""That will result in marketing and price wars. And the consumer again will greatly benefit.""
But Baby Bell stocks rallied after the ruling because state regulators were likely to call for lower discounts when the companies lease their phone lines to new competitors, analysts said.
GTE, the nation's largest local phone company -- which has spearheaded the legal challenge to the FCC rules -- jumped $3.625 to $42.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.
BellSouth added $2.50 to $38.875, Bell Atlantic gained $2.125 to $60.875, NYNEX rose $1.625 to $44.50, Ameritech was up $1.75 to $56.125 and Pacific Telesis rose $1.28 to $34.66, all on the NYSE.
The appeals court suspended the FCC rule until the judges consider a challenge to the measure early next year by GTE Corp., the Bells, other local carriers and state regulators.
They argue the FCC overstepped its power by requiring the Bells and local carriers to lease their phone lines to new competitors at steep discounts of up to 25 percent.
The court's action, for now, puts back in the hands of state regulators the responsibility to set such prices.
But local phone company officials discount the chance that competition will be delayed.
""The Telecommunications Act of 1996 passed by Congress in February is the law of the land and sets forth a timetable for the introduction of competition,"" said GTE Senior Vice President William Barr. He said that timetable is ""unaffected"" by the court's action and will proceed.

957,"Negotiations between American Airlines and its pilots union continued into the early hours of Friday, with neither side reporting any breakthrough that would avert a midnight strike at the nation's number-two carrier.
A federal mediator refereeing the talks at a downtown hotel informed the pilots that American had rejected a key union contract proposal covering who should pilot -- and at what pay -- the carrier's smaller American Eagle planes.
Mediators are shuttling back and forth between the two sides offering hypothetical ""what if"" proposals on a variety of issues in an effort the bring the two sides closer together and prevent a midnight Friday (0500 GMT Saturday) strike by the pilots which would throw the nation's air transport system into turmoil.
""They're going to work all night, throughout the night. All day (Friday),"" said Dave Bates, a spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association, which represents American's 9,000 pilots.
He said the union is ""disappointed at the lack of progress"" so far.
""We will continue to negotiate for as long as it takes. But (Friday) night at midnight the pilots will be on strike.""
Bates said no face-to-face talks had as yet been scheduled. An American spokesman would only say that the negotiations were continuing.
Going into the talks on Thursday evening, Kenneth Hipp, chairman of the National Mediation Board, said he was hopeful an agreement could be worked out in time to avert a strike.
The union had proposed that its pilots fly the American Eagle flights, but with lower pay than pilots flying the regular American aircraft. American, however, wants to continue using lower-paid commuter pilots from a different union to fly the smaller planes.
While the mediator has informed the union of the airline's rejection of the proposal on small planes, union official said the company itself has not notified them directly of that.
The dispute also centers around the pilots' pay. They now earn an average of about $120,000 a year.
The union earlier had said it would offer a new pay proposal -- probably less than the 11.5 percent over four years it had sought. The latest reported offer from American was a six percent boost over four years.
A strike would ground 2,200 American flights on Saturday and affect about 200,000 passengers. American, a unit of AMR Corp., accounts for about 20 percent of the nation's airline capacity.
The Fort Worth, Texas-based airline is trying to rebook passengers on other carriers and has already canceled nearly all international flights scheduled for Friday night.
American Airlines spokesman John Hotard said on Thursday the carrier was canceling 12 of its domestic flights scheduled for Friday. ""There are some small domestic airports where we have no permanent place to park the planes if there is a strike, so we decided to cancel those 12 flights.""
A Transportation Department official said a strike could cost the U.S. economy up to $200 million a day.
American Airlines Chairman Robert Crandall called for binding government arbitration of the dispute, a proposal the pilots have repeatedly rejected.
""I think mandatory binding arbitration should be required"" to prevent airline strikes, Crandall told a congressional subcommittee. Binding arbitration would mean both parties agreed to abide by the decision of an arbitrator.
""I seriously doubt we could accept that,"" union spokesman Wally Pitts said.
Crandall told a hearing of a House of Representatives Transportation subcommittee he was unsure if a strike could be avoided. ""We have two choices: we can either cave in or take a strike. A strike of 90 days will destroy this airline.""
As the talks entered their fourth day of intensive bargaining, President Bill Clinton was keeping a close watch.
Clinton could intervene and name an emergency board to try to resolve the issues. Under the Railway Labor Act, which also covers airlines, the president has the power to declare a national emergency to stop a strike and to keep planes flying for 60 days. The last time such an action was taken in an airlines strike was in 1966.
But at an unrelated news conference on Thursday, Clinton repeated that the parties should use the government mediator to reach an agreement.

960,"The Justice Department asked the Supreme Court Thursday to lift a lower court suspension of landmark federal rules aimed at prying open the nation's local telephone monopolies to competition.
The department, acting on behalf of the Federal Communications Commission, said the lower court's ""stay""  could hurt consumers by delaying the introduction of full-fledged competition in the $100 billion market.
The request comes after a U.S. appeals court based in St. Louis last week suspended key provisions of the FCC's ""interconnection"" order, which spells out how long-distance carriers, cable-TV operators and others could operate in the local phone market under the new telecommunications law.
The rules were frozen while the appeals court considers a challenge to the FCC order by GTE Corp., the so-called Baby Bell phone companies, other local carriers and state regulators who want the measure overturned.
They argue the FCC overstepped the power granted to it by Congress. The FCC, among other things, ordered the regional Bells and other local phone companies to lease their lines to new rivals at discounts of 17 percent to 25 percent.
The three-judge appeals court panel said the opponents ""have a better than even chance of convincing the court"" that the FCC's rules conflicted with the law.
But the Justice Department told the high court the appeals court action ""already imperils"" the timetable set by Congress for opening the local phone market.
""The stay draws into question not just the timing of competition in the local market, but also the timing of full entry by the Bell companies into the long-distance telephone market,"" the department added.
Long-distance carriers AT&amp;T Corp. and MCI Communications Corp., among other companies, also asked the high court on Thursday to lift the stay.
Lawyers were divided over the likely outcome.
""They have a decent shot at lifting the stay,"" said Alfred Mamlet of Steptoe &amp; Johnson. He noted the FCC's success last year in having Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens lift a lower court stay that had blocked a major FCC airwave auction.
But others were less sure. ""It's very difficult to predict,"" said Nicholas Allard of Latham &amp; Watkins.
The Justice Department request, along with those of the long-distance companies, is expected to go to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who oversees matters related to the St. Louis-based appeals court.

964,"Regulators proposed Thursday to set aside $2.3 billion a year to link schools and libraries to the Internet at discounted rates, but declined to endorse President Clinton's call to hook them up free of charge.
Eligible institutions could buy access to the computer network at discounts of 20 percent to 90 percent, under the plan offered by an eight-member board of state regulators and members of the Federal Communications Commission.
""Schools will be able to connect every single classroom to the Information Highway,"" said FCC Chairman Reed Hundt, who oversaw the panel.
""The ramp will be a high-speed, high-bandwidth, cutting-edge connection. The discounts, tailored to each school's individual level of need, will make building and maintaining the ramp truly affordable for every school.""
The Internet proposal is part of a broader plan to overhaul the multi-billion dollar ""universal service"" programme that ensures affordable phone service to rural communities and low-income neighbourhoods. The FCC must adopt rules by early May.
Officials hope the wide-ranging proposal, which stems from the new telecommunications law, eventually will generate lower phone rates through increased competition.
But some board members fear the plan -- to be paid for from the revenues of phone companies, cable TV operators and other communications carriers -- may prove too ambitious and ultimately push up rates.
""A universal service fund that taxes consumers billions of dollars a year is not only inconsistent with congressional intent, but could be extremely harmful nationwide to consumers,"" said Laska Schoenfelder, chairman of the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission.
Under the Internet provision, less well off institutions and those in out-of-the-way high-cost areas would be entitled to the larger discounts.
Officials said the average discount would be 60 percent. One-third of schools would get at least an 80 percent discount, and the poorest 15 percent would get a 90 percent discount.
""It is no secret and no surprise that access to technology in the nation's schools and classrooms is tremendously unequal,"" said Vice President Al Gore. ""Wealthier schools are twice as likely as poor schools to have Internet access, and wealthier students use computers 20 percent more than their poorer peers.""
But the plan stops short of the president's proposal to give schools and libraries free basic service, with the nation's communications carriers footing the bill.
In other areas, the board left many key provisions of its proposals vague, including the cost of the federal fund that would be used to subsidise carriers that offer phone service in high-cost rural areas and in low-income neighbourhoods.
Overriding the objections of some regulators, the board proposed to fund the federal programme through the interstate and intrastate revenues of telecommunications carriers.
Some state regulators objected to the use of intrastate revenues, saying such funds should be used only by the states to set up their own funds that would help provide distinct telecommunications services within their borders.
The board said that the current $3.50 a month subscriber line charge that residential customers now pay should not be increased. The charge is used to help fund universal service.
And it held out the prospect that the charge -- along with the ""access"" charges long-distance carriers pay to local phone companies to hook up to their networks -- could drop if the federal universal fund is indeed bankrolled by interstate and intrastate phone revenues.

978,"Regulators this week gave final approval to a technology standard for a new generation of high-definition digital television, setting off a race between computer makers and TV manufacturers to woo viewers.
The Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday approved the compromise standard hammered out last month between TV manufacturers, broadcasters and the computer industry.
Digital TV offers crystal-clear pictures and CD-quality sound. It is also expected to promote a ""computer friendly"" TV system that allows viewers to watch programmes while surfing the Internet over the same ""smart box.""
The new standard ""hastens convergence, transporting us into a competitive world of computer-friendly television sets and broadcast-friendly computers,"" commissioner Susan Ness said. ""Our decision also provides a springboard for global leadership in high-definition digital equipment and programming.""
The standard, among other things, covers how voice and video material will be attached to digital signals, how the signals will be ""compressed"" for transmission, and how they will be ""reopened"" at the TV receiver.
But not every detail is spelled out. Under the industry compromise, the standard does not specify the video format by which images will be put onto the screen, or ""scanned.""
Broadcasters and TV manufacturers had wanted to require a format known as ""interlace"" scanning. Computer companies argued that would stifle the convergence of TV and computer technologies. They wanted to mandate ""progressive"" scanning, which is better suited to computers, or no format at all.
Progressive scanning, used by most computers, updates every line of the TV picture at each pass. Interlaced scanning, used in exisiting television sets, updates every other line.
Because no scanning format was specified, the computer industry will be free to manufacture computers that use just progressive scanning. And TV manufacturers are ready to make sets that offer both interlace and progressive technology.
That sets up a competition between the two industries over how consumers will want to watch TV -- over a TV set or over a computer.
""Ultimately, the personal computer will be the preferred communications device in the household,"" said Paul Misener, manager of telecommunications and computer technology policy at Intel Corp., a major computer chip maker.
Not so fast, argue TV manufacturers.
""The computer people need to evaluate how the average consumer wants to get delivery to the home,"" said Lisa Fasold, a spokeswoman for the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association, an industry group.
""TV sets typically last a lot longer than computers. And they're much more simple to operate.""
In any event, industry officials agree that digital TV is likely to hasten the long-promised convergence of TV and computer technologies.
For example, sports fans will be able to watch a baseball game and split the screen of their machine to receive up-to-the-minute scores of other games over the Internet, according to industry officials.
TV manufacuters expect to begin bringing digital receivers to market in 1998. The new sets are expected to cost from $1,500 to $3,000. Prices are forecast to drop as broadcasters offer more digitally transmitted programmes, presumably boosting demand for digital TV.

Thomas let stand, without comment, a U.S. appeals court order suspending key parts of the Federal Communications Commission's ""interconnection"" rules. The FCC, long-distance giants AT&amp;T Corp. and MCI Communications Corp., and other phone companies had asked Thomas to restore the rules, but he rejected the request.
The FCC and the long-distance companies immediately submitted a new request for the high court to lift the lower court's ""stay."" The matter is expected to be taken up by the entire Supreme Court for consideration. In the meantime, deregulation of the nation's local phone monopolies remains in legal limbo.

Oral arguments are set for January.
GTE Corp., the Baby Bell phone companies, other local carriers and state regulators want to overturn the rules, saying the FCC overstepped its authority and usurped state powers to issue policies on pricing and other matters. Local companies and state regulators had requested the stay.
""We're gratified that the court declined to lift the stay. We are anticipating that the appeals process (against the FCC rules) will go forward and we think that is the right decision,"" said Bell Atlantic Corp. spokesman Jay Grossman.
The FCC and the long-distance companies had told the high court the stay ran counter to the telecom law and would hurt consumers by delaying the introduction of competition in the local market.
Thomas oversees appeals from the St. Louis-based appeals court.
The FCC rules, adopted in August, are intended to serve as a guide to negotiations between local phone companies and new rivals seeking to enter the local market.
They also are intended to serve as a reference for state arbitrators overseeing stalled negotiations.
The FCC rules, among other things, require the Bells and other local carriers to lease their phone lines to new competitors at steep discounts of up to 25 percent.
With the stay in place, state regulators will hold sway in determining what pricing and other policies will apply to the interconnection agreements between the Bells and GTE and new market entrants. Regulators in several states already have begun to issue preliminary arbitration agreements.
Scott Cleland, an analyst at the Washington Research Group, said the decision to leave the stay in place throws the process of telecommunications deregulation into uncertainty.
""It decentralizes the deregulation process down to the states and injects a lot of potential uncertainty over time,"" he said.

994,"The state of Alaska has asked the Federal Communications Commission to ban broadcast advertising of hard liquor, adding to the controversy over whether liquor ads should be allowed on television and radio.
Lawyers said the state's petition -- backed by former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop -- was significant.
It could be used at the least as a vehicle within the FCC to generate public debate on the issue, or as a catalyst leading to rules restricting broadcast liquor promotions.
""Whenever you have a state formally asking the FCC to step in, it legitimises the involvement of the commission for any 'doubting Thomases' that might remain,"" said attorney Nick Allard of Latham &amp; Watkins.
The FCC is divided over the issue. Chairman Reed Hundt favours banning the ads if TV stations refuse to abide by a voluntary ban. But two of the FCC's four commissioners have doubts over the FCC's authority to act in the matter.
FCC officials have yet to decide how to handle the Alaska request, which was submitted last month but drew little notice. They also have not yet decided how to respond to a recent bipartisan request from 26 members of Congress asking the FCC to open a formal investigation into broadcast liquor ads.
The split among commissioners has stymied action for now.
The Federal Trade Commission has opened a formal investigation into alcoholic beverage advertising on TV, both for liquor and beer. It is training its sights for now on distiller Joseph E. Seagram &amp; Sons and the Stroh Brewery Co. Seagram is a subsidiary of Montreal-based Seagram Co.
Alaska, in its petition, asserted that the FCC does have the jurisdiction to act and called for speedy action.
""Advertising of distilled spirits on television and radio will inevitably increase the use of this potent drug among the nation's young people,"" Alaska said in its petition, written by the state's attorney general, Bruce Botelho, and Assistant Attorney General Stephen Slotnick.
The petition cited data showing that Alaska's per-capita alcohol consumption was third-highest in the nation in 1994.
Alaska made its request after the nation's distillers last month ended their decades-old voluntary ban on broadcast ads. It had been in place since 1936 for radio and 1948 for TV.
In June, Seagram began airing TV ads for its Royal Crown whiskey in Texas.
Some dismissed Alaska's bid.
""It's fair to say the Alaska proposal and (the state's) alcohol problem have more to do with a lack of sunlight than whether Seagram advertises for its whiskey,"" said attorney Robert Corn-Revere of Hogan &amp; Hartson.
""An FCC ban of hard-liquor advertising would have a very hard chance of surviving judicial review,"" he added.
But others said a carefully crafted FCC proposal -- such as restricting the ads until after 10 p.m. or later -- could withstand judicial scrutiny. ""The courts have looked favourably on regulations designed to protect children,"" said attorney George Vradenberg of Latham &amp; Watkins.
Lawyers said the FCC must decide what, if any, action it wants to take. Some within the FCC suggest putting the Alaska and congressional requests out for public comment to allow the agency to learn more about the issue.
""Let's take it one step at a time,"" said an FCC official.

998,"A U.S. appeals court in St. Louis is set to hear arguments Friday on whether to reactivate or throw out a major Federal Communications Commission order opening the $100 billion local phone market to competition.
Lawyers and analysts predict the FCC and its long-distance phone company allies will lose the latest battle to GTE Corp., the Baby Bells, other local carriers and state regulators who want to overturn the order. It spells out how new entrants to the local phone business can link to Bell local networks.
The appeals court suspended the FCC order in October, pending Friday's case. ""The FCC faces a tough uphill battle,"" said attorney Alfred Mamlet of Steptoe &amp; Johnson. ""This case is headed for the Supreme Court.""
As a result, the FCC's ""interconnection"" order is likely to hang in legal limbo for at least a year while it is fought over in court -- a prospect analysts expect will cloud the phone industry's outlook and weigh on phone company stocks.
""It adds to the uncertainty out there,"" said analyst Scott Cleland of Schwab Washington Research Group.
The order was meant to implement the 1996 communications law, which allowed local and long-distance carriers, cable-TV operators and others into each other's business.
The appeals court, in suspending the order, sided with the local carriers and state regulators who charged that the FCC overstepped its power by issuing national rules on pricing and other matters instead of leaving those issues to the states.
The court wrote that opponents ""have a better than even chance of convincing the court the the FCC's pricing rules conflict with the plain meaning"" of the 1996 law.
With the order expected to remain on ice for a while, lawyers and analysts said state regulators and federal judges will have the chief job of prying open local phone monopolies to long-distance companies such as AT&amp;T Corp. and others.
FCC Chairman Reed Hundt warned that piecemeal deregulation -- with judges around the nation ultimately deciding terms for opening local phone markets -- would have a ""very negative impact"" on industry efforts to raise capital.
FCC officials have said the case will not be resolved before the high court until spring 1998, at the earliest.
The order requires the Bells and other local carriers to lease their phone lines to new competitors at discounts of up to 25 percent.
The FCC also ordered local carriers to ""unbundle"" their local networks into pieces -- such as call-switching devices and operator and directory assistance -- so new competitors can lease components to complete their own networks.
The ""unbundled elements"" were to be priced at competitive levels based on the cost of new and more-efficient facilities.
In the meantime, state regulators have been issuing decisions on terms for opening the local markets. FCC Chairman Hundt said that despite the suspension of his agency's order, 29 of 31 states so far have adopted the FCC pricing policies.
But even those decisions are being challenged. GTE Corp. in particular, as well as AT&amp;T, have appealed some of those rulings to federal courts around the country.
Henry Geller, a former FCC general counsel, blamed the legal morass on Congress, saying lawmakers ""botched"" the job of writing the 1996 law. ""The whole idea was that the courts weren't going to be determining this,"" he said.

999,"Ameritech Corp. Thursday became the first Baby Bell phone company to seek federal approval under the new telecommunications law to offer long-distance service from its regional calling area.
The Chicago-based carrier asked the Federal Communications Commission for permission to provide long-distance service to residents in Michigan, one of five midwestern states in which the company now provides local service. Ameritech has 3.5 million customers in Michigan.
Under last year's law, Ameritech and other Bells can offer long-distance service from within their local-calling regions once regulators are convinced the Bells have opened their local network to new rivals such as AT&amp;T Corp. and others.
The Bells can then provide customers the convenience of one-stop shopping involving local and long-distance service.
""It's the single largest potential change that can occur quickly in the communications market,"" said analyst Scott Cleland of Schwab Washington Research Group.
""If Ameritech gets a yes, it's easy for them to gain customers."" The company has 11 million residential customers in Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Indiana and Ohio.
FCC Chairman Reed Hundt said Ameritech's more than 4,000-page application ""opens a new chapter"" in the implementation of the landmark telecom law.
But the application is sure to face tough scrutiny at the agency and from other government regulators.
Long-distance giants AT&amp;T Corp. and MCI Communications Corp. called on the FCC to reject the move, saying Ameritech has not yet opened its local phone market.
The FCC -- after consulting with the Justice Department and Michigan regulators as well as seeking public comment -- has 90 days to decide whether Ameritech's entry is in the public interest.
In particular, the carrier must meet a detailed 14-point checklist showing it has opened its local network in Michigan to new competitors.
""The American people have called for choice,"" said Ameritech Chief Executive Richard Notebart. ""Congress responded last year by passing a law that accelerates a competitive marketplace for all communications services. Ameritech is stepping forward to make this happen.""
AT&amp;T, however, called Ameritech's bid ""clearly premature.""
""It's obvious that real local service competition does not yet exist in Ameritech's Michigan territory,"" said AT&amp;T spokesman Ray O'Connell.
O'Connell accused Ameritech of trying to delay competition by ignoring orders from Michigan regulators to open its local network. He pointed out that Michigan's attorney general has intervened against Ameritech in a case pending before the state's supreme court.
""By any competitive or public interest standard, Ameritech's application to begin offering in-region long-distance service should be rejected,"" said Jonathan Sallet, MCI's chief policy counsel.
The No. 2 long-distance carrier said that Ameritech still controls 99.6 percent of Michigan's local phone customers, and that only four companies offer local service in Michigan.
None of the big three long-distance carriers -- AT&amp;T, MCI and Sprint -- now offer such service.
In any event, Ameritech's bid is expected to put pressure on other Bells to seek similar permission soon. Nynex Corp., which serves the Northeast United States, is considered a top candidate to seek approval in the near future.

1003,"Russia is trying to shift financing of its tarnished gold sector to commercial banks while keeping control of exports, putting it on a collision course with the banks who say sales abroad are what interest them.
Moscow bullion officials view recent Central Bank decisions outlining new procedures for working with gold as a cautious, experimental step toward opening one of the country's most closed industries, the banks say.
""Administrative measures in Russia always mean something,"" said Dmitry Smirnov, head of precious metals operations at Vneshtorgbank, commenting on whether recent changes detailing accounting procedures for working with gold were Soviet-style bureaucratic paper-shuffling or more significant.
But he said: ""Honestly, I wouldn't expect a sharp rise in output any time soon.""
Russian bullion officials say they want to open up the domestic market, since the federal budget can no longer finance gold output or keep the state's strategic reserves well-stocked.
Canadian industry sources say Russia has the world's third-largest untapped gold reserves but is only the world's fifth-largest producer, a fact that reflects the difficulty it is having in channeling funds to mines.
Output in 1995 fell to about 130 tonnes and will slip in 1996 and 1997. About 130 banks have the right to trade in gold domestically but only five to eight can export gold abroad.
Banks financed only five tonnes of output last year.
Western bullion bankers say bank-financed output makes Russia a potential loose cannon on world markets, since it could quickly send output soaring.
Gold, which struck three-year lows earlier this week but has picked up slightly since, hovered around $368 an ounce on Thursday on the London Metal Exchange.
Domestic banks, some of which bought government gold-backed certificates in 1991 which they cashed in for metal, may already have significant stockpiles of gold which they are unable to export due to strict quota and licensing rules.
Boris Yeltsin's press service said on Thursday the president had decreed that Russia would not issue certificates backed by about 30 tonnes of gold as planned last year.
""I know that there are a lot of banks with a lot of gold that they are just waiting to sell abroad,"" said Dmitry Parmeshin, head of Inkombank's precious metals sales section.
""We all want to take this stuff out if the (domestic) market becomes liberalised enough.""
Bankers declined to put a figure on the number of tonnes of gold held in Russian commercial banks, but one said the figure could be at least in the dozens.
The Central Bank in October introduced new accounting procedures for banks seeking to work on the domestic gold market. But the institution still largely controls exports through quotas and licences.
Interfax news agency quoted Central Bank precious metals director Sergei Kyshtymov as saying the rules would soon be simplified further.
""This can be viewed as the first step toward a more open gold market in Russia,"" said Sergei Brazhenko, deputy head of precious metals department at Rossiisky Kredit, one of the few banks with a licence to export gold abroad.
""The task is to hook up our output with world market demand, given that our domestic consumption is low.""
Bullion bankers said domestic consumers bought 15 tonnes of gold last year, mostly as jewellery -- but they said trade restrictions hid the fact that consumer demand was higher.
""Once things become truly liberalised, the domestic market could really explode,"" Parmeshin said.

1004,"Russia's aluminium industry has roared back to life with strong 1996 output figures and forecasts of small growth, but analysts say no new investments which could fundamentally reshape the sector are on the horizon.
""The situation for the Russian aluminium industry is quite stable and healthy,"" said a London-based spokesman for Trans-World Commodities, which controls major stakes in key Russian smelters.
The Kontsern Alyuminiy producers' group put 1996 Russian primary aluminium output at 2.87 million tonnes, up from earlier estimates of 2.79 million and above 1995's 2.67 million.
It said output in Russia, one of the world's top producers with 15 percent of global output, would rise 1.5-2.0 percent in 1997, but it had not yet compiled export data.
Russia's total primary aluminium capacity -- some still idle after a two-year global output-cutting deal expired in spring 1996 -- is about 3.20 million tonnes.
Russia is one of the least transparent of world producers and sensitive markets are keen to know of plans to increase or improve production.
""There was a generally-held view in early 1996 that output would fall back because of alumina shortages,"" said Nigel Kieser, mining analyst at Paribas Capital Markets in London.
But he said Western trading houses became more active in Russia last year to smoothe out raw materials supply problems and that the 1996 output figure was strong but not surprising.
While output may inch up this year, big infrastructural changes are not yet on the horizon -- in spite of the fact that smelters plan strategic alliances with each other and Western commodities houses are major shareholders in some plants.
""I don't see any serious investments in modernisation in Russiam aluminium in 1997,"" said a senior Alusuisse-Lonza Holding AG source, citing fears over shareholder rights that scare deep-pocketed investors.
Russian smelters spent 1996 complaining about rail tariff and production costs and can still only dream of the integration and long-term energy contracts that Western smelters have.
While these two items are still major factors dividing the Russian industry into the profitable Siberian smelters and loss-making plants in western Russia, other concerns will come to the fore in 1997.
""Companies are going to focus on the raw materials question a lot -- on how to get alumina,"" said the Alusuisse source.
Seventy percent of the region's alumina, the raw material used to make aluminium, is in former Soviet countries like Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Tajikistan, and the old planned-economy Soviet-era links that once guaranteed steady supplies have disintegrated.
Russia has only two functioning alumina plants which meet less than one third of demand, and smelters are hungrily eyeing Kazakhstan's Pavloday and Ukraine's Nikolayevsky alumina plants.
One metals source said smelters were so desperate for alumina that they were extracting it from the mineral nepheline, in a costly and obscure procedure used almost nowhere else in the world, instead of from the more traditional bauxite.
Scarce raw materials are the Achilles heel of Russia's big southern Siberian smelters, which account for about 90 percent of Russian primary aluminium output and are fuelled by vast amounts of electricity generated by Siberia's mighty rivers.
The Bratsk, Irkutsk, Sayansk and Krasnoyarsk smelters are at least 4,000 km (2,500 miles) from the nearest port-based export outlet and functioning alumina sources -- vast distances which carry expensive rail tariffs.
Russia's largest alumina plant, Achinsky, is in the region, but it is bankrupt and barely producing at any of its capacity of 400,000 tonnes a year.

1008,"President Boris Yeltsin's surgery on Tuesday might be a heart stopper for some volatile commodities and currency markets, but recent history proves Russian oil and gas exports are unfazed by Kremlin dramas.
Traders have seen tanks fire at Russia's White House, cloak-and-dagger power struggles and war in oil-rich Chechnya -- and each time, they say, Russian supplies of oil and natural gas to Europe and the Mediterranean have held steady.
Russia is the world's third-largest crude oil producer and single biggest natural gas producer; its energy heats and powers much of Europe and is a multi-billion dollar cash cow for Russia no matter who sits in the Kremlin hot seat.
This time, with Yeltsin under the knife this morning for a gruelling, hours-long heart bypass, should be no different.
""Politics don't affect us,"" said trader Vladimir Solovyov of Nafta-Moskva, one of Russia's leading oil exporters.
""We are more interested in things like government decrees saying 'export tariff introduced' or 'export tariff scrapped'.
Yeltsin's surgery began against domestic and international worries that if the operation fails, Russia could plunge into political uncertainty that could hit oil and gas exports.
With about one third of Russia's 6.2 million barrels per day output exported outside the former Soviet Union, and with Russian natural gas keeping one third of Europe warm, it is easy to see why traders worry about supply.
But when Russian oil exports do fluctuate, it is on less dramatic events, like storms at the Black Sea export outlet of Novorossiisk, one-off government supply programmes to former Soviet allies and which oil company is flavour of the month with export officials.
Gas exports can fluctuate on occasional explosions in Russia's gas pipeline system, the largest in the world.
Analysts said that with domestic demand flat while the Russian economy recovers, exports will be stable near-term.
Industry sources said there is no danger of conservative officials playing with the taps while Yeltsin was incapacitated, but they said some risk-averse European buyers could insist on contract terms less beneficial to Russian exporters.
""Our partners could get worried and demand terms not as attractive to us,"" said a trade financer at International Economic Cooperation, or MES, another leading oil exporter.
Others said money, not politics, motivated exports -- and with domestic oil prices below world levels, it is not hard to make money exporting the stuff.
""We like good prices on world markets,"" Nafta-Moskva's Solovyov said.
Political tensions in other major oil exporting countries often cause benchmark London and New York oil prices to leap over worries about supply disruptions.
Nervous International Petroleum Exchange traders swung spot prices in London when Yeltsin sacked maverick security tsar General Alexander Lebed last month.
But Moscow oil traders and analysts said that everyone should just calm down.
""This stuff (oil) is scheduled for export months in advance and it's technically very difficult to fiddle with the taps,"" said energy analyst Peter Houlder of CentreInvest consultancy.
Even the conservatives who covet Yeltsin's Kremlin seat remember the good old Soviet oil-boom days, when exports -- not disruptions to them -- were the key to power and wealth and enticed the Soviet Union to crank up output and become the world's largest oil producer.

1012,"Russian parliamentarians, in a stinging blow to foreign oil investors, on Thursday said they would ask lawmakers to reject a bill outlining oil reserves open to production-sharing agreements.
The bill, a list of about 250 oil fields holding 38 percent of proven Russian oil reserves, is a key step towards unlocking billions of dollars in planned and proposed investments in Russian oil, including a huge project by Amoco Corp.
But members of the audit chamber of parliament told a news conference they would ask Duma (lower chamber) deputies to reject the law early next month.
The call for rejection, likely to be accepted, is a slap in the face for Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, whom foreign oil investors have considered their guardian angel in Russia and who has been instrumental in getting energy deals off the ground.
It is also the latest sign that Moscow, in a quiet change of policy, is getting tough with potential Western oil investors and seeking ways to give its own oil companies, which hold licences to most of the fields, a chance to get on their feet and compete with Western majors.
""It's quite a major setback,"" said a senior European energy consultant who asked not to be named. ""There's a real feeling in Russia of ""why should we give up any of this -- it's ours'.""
Duma Deputy Yuri Boldyrev, who is deputy chairman of the audit chamber, said the chamber had rejected the reserves list because government officials had not presented financial analyses proving that the fields would earn Russia more money faster if developed on a production-sharing basis.
Production-sharing contracts bring Western oil firms into risky countries by allowing them to finance and develop oil production through the sale of some output on world markets to cover costs and generate returns. The rest of the oil goes to the host country, which also get royalties and profit taxes.
Under the scheme, ordinary tax regimes are not applicable, giving the investments an acceptable return.
Boldyrev said foreign investors would not be worried by the chamber's rejection and said Moscow should slash the number of reserves open to output-sharing to 10 or 15 a year.
But senior oil executives are likely to be annoyed.
""We are of course worried about anything that slows the process down,"" said Dan Westbrook, senior vice-president and resident manager of Amoco Eurasia Petroleum Company in Moscow.
While officials recommended that the field Amoco is eyeing, Priobsk, be included eventually in the production-sharing list, they said two prize, giant fields -- Samotlor and Krasnoleninskoye -- would not be tendered to foreign investors.
Amoco and Russian oil firm YUKOS have a preliminary $50 billion production-sharing deal to tap Priobsk, one of Russia's largest oil fields, in western Siberia's Tyumen region.
But negotiations have slowed, partly because parliament has not yet approved the reserves list.
More bureaucratic delays appear to be on the horizon, blocking some $50-$70 billion in planned foreign investments in Russian oil and retarding potential projects.
""We need a host of laws clarifying on what grounds a specific field should be included in the list,"" said parliamentary auditor Mikhail Beskhmelnitsyn.
Boldyrev, complaining that Russia's black gold goes into a black hole when oil firms underpay taxes to state coffers, said the chamber also rejected the reserves list because output-sharing contracts might award too many tax breaks to companies.
Russia, the world's third largest producer of crude oil, last year passed a production-sharing law but only after revising it to meet demands by domestic lobbyists worried about the country's resources being exploited too cheaply by foreigners.

1024,"Russia's Gazprom natural gas monopoly plans to double exports to Europe by 2010, mostly via its ambitious $40 billion Yamal pipeline project, but energy analysts said the timing could be wrong.
""There's a market problem (with oversupply in Europe), and the cost of developing the Yamal field will be too high,"" said a senior European energy specialist familiar with the project.
""Europe is at saturation level for the next 10 years or so, so Gazprom is 5-10 years too early.""
The Yamal-Europe project envisions building a gas pipeline network across 4,107 km (2,550 miles) from Russia's vast Arctic Yamal peninsula reserves to Germany via Belarus and Poland.
Gazprom wants to take advantage of rising European demand.
To help raise capital for Yamal, RAO Gazprom is offering American Depositary Shares as part of a plan to sell a total nine percent stake abroad.
""Europe can hardly wait for this project,"" said Alexander Litvinov, Gazprom's chief public relations specialist.
A company statement said: ""The company faces significant requirements for capital expenditures.""
The Yamal system, to be built in stages and linking with existing pipelines in some places, would have an initial capacity of 83 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year, including around 52 bcm to Western Europe.
Gazprom said the Yamal-Europe pipeline would boost Russia's export capacity to 124 billion bcm by 1997 and 154 bcm by 1999. Sales outside the former Soviet Union were 117.4 bcm in 1995.
The company wants annual exports to rise by 50 bcm by 2010.
Gazprom has won big Western credits to build European parts of the Yamal link into Poland's grid and Belarus, but it has not won financing for the main part of the system or to boost output at Yamal itself, which it hopes to begin doing by 2000.
Pierre Bauquis, special adviser to the president of French company Total SA, told an energy conference in the Kazakh capital Almaty last week that Russia had huge gas reserves but big financial constraints.
""Yamal is not needed before 2010,"" he said.
He said netbacks (a key indicator of profitability) on Yamal gas to Germany today were negative, ""so Yamal is not obvious from an economic standpoint.""
Gazprom sees Yamal as the goose that will lay the golden egg, since the area has recoverable reserves of 10,400 bcm, or 20 percent of Russia's total proven reserves.
But Yamal gas, some under permafrost, is in a remote area and is quite expensive to recover.
Some analysts say it may be cheaper to tap and transport Algerian and Norwegian gas to European markets than to extract Yamal gas in the volumes and time-frame Gazprom plans.
Russian gas already accounts for 60 percent of Europe's total gas imports. Russia has more than one-third of world gas reserves and 26 percent of output, and is the world's single largest producer, with output of 556 bcm last year.
Gazprom accounts for 94 percent of Russian gas output and transports nearly all of it. The firm wants output to rise to 820 bcm a year by 2010.
Russia exports only 20 percent of its output, and declining industrial consumption at home has left Russia with an oversupply. Europe is also flush with supplies, though demand is set to rise.
""The fact that Gazprom does not have its own financing for Yamal and that it has not been able to find domestic or foreign financing (for the main part of the project) speaks quite negatively about its economics,"" said the European source.

1025,"Russia's state oil pipeline firm Transneft on Tuesday cast a shadow of doubt over the go-ahead for a proposed new pipeline across Russia when it said it had demanded a stronger role in the strategic deal.
Transneft spokesman Ravil Polyanin said the monopoly, which owns and operates Russia's vast, existing oil pipeline network, was not content to play the role of daily operator and wanted an equity stake in the important project.
""We want to be a shareholder,"" he said. ""But the oil firms have not valued our technical expertise highly enough.""
Companies holding a 50 percent stake in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) that will build the proposed link are Chevron, Russian LUKoil, Mobil Corp , Rosneft, Oman Oil Company, British Gas Plc, Agip SpA of Italy, Kazakh Munaigaz and Oryx Energy Company.
Kazakhstan, Oman and Russia hold the remaining 50 percent.
A CPC official, speaking after a meeting last week in Moscow to try to push a long-delayed restructuring agreement ahead, said the deal would be signed next month.
But the consortium has not made any formal announcements on what was achieved and shareholders declined to give details.
The CPC consortium, in one of the former Soviet Union's most ambitious and important energy projects, wants to build a $1.5 billion pipeline from Kazakhstan's vast Tengiz oilfield through war-torn Chechnya to Russia's Black Sea port of Novorossiisk.
But a cloak of secrecy around last week's meeting raised questions over whether the group had overcome hurdles that have dogged it in the past, including prickly issues of Transneft's participation and of corporate and international financing.
""The transition committee successfully completed negotiations on restructuring and the final agreement will be signed in Moscow on December 6,"" said the CPC official, who added that he was not allowed to provide any details.
But several shareholders said the deadline was optimistic and stumbling blocks remained. ""The subject is extremely sensitive and I cannot say one single word about CPC,"" said a Western oil executive whose company is a CPC shareholder.
A second similar Western source said: ""I'm reluctant to say the deal is going to be signed on x or y date.""
Polyanin said it was premature to say all outstanding problems had been resolved, adding that Transneft would seek to persuade consortium members to reallocate equity stakes.
He said Transneft was lobbying Deputy Fuel and Energy Minister Anatoly Shatalov to push CPC to give Transneft a share.
Transneft has a big strategic card to play, since it will operate the pipeline and help set and collect transit fees that will fill its coffers. If the fees are too high, it will throw a wrench into the economics of the deal for the Western partners.
CPC's main customers are Chevron and Mobil. Desperate to ship more oil out of their Tengiz project, they are already sending crude to Western markets via unconventional routes through Azerbaijan, Georgia and Finland on trains and barges.
CPC sources said Transneft's role and Russian taxes were the main issues preventing a final agreement for the pipeline which should eventually carry up to 70 million tonnes of oil a year (1.4 million barrels per day).
They also said it was a barometer of the extent to which Caspian onshore and offshore oil and pipeline projects will be able to get off the ground, and of Russia's willingness to see oil-rich former Soviet republics develop their own energy deals.

1036,"Western oil companies frustrated by Moscow's foot-dragging on foreign investment laws presented a study Tuesday designed to convince officials that Russia will take the lion's share of rewards in oil deals.
The study, outlining the benefits from six flagship production-sharing contracts requiring $129 billion in expenditure, could be the evidence nationalist and conservative parliamentarians need to pass energy and tax laws in 1997 to get the projects off the ground.
Foreign oil firms have to date invested only a tiny fraction of that total, citing high taxes, a flawed production-sharing law and Moscow's inability to ratify a list of reserves open to output-sharing deals.
""No investments are going to happen until there's a firm legal base,"" said a top Western oil executive who declined to be identified, speaking after a conference where the study was presented.
The document, prepared by the Petroleum Advisory Forum, or PAF, and a group of Russian academics, said six major international projects requiring $102 billion in Western funding over 57 years would generate $591 billion in total benefits, with Russia getting 87 percent of the total.
The deals would create up to 550,000 jobs, raise real gross domestic product by $450 billion, boost state revenues by $257 billion and Russian private sector revenues by $258 billion.
The foreign side would reap $76 billion in benefits, including $40 billion in foreign investor profits.
""With the overwhelming majority of benefits accruing to Russia, these projects will make an important contribution towards Russia's future economic growth and to the stability of its emerging market economy,"" a study group statement said.
Russian officials have blocked passage of key energy laws, saying they want to prevent what they call a fire-sale of Russia's natural resources to the West and in effect hampering Western investment in Russia's oil sector.
""Under the current licensing regime regulating the use of subsoil resources and the current gross revenue-based tax system, large-scale investments in the Russian oil industry are not forthcoming,"" the statement said.
Deputy Fuel and Energy Minister Valery Garipov said the study showed the necessity of Western investment in the oil industry, but he said Russian companies would have to have at least a 50 percent stake in production-sharing deals.
""We don't need stop-gap loans -- we need long-term investments,"" he told the same conference.
""Domestic investments are not appearing,"" he said, adding that only Western-financed production-sharing contracts would reverse Russia's steep oil output decline. ""There are Russian banks that bought oil companies, but where are their investments?""
The study said that for each dollar directly invested in the oil sector, an additional 90 cents in revenues would be generated in related domestic industries.

1037,"Azerbaijan is proving more successful in attracting foreign oil investment dollars than big brother Russia, but the Caspian state must still deal with Moscow if it wants to become a major world energy player.
In the latest deal underscoring the shift, Azeri oil officials said Amoco Corp, Unocal Corp, Japan's Itochu Corp and Saudi Arabia's Delta Nimir would initial a $1.5 billion agreement with Azeri officials on December 14 to tap unexplored reserves in the Azeri sector of the Caspian.
The deal is the fourth multi-billion-dollar project Baku has won since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 and takes place as a chill settles over Western oil companies struggling to push Russian-based deals through a legal maze.
""I think there's really a question of how much Russia really wants the investment,"" said one Western oil executive in Moscow. ""With the Azeris, it's never really a question.""
Douglas Hill, resident manager of Amoco unit Amoco Caspian Sea Petroleum Ltd in Baku, said the Azeri government had done much to make deals attractive to foreign investors.
""There's a strong realisation here that some assistance is needed and that oil is going to be the primary driver of the economy,"" he said.
Actual foreign oil investment in Russia has all but dried up as Moscow struggles to pass tax and resource laws backing investors' projects and is less than $1 billion out of a planned $60 billion. No deals are close to the production stage.
In contrast, Azerbaijan's flagship $8 billion Azerbaijan International Operating Company (AIOC) project grouping 13 international oil companies is scheduled to start pumping in the third quarter of next year.
Moscow is not indifferent to the change in focus to high-yielding Caspian reserves and has pushed to get Russian oil giant LUKoil involved in the projects -- partly, some analysts say, in exchange for not arguing over who owns Caspian oil.
Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Russia all border the sea. Russia says its resources should be shared equally but Azerbaijan follows a sectoral approach and is proceeding with deals in its area.
""Of course, Azerbaijan is now our competitor,"" said Nikolai Bolmasov, deputy head of the Russian Fuel and Energy Ministry's section for cooperation with the Commonwealth of Independent States.
He said Moscow was ""analysing"" Azerbaijan's role in landing foreign oil deals but declined to say if the ministry would produce policy directives on the issue.
Caspian oil projects are next door to the Middle East Gulf region, which contains nearly 70 percent of world oil reserves and produces one quarter of global oil supplies. They will make Azerbaijan and neighbouring Kazakhstan big competitors to Russia.
""Over the next three or four years, production will shift from Siberia to higher yielding Caspian and Sakhalin projects,"" Stephen O'Sullivan, associate director of oil and gas at MC Securities in London, said in a recent interview.
But the deals on Far Eastern Sakhalin island do not have Russian majors as shareholders, and analysts say LUKoil's participation in leading Azeri deals has kept Moscow quiet on the Caspian status issue.
LUKoil could yet join the latest Caspian group, which will tap the unexplored Dan-Ulduzu and Azhrafe reserves.
One hand Moscow has not forced is the question of how the region's oil will be transported to Western markets.
Russia is keen to earn crude oil transit tariffs and control supplies, but knows some new pipelines will probably go through Turkey due to worries over increased tanker traffic through the Bosphorus.

1038,"Russia, dramatically changing its approach to foreign investment in its huge oil sector, said on Monday that new domestic companies, not Western majors, would be given the upper hand in future billion-dollar energy deals.
Vladimir Tumarkin, chief spokesman for Rosneft, the state oil holding company which is being privatised and the state's agent in production-sharing deals, said the days of foreign oil firms winning majority stakes to tap Russian reserves were over.
""We have a new approach,"" Tumarkin said. ""We do not wish to repeat the so-called mistakes of earlier deals, when majority stakes went to foreign companies and Russia was left out.""
He told Reuters he was referring to three, high-profile deals with Western and Japanese oil investors off Russia's Far Eastern island of Sakhalin -- deals in which Russian equity and ownership play a relatively minor role.
As a test of the new approach to Western oil investors, he said Amoco Corp, Exxon and Texaco of the United States, Total SA of France and Norsk Hydro ASA of Norway -- all bidders in a recent tender to develop reserves in Timan-Pechora -- would be asked to form a consortium and to give at least a 50 percent stake to Russian companies.
The companies had bid, some individually, some together, to develop up to 200 million tonnes of crude oil in the Khoreiverskaya Basin in oil-rich northern Timan-Pechora.
""The philosophy behind investing in Russian oil has changed,"" Tumarkin said, adding that Rosneft would hold talks with the companies next week.
Foreign oil investors are already wondering about the extent to which Moscow truly wants outside help in developing reserves in Russia, the world's third largest crude oil producer.
Lots of competitive investment dollars have gone to energy-rich Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, where deals have got off the ground faster and more smoothly.
But while Russia has said it wants to turn around its flagging oil sector, where output has declined by 46 percent since the mid-1980s, its newly-privatised oil companies may not be able to carry the banner.
""The question is, do the Russian companies have the financing for all this,"" said oil analyst James Bunch at Renaissance Capital in Moscow.
Some of Russia's vertically-integrated oil companies have the makings of future stars, with savvy management and reserves that put them in the world's big league. But many of them are weighed down by non-payments and corporate taxes that leave them little free cash to invest.
""I don't think the size of stakes (in production-sharing contracts) makes that much difference to Western companies -- what is important is the economics of the deal,"" said oil and gas analyst Stuart Amor of CS First Boston in London.
He said it was doubtful whether Russian companies could find the money needed in the near-term to work with foreign investors and that crude oil output levels were, as a result, unlikely to rise significantly.
U.S. energy companies have invested less than $1 billion of the $60 billion they have said they plan to commit to Russian oil deals, complaining of political and legal risk.
Prominent projects -- including the $40 billion international Timan Pechora Company deal, and Amoco's $50 billion plan with Russian oil group YUKOS to tap Priobsk reserves -- are beset by quibbles with the Russians over equity stakes, contributions, and asset valuations.
""They're obviously not going to like it,"" said one Western analyst of Russia's new approach. ""But I don't know if it will drive them out.""

1040,"Russia, whose sudden introduction of export curbs each winter can wreak havoc in the world's heavy fuel oil market, is unsure about what to do this season, traders said on Tuesday.
Most traders expected an export duty of up to 80,000 roubles per tonne of mazut, as heavy fuel oil is known in Russian. But Moscow is keeping the industry guessing longer than usual on the timing and size of a possible tariff.
""My crystal ball is broken, so you'll have to ask somebody else,"" said a senior source at a major Western trading house.
Yevgeny Lukashov, adviser to the Federal Energy Commission and close to the government's debate on how to regulate mazut exports, said the cabinet might debate the issue on Tuesday.
But he had no idea what the outcome would be.
Moscow has in recent years raised mazut export tariffs or banned deliveries abroad outright, which has conditioned traders to expect a restriction each winter.
But some industry sources questioned why Russia -- which usually slaps the curbs on in November to ensure cheap heating fuel supplies for factories and power plants -- is already in December with no decision yet on the matter.
Sarah Anderson of Energy Security Analysis Inc in Washington said Russia, which must ship some mazut to domestic users along its waterways before they freeze, was defeating the purpose of bolstering supplies by waiting so long.
""If you don't have a curb in place by October, the purpose is defeated. They really have to start dealing with this in October, because January is too late.""
Other sources said the uncertainty over tariffs reflected not careful planning by Moscow but haphazard and inefficient decision-making based on Soviet-era thinking.
""It's item number 999 on a list of a thousand things to do,"" said Matthew Sagers of PlanEcon in Washington. But he said any curbs would not hit export levels because Russia was oversupplied with mazut in winter.
Others say demand at home is exceptionally difficult to fathom, since there is no domestic market and enterprises using the material are usually verging on bankruptcy.
""They'll in theory use as much as they can and pay as little as they can,"" one trader said, referring to traditional wasteful use of resources at factories and heating plants.
The lack of transparency makes it nearly impossible for traders to estimate how much extra mazut Russia needs during the winter and, correspondingly, what kind of tariff Moscow might slap on to achieve the supply balance it needs at home.
""It ends up going straight to users, so who knows how big the market is,"" a Russian trader said.
Some industry sources said an apparent shift in policy on the part of Russia's domestic oil companies was adding to the murkiness of the situation this year.
A second, senior Russian trader said the old logic of producers seeking to export to free up storage tank space and get cash, even at a net loss, was disappearing.
""The logic now is that it really might be better not to produce at all,"" he said, citing low refinery runs as producers seek to export crude oil instead.
The trader was one of a handful who thought there would be no curbs. ""My gut feeling is there won't be a tariff. It's senseless. It could absolutely stop the trade,"" he said.
Others said a tariff would only dent export volumes.
""Refineries are very short of crude oil these days,"" said a Russian source at a Swiss trader. ""But they'll still try to push something out (on world markets).""

He said Russian primary aluminium output this year would be 2.79 million tonnes, a 1.5 percent increase on 1995's level, and 1997 production could rise by 1.5 to 2.0 percent.
The group sees Russia's 1996 primary aluminium exports at 2.37 million tonnes compared with 2.11 million in 1995. Prokopov declined to forecast 1997 exports.
Kontsern Alyuminiy said exports of primary aluminium, alloys and semi-fabricated items over January-October had already risen seven percent from year-ago levels.
The State Customs Committee puts the rise at 16 percent.
Prokopov said he was confused by low London Metal Exchange prices and said he saw no basis for weak prices in view of supply and demand patterns.
""I can't prove there's speculation going on, but I look at the charts and these are what the facts lead me to think.""
""Some noise has appeared in the West that Russia has cranked things up, which is not really true. There's no reason for the fall in prices,"" he said, citing lower world stocks.
But he said Russia's survival as an aluminium power was not in question, since the Siberian smelters, accounting for 90 percent of output, had captive, plentiful sources of hydroelectricity, a main cost in production.
Depressed prices would be the motor for Russian smelters to consolidate operations as they completed their transition from state-run enterprises to market-nimble corporations.
""The Russian aluminium industry should be consolidated and act as a large transnational company like Alcoa or Pechiney,"" Prokopov said. ""We won't be like Gazprom,"" he said, referring to the natural gas monopoly. ""But there will be three or four teams that will act on world markets.""
The process has already started. Siberian Aluminium, a so-called financial industrial group, includes Bratsk -- the world's biggest smelter -- and Sayansk, Trans-World Group, Zalogbank, and Kazakhstan's Pavlodar alumina plant.
The Krasnoyarsk smelter is in a group with the Achinsk alumina plant and wants to bring Ukraine's Nikolayevskiy alumina plant on board.
""Integration could have a positive affect,"" Prokopov said. ""It will lead to expense rationalisation, lower costs and consolidated balances. Smelters are in a satisfactory state, but we want better -- we want more resources to modernise them.""

1045,"The world's biggest aluminium smelter, Russia's Bratsk plant, opposes any output-cutting schemes and wants to boost production and to compete better on world markets, a senior company official said on Thursday.
""Bratsk is an inveterate supporter of market-economy principles and not of schemes that violate such principles or of anti-monopoly laws,"" said Yuri Shlaifshtein, a Bratsk board member based in London who conducts corporate strategy and watches London Metal Exchange prices.
""Each company should choose the strategy best suiting it.""
AOOT Bratsky Aluminievy Zavod (BrAZ), based in southern Siberia close to plentiful hydroelectric power, has already increased output of A7 higher-grade material to 69 percent of total production from 30 percent.
Shlaifshtein declined to provide production figures but said competitiveness abroad and at home were essential to Bratsk's long-term strategy.
An independent metals source who asked not to be named said Bratsk produced 62,800 tonnes of primary aluminium in October after 61,500 tonnes in September and 64,500 tonnes in August.
Bratsk's costs, already some of the lowest among Russian aluminium producers, are an average $1,250 per tonne of aluminium produced and transported to Rotterdam via St Petersburg, said Boris Arlyuk of the Alumconsult consultancy.
""Their production is pretty profitable,"" he said.
But Shlaifshtein said Bratsk was seeking to streamline costs even further and that a new, tough attitude to debtors by Russian tax officials could put flagging competitors in the European part of Russia out of business.
""Each factory should improve its economic situation and cost factors in order to be competitive on the market,"" he said.
Bratsk does not like to talk about a recently-ended global output-cutting deal which required Russian producers to cut back production to boost sagging world prices.
World prices are again flagging --- but Shlaifshtein said that this time, cutting output was not an option.
""The volume of output at the plant should change only on the basis of one's own strategic interests, of the overall economic situation and of the market situtaion,"" Shlaifshtein said.
He said it made economic sense for the plant to use its capacity, but gave no further details.
Bratsk, Russia's flagship aluminium smelter, wants to top its Soviet-era record output of 857,000 tonnes a year after 772,500 tonnes in 1995.
Its total capacity is at least 820,000 tonnes and possibly one million tonnes, according to Western industry sources.
Bratsk had already closed a unit for technological and environmental reasons by the time Russia, Canada, Australia, Norway, the United States and the European Union signed a two-year global output-cutting memorandum of understanding in March 1994. The deal expired this spring.
Bratsk produces most of its metal under tolling arrangements with London-based shareholder Trans-World Group, which has at least a 50 percent stake in the plant. --Moscow Newsroom, +7095 941 8520

1050,"China announced on Saturday a massive restructuring of one of its biggest conglomerates after reportedly meting out a suspended death sentence to the son of the former company chairman, one of the country's ruling elite.
State media announced the restructuring of Capital Iron, or Shougang, on Saturday but made no mention of the suspended death sentence handed down to Zhou Beifang, the former head of two of the steel giant's Hong Kong-listed affiliates.
A Beijing court gave Zhou the suspended death sentence for corruption as part of China's highly-publicised anti-graft campaign launched last year, a Chinese source said on Saturday.
The sentence was the heaviest handed down in recent years to one of China's so-called ""princelings"", the popular sobriquet applied to the children of the ruling party elite, who enjoy wide influence.
Shougang, one of China's biggest conglomerates, was thrust into the limelight after Zhou's detention in February 1995.
The arrest of a man symbolising Beijing's efforts to wield capitalist influence while retaining a socialist veneer underlined the vulnerability of that system to nepotism and abuse.
Zhou Beifang's father, Zhou Guanwu, 78, resigned as chairman and Communist Party secretary of Shougang in February 1995, citing old age following his son's detention.
The Zhous have close ties to the family of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.
Last month, prosecutors filed charges of corruption against 30 people, including Zhou Beifang and two former officials of the Beijing city government. No other details of the case were available.
Chinese courts frequently impose the death penalty in major corruption cases. Suspended death sentences are often commuted to life imprisonment after two years.
Court officials could not be reached for comment on the sentencing.
The China Daily said the restructuring of Shougang draws a clear line between the property rights, responsibility and management of the parent company and subsidiary.
In the past, a large percentage of the parent company's profits went to branch companies, many of which are running in the red, the newspaper said.
Shougang's parent company would gradually cut off financial subsidies to subsidiaries which would be forced to sink or swim in the market economy as part of the restructuring programme.
""We will provide financial support for our subsidiaries for a few years, helping them in investment, finance and discharge of their debts based on an appraisal of their fixed assets,"" Bi Qun, Communist Party secretary of Shougang, told the newspaper.
""Once that is done the subsidiary companies will develop strategies to stop losing money and begin to make profits,"" Bi was quoted as saying.
The number of employees of the parent company would be gradually slashed to 58,000, or one-fourth of the group's total, the Xinhua news agency said. It gave no timetable.
The group's 27 subsidiaries would employ 176,000 people.
The group registered 1.653 billion yuan ($199 million) in pre-tax profits in the first 10 months of 1996, Xinhua said. It gave no comparative figures.
Corruption was virtually eliminated in the years after the communists came to power in 1949, but has staged a comeback along with economic reforms in the past 17 years.
Communist Party chief and state president Jiang Zemin has declared war on corruption, warning that the scourge was a virus that threatened the party.

1051,"China has vowed to curb the influence of Buddhism in Tibet, saying religion would have to bow to socialism.
Monks outnumbered students and more money was spent on monasteries than on Communist Party buildings in the Himalayan region, the official Tibet Daily said in an edition seen in Beijing on Wednesday.
""In the basic interest of the Tibetan people, further development of temples, monks and nuns cannot be without restrictions,"" the newspaper said.
""Satisfying the basic needs of believers will do.""
There were 1,787 temples in the restive region by early 1996, with 46,000 monks and nuns -- exceeding the number of high school students in the region, the newspaper said. It gave no comparative figures.
China has shut many temples in Tibet in recent years to uproot the influence of the region's spiritual god-king, the Dalai Lama, who fled into exile in India in 1959 after an abortive uprising against communist rule.
Socialism must take precedence over religion, the newspaper said.
""Religion must adapt to the development needs of socialism and not socialism adapting to the needs of religion. We must remain clear-headed on this principle,"" it said.
The Dalai Lama won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his non-violent campaign for autonomy for his homeland, but Beijing views international support for Tibet's holiest man as a Western plot to return the region to feudal rule and split China.
Beijing says the Dalai Lama is a political activist and not a purely religious figure.
""International anti-Chinese forces use the Tibet issue to contain China's development and (the Tibet issue) is an important means to 'Westernise' and 'divide' China,"" the newspaper said.
""Some temples are directly or indirectly controlled by the Dalai Lama clique and become the headquarters and venue of separatist forces at home and abroad,"" the newspaper said.
""Since 1987, elements creating disturbances and sabotaging stability have been mainly law-breaking monks and nuns.""
Tibet has been rocked by repeated anti-Chinese protests that Beijing charges are stirred up by supporters of the Dalai Lama.
The newspaper also complained that monks did not contribute to economic growth.
""It goes without saying that such a large number of strong young people relying on alms from the masses and not engaging in productive work has a negative effect on social and economic development,"" the newspaper said.
""Money spent on renovating temples is more than money spent on building or repairing Communist Party and government buildings,"" it said.
Beijing, eager not to antagonise all of the Buddhist clergy, has pumped 53 million yuan ($6.4 million) into its five-year renovation of the sprawling Potala Palace, winter home of the Dalai Lamas for centuries.

1058,"China announced on Thursday that a court had rejected the appeal by a son of one of the country's politically powerful families, upholding a suspended death sentence for bribery.
The court showed leniency to Zhou Beifang, 43, former chairman of Hong Kong-listed affiliates of the giant state-owned Capital Iron and Steel Corp (Shougang), because he showed remorse, the official Xinhua news agency said.
Zhou's death sentence was suspended for two years. Such suspensions usually mean the sentence will not be carried out if the prisoner repents and cooperates with authorities.
Zhou is one of China's so-called ""princelings"", or children of the ruling party elite, who enjoy wide influence due to their top level connections.
The Zhou family has close ties to the family of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.
The court also showed leniency because Zhou voluntarily returned ill-gotten wealth even before prosecutors obtained evidence against him, Xinhua said.
Zhou was convicted of accepting bribes totalling 9.28 million Hong Kong dollars ($1.2 million) between June 1993 and April 1994, Xinhua said. It gave no details of who paid Zhou the bribes or why.
He was also found guilty of paying 1.2 million yuan ($144,600) in bribes to three people, including two former officials of the Beijing city government, so that his wife and daughter could move to the British colony, it said.
Xinhua quoted the Supreme Court as announcing the decision though it was the appeals court that handed down the verdict.
The agency gave no explanation. It did not say when Zhou was convicted, when he appealed or why his appeal was turned down.
Court officials reached by telephone declined comment.
State television showed a grim Zhou wearing a stylish, striped blue shirt and examining documents held by a court policeman as a court tribunal looked on.
Zhou's conviction was part of a highly-publicised anti-graft campaign launched by China last year. It led to the suicide of a Beijing vice-mayor in April 1995 and the fall of his mentor, former Beijing Communist Party boss Chen Xitong.
Zhou's father, Zhou Guanwu, 78, resigned as chairman and Communist Party secretary of Shougang in February 1995, citing old age. He stepped down days after his son's detention.
The court also rejected the appeal of co-defendant Chen Jian, 39, former deputy director of the General Office of the Communist Party's Beijing Municipal Committee. It upheld his 15-year prison sentence for accepting bribes from Zhou, Xinhua said.
Another former official of the Beijing city government, Li Min, did not appeal against his sentence of life imprisonment, also for accepting bribes from Zhou, the agency said.
In a related case, the court rejected the appeal of businessman He Shiping, who was sentenced to 16 years for accepting bribes. A fifth defendant, who was given five years in prison, did not appeal, it said.
Television showed lengthy footage that include Li staring at the floor and a dejected He Shiping wiping tears from his eyes.
Corruption was virtually eliminated in the years after the communists came to power in 1949. But it has staged a comeback since economic reforms were introduced 17 years ago as living standards climb but at the cost of eroding party discipline.

1059,"Chinese activists, in a statement on Tuesday hours ahead of a visit by the U.S. Secretary of State, protested against American backing for Japan's bid to become a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council.
""We hold that Japan is not qualified to become a permanent member of the Security Council of the United Nations,"" the activists said in a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who is due to arrive in Beijing later on Tuesday for a three-day visit.
The letter, signed by 15 activists, said they opposed Japan becoming a permanent member of the Security Council because many Japanese politicians had been reluctant to apologise for its war atrocities and had tried to whitewash history.
China says more than 35 million people were killed or wounded during Japan's invasion and occupation of most of China from the early 1930s to 1945.
""(We) strongly protest the U.S. government supporting Japan's (bid) to become a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council to draw Japan over to its side,"" said the letter, a copy of which was made available to Reuters.
Tong Zeng, a leader of the group, said he would forward the letter to Christopher through the U.S. embassy in Beijing.
The Chinese government, eager for more low-interest loans from Japan, has been reluctant to antagonise Tokyo and has not taken a public stance on the issue.
The United States has long supported giving Japan and Germany permanent seats on the Security Council.
The council currently consists of five permanent members that were the main victors in World War Two -- the United States, Russia, Britain, China and France -- and 10 non-permanent members who serve two-year terms.
Most Chinese have been slow to forgive Japan's war past.
""U.S. backing for Japan's (bid)...will undoubtedly encourage the resurrection of Japanese militarism and bring a new threat to the peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region,"" the letter said.
The anti-Japanese activists recounted what they said were U.S. mistakes, including not putting Emperor Hirohito on trial after the end of World War Two in 1945.
""After the end of the war, the United States harmed the feelings of the Chinese people several times...sheltering Japan's top war criminal Emperor Hirohito,"" the letter said. Hirohito died in 1989.
The activists also faulted the United States for ""ignoring historical facts"" and handing disputed islands in the East China Sea to Japan in 1971.
Sino-Japanese ties were strained this year over the islands, which Beijing calls the Diaoyus and Tokyo the Senkakus.
A Japanese right-wing group built a makeshift lighthouse on one of the islands in July, triggering anti-Japanese demonstrations in Hong Kong and Taiwan.
Taiwan's Nationalist rulers, who lost the Chinese civil war to the Communists in 1949, also claim the islands. Activists in the British colony of Hong Kong, which reverts to Chinese rule in 1997, have opposed Japan's territorial claims.
Emotions were fanned in September when a Hong Kong activist drowned after he jumped into stormy waters around the islands to demonstrate support for Chinese claims.

1094,"The mother of detained Chinese dissident Wang Dan said on Monday she would defend her son against the capital charge of plotting to overthrow the government and that he was prepared for a heavy sentence.
""Two defence counsels are allowed...I will be one of them,"" Wang Lingyun, a 61-year-old researcher at a museum who has no background in law, told Reuters in an interview.
""Wang Dan also wants me to defend him,"" she said. Chinese laws allow accused to be defended by family members.
A court spokeswoman confirmed Wang Dan, 26, had been charged with plotting to overthrow the government but declined to give further details.
Wang Dan's mother said the court had yet to inform her of the trial date, but said it could come as early as this week.
The dissident, detained without charge since May 1995, met his mother for the first time under police surveillance at a detention centre in Beijing, the Hong Kong-based Information Centre of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.
""Wang Dan...was very calm and psychologically prepared for a heavy sentence,"" the group quoted the mother as saying. She added that she was worried about her son's health.
She told Reuters earlier that she would defend her son against the charge of collaborating with overseas subversive forces. ""This charge does not stand up,"" she said, adding that Wang Dan had only taken a correspondence course at the University of California, Berkeley, in the United States.
""It has nothing to do with politics. I was the one who wanted him to attend the course...It has nothing to do with overthrowing the government,"" she said.
Asked to comment on the chances of winning the case, she said: ""I'm not optimistic. But I must say it for the record. This will become history.""
Relatives said last week they had found a lawyer willing to defend Wang after being given one day to find one.
The lawyer retained by the family would defend the dissident against other charges in the indictment.
Wang Dan, former leader of the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations, has been charged with the capital offence of plotting to subvert the government, based on evidence such as writings critical of the state and accepting funds from abroad.
He was detained by police in a raid on his home in May 1995, but was not formally arrested or charged until last week.
On Friday, the family obtained a copy of the bill of indictment, which accused Wang Dan of plotting to subvert the government, a crime that carries a maximum penalty of death. The minimum sentence is 10 years, although the court can show leniency if it finds extenuating circumstances.
Wang has already served four years in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes, or subversion, for his role in the 1989 demonstrations centred in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, which were crushed by the army with heavy loss of life.
Wang had been expected to face new charges since last December, when the court that convicted veteran democracy activist Wei Jingsheng of plotting to overthrow the government also implicated the former student leader.
The court's verdict said Wei, who was jailed for 14 years, had links with people ""convicted of counter-revolutionary crimes, including Wang Dan"". It also referred to a tape-recorded conversation between Wang and Wei, but gave no details.
Wang had been active since his release from jail, defying persistent police surveillance and harassment to join in a daring appeal to communist leaders for the release of all those still in prison for their part in the 1989 protests.

1102,"Hong Kong shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa was rated by a poll on Thursday as the best man to deal with China as a Beijing-controlled committee grilled candidates vying to run the territory when Britain pulls out in 215 days.
Britain hands its colony back to Chinese sovereignty at the stroke of midnight next June 30, and the 400-strong Selection Committee is in the midst of a three-day vetting of Tung and two rivals bidding to succeed colonial Governor Chris Patten.
The winner will be announced on December 11.
The opinion poll, conducted among 967 people by the Chinese University of Hong Kong on Monday and Tuesday, showed Tung to be the favourite and indicated 73 percent of the respondents also believe Tung is the candidate who can communicate best with the Chinese government in Beijing.
Only 7.2 percent thought his rival, former chief judge Ti Liang Yang could commmunicate well with Beijing, while another candidate, businessman Peter Woo, scored only two percent.
Yang, however, was seen as being more impartial and as the man most ready to voice his opinion to China, the poll showed.
Asked who was most likely to speak out against Beijing, 31 percent said Yang, 20 percent Tung and 4.8 percent Woo.
After the first day's questioning of the candidates by the committee on Wednesday, Tung emerged as a better communicator than he has appeared on previous occasions, analysts said.
He produced a clearly focused vision for Hong Kong with the main thrust on putting business and economic interests first.
During the quizzing by committee members representing Hong Kong's business community, Tung blasted the Democratic Party, Hong Kong's largest, urging it to drop its anti-China stance and to play a positive role in the transition for the sake of Hong Kong's 6.3 million people.
""At present they are objecting to anything Chinese,"" Tung said. ""This is not good in the long term or for the interests of Hong Kong,"" he said. ""They should not think in this way.""
The Democrats are boycotting the Selection Committee, condemning its mission to pick Hong Kong's post-colonial leader as undemocratic and its activity to assemble a new provisional body to supplant the present elected legislature as a violation of handover pledges made by China.
Tung, delivering his policy platform in a speech to the body, outlined a new era in which he would pack his advisory cabinet with specialists and include legislators -- now excluded from the equivalent colonial body.
He also said he would like to retain all the senior local officials of the civil service in sign that he might keep on the present and highly regarded Chief Secretary Anson Chan.
Among his policy initiatives, Tung listed the revival of manufacturing industries, especially with a high-tech focus.
In recent years manufacturing has shifted out of Hong Kong to cheaper locations in mainland China, and Hong Kong has become a service-based economy.
Tung also said he wanted to boost the role of provident funds and social security. He said he would press for faster approval of construction plans, the sale of public housing to tenants at affordable prices, the release of more government land for housing, and a reduction of red tape.
He said he had a sense of mission to work for Hong Kong's good. ""My father C.Y. Tung had always taught me to do meaningful things and to be proud of being a Chinese,"" he said. ""It is this sense of mission that drives me.""

1106,"Britain has suggested going to the World Court over China's plan to disband Hong Kong's elected legislature when Beijing takes back the territory next July.
The spectre of the two countries slugging it out in the International Court of Justice in the Hague raised the drama of Hong Kong's transition to Chinese rule to a new level after many months of bitter wrangling on handover arrangements.
British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind and Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten denounced China's plans on Friday and proposed letting the World Court rule on the dispute.
After more than 150 years of British rule, the capitalist territory of 6.3 million people falls back under the Chinese flag at midnight next June 30, with promises from Beijing's communist leadership that almost nothing will change.
At that moment, a Beijing-appointed legislature will take over from the elected Legislative Council (Legco), reversing democratic reforms introduced by Patten over the past four years.
""There is no justification for China to replace a legislature elected openly and fairly by more than one million Hong Kong people,"" Rifkind said in London.
""China should be prepared to trust Hong Kong people with the measure of democracy we have introduced.""
He summoned Chinese ambassador Jiang Enzhu, the man tipped to be China's envoy in Hong Kong next July, to underline Britain's concern.
Separately, Patten said in a statement and in an interview with Reuters that the body planned by China would be a ""rubber stamp"" chamber that would simply echo Beijing.
The threat of World Court action came on the eve of a vote by 400 wealthy and influential Hong Kong people picked under China's supervision to elect the provisional legislature.
Pro-democracy groups staged scattered protests in Hong Kong and jeered committee members as they left for the Chinese frontier city of Shenzhen where Saturday's meeting takes place.
""The International Court of Justice will, I'm sure, be able to sort things out, and we'd be very happy to put our arguments to them,"" Patten told Reuters.
""Clearly this weekend is going to be a very disagreeable one,"" Patten said, adding that China might ""trash an institution"" but it could not ""stamp out the spirit of democracy"" in Hong Kong.
Protesters mounted small-scale demonstrations outside China's diplomatic mission in the colony and at the Hung Hom railway station where members of the Selection Committee were boarding trains for Shenzhen.
""It is totally unacceptable,"" said lawmaker Emily Lau, who joined in the protests. ""There is no legal and constitutional basis for that body, and also the Chinese government is using that body to kick out people who they do not like.""
Patten said that despite Britain's views on the legislature, he would meet Hong Kong's post-colonial leader-designate, 59-year-old shipping magnate Tung Chee-hwa, to explore ways to cooperate on building the post-handover administration.
The quarrel over the legislature set Tung and Patten on a collision course this week. Tung lashed back in a speech to the business community, saying Britain must ""face the reality"" and warned that if the legislature were challenged he would get China's parliament to pass a resolution making it legal.
Hong Kong's biggest pro-democracy group, the Democratic Party, is boycotting Saturday's selection process, which it brands as a plot to snuff out democracy and enact repressive laws.
""You won't find five of them who can be called democrats by any stretch of the imagination,"" Democratic Party leader Martin Lee told Reuters, commenting on the candidates.

1109,"On the eve of an historic gathering of the elite assembled by China to pick Hong Kong's future leader, the smart money was on Tung Chee-hwa.
Most observers viewed it as a foregone conclusion that the shipping tycoon would emerge the winner after the 400-strong Selection Committee of Hong Kong business titans and pro-China politicians meets on Wednesday to choose the territory's post-colonial chief executive.
Blessed by a personal public handshake from Chinese President Jiang Zemin last January, Tung ran off with 206 votes in the first round of voting last month by the committee, which was chosen under Beijing's close supervision.
Sovereignty over the territory of 6.3 million people, one of Asia's economic wonders and Britain's last major colony, reverts to China at midnight next June 30 -- 203 days from now.
A poll by Hong Kong's Lingnan College showed on Tuesday that 56 percent believed the winner has probably been picked in advance. Only 18 percent believe there will be a real contest.
""I don't think there was ever any doubt that it would be Mr Tung. I've been calling this selection committee the Tung Chee-hwa selection committee,"" said Martin Lee, head of the Democratic Party, the largest in Hong Kong's legislature.
Lee, whose party is boycotting the selection process, said Tung could not be counted on to preserve Hong Kong's freedoms, human rights and its current moves towards greater democracy.
""The people of Hong Kong cannot trust him to protect our rights, not because he is a bad man, he is a nice guy, but I cannot see how he is in a position to say no to Beijing on any important issue,"" Lee said.
Some Hong Kong newspapers were already putting the finishing touches on Tuesday to a slew of Tung-the-victor profiles for publication on Wednesday, an industry source said.
If he wins on Wednesday, Tung will be greeted soon by a no-confidence debate presented by lawmaker Emily Lau, one of China's loudest critics.
Colonial Governor Chris Patten has promised his support for the chief executive-designate, whoever it turns out to be, in the twilight months of British rule.
Tung has not responded to the pledge but has said he will engage Hong Kong's respected civil service in dialogue on how best to run the territory and ensure a smooth transition.
""Nobody wants the present administration to be turned into a lame duck,"" Tung said on Monday.
Two rival candidates -- former Chief Justice Ti Liang Yang and entrepreneur Peter Woo -- are both ranked as outsiders.
An opinion poll by Hong Kong University last week gave Tung 46.7 percent, Yang 28.8 percent and Woo 5.2 percent public backing.
But Tung only began to gain public support in the past month, after Patten's chief civil servant Anson Chan declared she would not run for the job. Tung has never matched the 60 percent-plus popularity ratings which Chan enjoyed.
Assuming he wins, the 59-year-old tycoon will spend the next six months assembling a cabinet of advisers to guide policy after Hong Kong becomes an autonomous Special Administrative Region of China. His team is expected to be highly pro-business, but he has also promised a role for grassoots bodies.
He will also lay the groundwork for a provisional legislature, soon to be picked by the same Selection Committee, to take over from the present elected Legco next July 1.
The leader-in-waiting will face many challenges before and after the handover, with Britain and China locked in disputes on issues ranging from passports, nationality and troop deployments to an anti-subversion law and the disbanding of Legco.

1112,"Britain risked China's wrath on Tuesday by proposing new laws on subversion in Hong Kong, laying down legal markers intended to head off Chinese-style jailings of dissidents after Beijing takes over the colony in 1997.
The colonial government unveiled draft amendments to Hong Kong's criminal law, ordered by Governor Chris Patten's cabinet, to cover crimes of subversion and secession. The bill will go to the Legislative Council next Wednesday.
Britain's move, after months of fruitless exchanges with China on the issue, was an effort to set down legal standards for China to follow after Beijing takes control of the territory at midnight next June 30, British officials said.
But the move was promptly attacked by Chinese officials. A spokesman for China's de facto embassy, the Xinhua News Agency office, was quoted by a local Beijing-controlled news agency as saying Britain had ""violated promises on the transition"" and London ""must bear all the consequences of its actions"".
Under a post-1997 Hong Kong constitution promulgated by China, the Basic Law, the territory must add laws against secession and subversion to the statute book after the handover.
Until now China has indicated it will have the law enacted by a new legislature it planned to install after the sovereignty transfer, sparking fears in Hong Kong that it will bring in draconian communist-style laws clamping down on dissent.
Mainland China has always eyed Hong Kong as a potential base of subversion, ever since revolutionaries used it as one of their bases against the imperial Manchu dynasty in the last century.
A Legislative Council motion in January urged the Hong Kong government to introduce pre-emptive laws on the issue to protect the civil rights of Hong Kong's 6.3 million people.
Fears were aggravated by remarks made by senior Chinese officials this year including Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Beijing's Hong Kong policy chief Lu Ping, who set clear limits on post-1997 freedom of expression in the territory.
Britain's draft bill proposes adding the crimes of secession and subversion to the existing criminal law and clarifies the definition of seditious activity. It removes references to the present sovereign Queen Elizabeth, and refers only to Britain.
""It would not be desirable to leave a legislative gap in this important and sensitive area,"" an official said.
""It is quite clear that it is the view of the community that we should seek to have legislation on these concepts in place before July 1, 1997,"" said Secretary for Security Peter Lai.
The changes take a form that makes them easily adaptable by the future government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) that China will install, an official said, adding that all that would have to be changed in the law after 1997 would be the name of the sovereign state from Britain to China.
Under the amended law, sedition would carry a maximum jail term of two years, subversion and secession 10 years, and treason life imprisonment. In China these crimes can earn a death sentence. In Hong Kong the death penalty is non-existent.
The draft law makes clear the offences are related to the use of force to attempt to overthrow the government, and not to non-violent criticism of the regime or of the political system as in China, officials said.
""What the British seem to be doing is to set down legal standards that would give space to non-violent critics and dissenters -- a law that wouldn't put people like Wei Jingsheng or Wang Dan in jail,"" a source close to the government said.
Wei, the father of the Chinese democracy movement, and former student leader Wang Dan, were both given lengthy jail terms in China this year for subversion.
Both dissidents had criticised the government orally and in their writings and had called for democratic change in China, but neither man had resorted to violence.

1126,"The skyscrapers are decked with fairy lights. Red-cloaked Santas pat children on the head. Christmas carols ring out. It is Christmas in Britain's last major colony, but will it ever be like this again?
The most spectacular Christmas light displays in the world are strung from Hong Kong's skyscrapers, featuring giant illuminated Santas and reindeer covering entire facades, beaming a rainbow of colours along the famed Hong Kong harbour skyline.
Hong Kong -- shopping paradise of the world -- is awash with Christmas. Its glass and marble malls brim with exorbitant festive displays, its shops push the fanciest, most expensive brand names in the world, specially repackaged for the season.
But after Britain pulls out and Communist-ruled china takes over next July, what then?
Will Christmas turkey, Christmas pudding and Christmas cake be allowed to grace the yuletide dinner table? Even if it does, will it taste the same?
Will revellers pull Christmas crackers and drink themselves silly in merriment as many do today?
Will China allow bourgeois extravagance and Western customs? Will charities run their ""Operation Santa Claus"" fundraising drive for the disadvantaged and underprivileged? Will Christians be free to worship at Midnight Mass?
If China lives up to its promises, the answer to all these questions is a resounding ""yes"".
China has promised to allow Hong Kong to retain its freewheeling capitalist system for a further 50 years, as a quasi-autonomous part of the motherland under a ""one country two systems"" policy. This means freedom of religion will stay. And the hybrid cocktail of customs and traditions, too.
However, many of Hong Kong 6.3 million people worried that pro-democracy protests such as a Christmas Eve vigil and the mass dispatch of Christmas cards to mainland dissidents by human rights groups on Tuesday might not be allowed again.
It is also doubtful if Queen Elizabeth's Christmas broadcast will ever again be on Hong Kong public radio and television.""
Christmas is still going to be a holiday next year in Hong Kong, as is the other main Christian festival, Easter.
Only the Queen's official birthday and World War Two victory holidays are to be removed after China takes over.
And, in this overwhelmingly ethnic Chinese territory, there are more non-Chinese than ever, despite the gradual departure of expatriate colonial civil servants and company executives.
There are 37,000 Americans, 33,000 British and 30,000 Canadians, enough to keep a few Christmas parties going. The largest foreign group, 140,000 Filipinos, mostly brought in as servants, are also a strong Christian community.
Nevertheless, there are misgivings how much will remain the same in Hong Kong. And there's a whiff of melancholy and pre-nostalgia among expatriates this festive season.
It's almost like a ""last supper"", their minds tilted towards midnight next June 30, 1997, the moment when the British flag will be furled away here forever.
Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's annual ""Christmas Song Choice"", which will be aired on local radio, reflects the mood.
His selection starts with Louis Armstrong singing ""Basin Street Blues"", followed by ""As Time Goes By"" by Jimmy Durante.
Patten gathered his family and friends on Wednesday night, Christmas night, for a traditional dinner of roast turkey.
All assembled were aware it could be the last Christmas dinner in the regal Government House overlooking the harbour.
Patten's successor Tung Chee-hwa, who will be Hong Kong's first Chinese leader, has indicated he doesn't want to live in the mansion that symbolises Hong Kong's one and a half centuries of British colonial rule and 150-plus years of China's national shame. He says the residence is cramped and inauspicious.
So no more Christmas there, at least.
Hong Kong's final year as a British colony has seen the balance of power tilt into China's orbit, even before the change of flag arrives. Chinese influence waxed and Britain's waned.
However, just as Christmas has become a commercial success in Japan, the festival will inevitably live on -- Chinese-style.
Hong Kong Chinese vie with each other to lavish expensive presents on their children.
Even over the border in mainland China, Christmas shopping sprees are catching on. There, Santa Claus has taken to riding a rickshaw, instead of a sleigh.

1132,"Canadian envoys on Tuesday dismissed reports that thousands of Hong Kong people in Canada may be forced to flock home en masse ahead of Hong Kong's 1997 handover to China in order to protect their residence rights.
Canada's commissioner in Hong Kong, Garrett Lambert, and the country's ambasador to China, Howard Balloch, said they believed China would soon decide on the issue, which has been a stumbling block in Sino-British talks on the territory.
But Lambert said Hong Kong people who had emigrated from the British colony might have to live in Hong Kong as Canadians in future and lose their local voting rights after it becomes a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China on July 1, 1997.
Lambert told reporters he had been informed by China's envoy in Hong Kong, Zhou Nan, that progress was being made by Chinese and British negotiators on the problem of right of abode.
The question is one of the major unresolved issues facing the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG), which meets this Wednesday.
""This is a good file. It's one on which progress is being made. Mr Zhou said he expected that we would have a decision announced in the JLG soon -- my guess is probably in early January,"" Lambert said.
""It now seems fairly obvious that you do not have to be physically present in Hong Kong to protect your interests if you are already a permanent resident of Hong Kong before the transition,"" he said.
However, Lambert said questions remained about political and working rights of Hong Kong emigrants who return to live in the territory after 1997.
Of all Western nations, Canada has one of the largest immigration relationships with Hong Kong.
Apart from some 500,000 Hong Kong people who have emigrated to Canada in recent years, some 30,000 Canadian citizens live in Hong Kong, many of them originally Hong Kong citizens.
Press reports in Hong Kong have quoted British officials warning of a chaotic mass return of Hong Kong emigrants if China insists on them being in Hong Kong in person on the July 1 handover day in order to keep their residence rights.
Chinese officials have said in the past that this would be their bottom line, but the JLG has reached no agreement on it.
Canada has delayed a decision on granting visa-free entry to holders of a new Hong Kong passport to be issued after the handover, pending guarantees from China on the repatriation of Chinese who enter Canada illegally.
Replying to a reporter on Tuesday, Lambert denied Canada had any grounds to believe the SAR passport had been compromised from a security viewpoint.
Balloch declined to confirm or deny that significant numbers of Chinese illegal immigrants had entered Canada using Hong Kong documents that were illegally issued or obtained.
The envoys also denied local press reports that Canada had received a comprehensive list of Chinese dissidents living in exile in Hong Kong, and that it planned to grant them refuge after 1997. They said some individual dissidents had come forward but declined to comment further.

1137,"The United States' top diplomat on Asia drew flak from leaders of Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp on Wednesday as he met key officials and politicians on the colony's 1997 return to China.
The U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord had separate meetings with local political parties and with China's top official in the British colony, Zhou Nan.
Lord was also set to meet colonial Governor Chris Patten and his deputy, Anson Chan, as well as the man tipped as Hong Kong's first post-colonial leader, shipping magnate Tung Chee-hwa.
Pro-democracy parties criticised Lord for planning to see only one of the three candidates in the China-controlled contest to select a post-colonial successor to Patten -- tycoon Tung.
""He has adopted the conventional wisdom that Tung will be chief executive and that the other two have no chance,"" said legislator Emily Lau of the pro-democracy group, Frontier.
Lau said she was not invited to meet Lord. The democracy camp has accused China of preordaining Tung as winner of the contest, which will culminate on December 11, and some critics say Lord's meeting with him is helping to pick the victor.
""What's the point in seeing the others when there's only one who will become the chief executive-designate of Hong Kong,"" one U.S. diplomat admitted to a reporter on Wednesday.
Lau said U.S. politicians no longer followed up remarks supporting human rights and democracy with action, and that they were now interested only in making money out of China.
""If they cared about human rights and democracy they should have cancelled Secretary of State Warren Christopher's recent visit to China, to send Beijing a strong signal,"" Lau said.
But Christopher went there -- just one week after China had jailed leading dissident Wang Dan, she said. The U.S. has said it hopes to see Hong Kong keep its freedoms after 1997, but has stopped short of condemning Chinese plans to crimp democracy.
Legislator Yeung Sum, vice-chairman of the Democratic Party, Hong Kong's largest, said his party had told Lord of its worries about the future of press freedom, the elected legislature and the undemocratic nature of the post-1997 leadership contest.
His party had told Lord that a Chinese plan to dissolve the elected Legislative Council next July 1 and install a new provisional legislature was illegal, Yeung told reporters.
""It's a step back as far as democracy is concerned,"" Yeung said, branding the provisional legislature move a breach of the Sino-British treaty covering the sovereignty transfer.
Lord said Washington would continue to take a keen interest in Hong Kong after the change of flag at midnight next June 30.
""I'm here essentially for two reasons. One, to underline the United States' strong interest in a smooth reversion of Hong Kong to Chinese rule, and secondly I'm here to listen, and I'm listening to a wide spectrum of views,"" Lord told reporters.
Lord was to hold a news conference on Thursday.
On Wednesday, he heard not only the views of the democrats but also politicians who oppose some of Britain's latest moves.
Before meeting Lord, the chairman of the Liberal Party, Allen Lee, said he would stress his opposition to the colonial government's decision last week to put forward a liberal new anti-subversion law without China's agreement.
""Mr Patten, knowing that the chief executive will be selected next week, gazetted last Friday a bill, without the agreement not only from the chief executive-designate, but also from the Chinese government,"" Lee said.
""I think this is totally irresponsible. He is playing politics, and he doesn't deserve to be the governor of Hong Kong,"" he said.

1149,"Hong Kong's post-1997 leadership campaign has begun in earnest with all the top candidates for the job as the territory's chief executive stating their positions on key issues in recent days.
The latest was Sir Ti Liang Yang, who on Monday made several policy statements including support for China's controversial plan to scrap the British colony's elected legislature.
With Britain's withdrawal and Hong Kong's reversion to Chinese rule 245 days away, would-be contenders to succeed Governor Chris Patten as the territory's top executive have sharpened their policy positions and revved up their campaigns.
""I think we have a real race in the sense that there is no chosen candidate in this contest,"" political expert Michael DeGolyer said on Tuesday.
DeGolyer, who heads a study on transition issues at a Hong Kong university, dismissed speculation that China had decided the outcome in advance and said rival Beijing factions were backing different Hong Kong personalities in the race.
""It's pretty clear they are backing different candidates in this contest,"" DeGolyer told a Hong Kong radio talk show.
The four main contenders among 31 nominees are Yang, shipping magnate Tung Chee-hwa, businessman Peter Woo and ex-appeals court judge Simon Li.
Yang, who resigned as the territory's chief justice last month to vie for the chief executive slot, broke with government policy when he ended his silence on China's plans for the legislature, describing them as legal and necessary.
China plans to dissolve Hong Kong's elected Legislative Council (Legco) -- reversing Patten's democratic reforms -- and install an appointed ""provisional legislature"". Britain and Hong Kong's democratic camp hotly oppose the plan.
""In my view the provisional legislature has a legal basis and there is a necessity to establish it,"" Yang told reporters.
He said without it, there was a risk of a legal vacuum arising during the transition to Chinese rule.
But Yang rejected the idea of the new assembly operating in tandem with Legco in the run-up to the handover.
He also said the enactment of new laws on subversion and treason, to reflect the change of sovereignty, should be left to a future permanent legislature to handle.
Despite the campaign atmosphere, the territory's new leader will not be democratically elected but chosen by the secretive, Beijing-appointed Selection Committee, a panel of 400 people from Hong Kong that will make the choice next month.
The Beijing-controlled Hong Kong daily Ta Kung Pao on Tuesday called the process ""a democratic election with Hong Kong characteristics"", a play on China's label for its own political system, ""socialism with Chinese characteristics"".
Yang also said he was shedding his British knighthood and the corresponding title ""Sir"".
Over the past week all four front-runners have made clear they would not challenge China's tough line on key political issues such as the legislature, democracy, human rights and freedom of expression in Hong Kong.

1157,"Australia's information technology and telecommunication industry (IT&amp;T) on Tuesday welcomed a decision by Asia-Pacific leaders that would lead to a substantial reduction in tariffs.
""It is certainly welcome, as the telecommunications area has some very strong barriers in many markets,"" said Fleur Bayley, export manager of the Australian Informational Industry Association (AIIA).  
Bayley told Reuters that Australia has no trade barriers on IT&amp;T equipment, whereas local companies have to compete in markets that have high tariff barriers.
The meeting in the Philippines of 18 leaders of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) economies endorsed a United States plan to free the annual US$500 billion global trade in computers, memory chips and telecommunications equipment.
However, most IT&amp;T observers wanted more details about the tariff plan before they could assess its implications for the Australian sector.  
One computer industry analyst said the APEC plan is likely to benefit Australian IT&amp;T exports, but is unlikely to stimulate growth of technology imports into Australia.
""One would have thought with the relative maturity of our market that exports could increase faster than imports,"" the analyst said.
He said there could be a mild boost in demand from home users of computers, but it is unlikely to affect the demand in the corporate market.  
But another analyst said most of Australia IT&amp;T exports are from multinational corporations with operations in Australia and these companies are the ones that are most likely to benefit.
Australia exported more than A$2.5 billion in IT&amp;T goods in the 12 months to September this year but imported around A$9.6 billion worth of IT&amp;T goods over the same period.
U.S. computer giant International Business Machines Corp lBM exports about A$500 million of its computers from Australia to Asia, making it the country's single largest technology exporter.  
French telecommunictaions equipment maker Alcatel Alsthom is another multinational with large export volumes from Australia.
AIIA's Bayley said the association has a target of A$10 billion in IT&amp;T exports by the year 2000.
A decade ago, Australia's IT&amp;T exports were negligible.

1164,"Australian oil and gas companies are being snapped up by foreign companies with an eye for undervalued stocks, but analysts say the sector faces a bright future with higher oil prices and a deregulated gas market.
During 1996, there has been about A$2.5 billion (US$1.98 billion) worth of takeovers announced in Australia's shrinking oil and gas sector and another A$600 million worth of asset sales as some non-oil and gas players quit the local market.
Local oil groups with low share prices and overseas assets have struck the eye of hungry foreign companies, analysts said.
""Overseas people appreciate the value of oil and gas assets, particularly in southeast Asia, but I don't think the market is fully valuing these assets through the share prices,"" Timothy Savage, an oil and gas analyst at Hartley Poynton, told Reuters.
The A$1.78 billion tilt by U.S. oil giant Mobil Corp for Sydney-based Ampolex Ltd in February was the largest bid made this year in the sector, while British oil producers are also showing an active interest in Australian oil firms.
Brisbane-based Crusader Ltd was taken over mid-year by Clyde Petroleum Plc of the UK, while in the past month Premier Oil Plc has made a bid for Discovery Petroleum NL and Cairn Energy Plc has made a offer for Command Petroleum Ltd.
Most of the Australian oil groups that have attracted predator attention have been producers with oil assets offshore, said Stuart Baker, an oil and gas analyst with BT Securities.
""It is no coincidence at all that the companies that have disappeared have been always companies that have endeavoured to build an overseas presence, and they have all without exception been taken over,"" Baker told Reuters.
However the rise in the oil price this year had not been a reason for the corporate activity, analysts said. The main oil futures contract traded in New York has risen almost 50 percent over the past five months to about US$25.50 a barrel.
""Takeovers have been a feature of this sector for years and it doesn't seem to matter if the oil price is up or down,"" Baker said.
Baker said oil companies making the bids have a double positive effect from the oil price rise with increased cash flow and a boost in share prices making it easier for companies to raise equity and debt.
Remaining potential targets in the local oil and gas sector were medium sized groups like Cultus Petroleum Ltd and Petroz NL which have assets in the prospective Timor Sea area.
The sector's largest listed companies, Woodside Petroleum Ltd and Santos Ltd, were unlikely bid targets, analysts said. Woodside, which accounts for nearly 50 percent of the A$12 billion sector, is controlled by Anglo-Dutch oil giant Royal Dutch/Shell Group.
Santos is seen to have a restrictive share ownership structure making it difficult for takeovers, analysts said.
Santos has also been keen on purchases, buying A$250 million worth of oil assets this year from groups quitting the sector.
Takeover activity has raised the focus on the sector, particularly in gas exploration and development, analysts said.
They said reforms in the local gas industry has opened up opportunities for gas supplies to major mines in remote areas and the set up of co-generation projects around the country.
""There is a lot of money coming over here and finding their way into all sorts of corners of the industry. So it looks like it is going to be a fairly buoyant period again, irrespective of whether we have further takeovers ahead,"" Baker said.

1167,"Australia's largest listed aluminium producer Comalco Ltd reported on Monday a 72 percent slide in net profit for the first half of 1996, due to a weaker metal price and a stronger Australian dollar.
The lower than expected result saw metal analysts trim back their 1996 full-year profit estimates for Comalco, while investors wiped over five percent off the miner's share price.
Comalco, 67 percent owned by the world's largest mining group CRA Ltd/RTZ Corp Plc, reported a net profit of A$43.9 million (US$34.7 million) for the six months to June 30, 1996, down from A$155.1 million a year earlier.
""Lower primary aluminium prices, movements in the exchange rate, softer alumina markets and weaker alumina spot prices affected profit,"" Comalco chief executive Terry Palmer said in a statement.
The three-month aluminium contract traded on the London Metal Exchange has fallen nearly 13 percent to its current level of US$1,479.0 from the start of the year, while the Australian dollar has risen seven percent to around US$0.7900.  
Comalco's sales fell 31.6 percent to A$806.9 million for the half, due mainly to lower metal prices. The tough market conditions would continue into the second half, Palmer said.
""I think we are already a third of the way through the second half and I think we have got to expect it to be tough because even if the prices (of aluminium) improve next month it would be hard to get much gain out of it,"" Palmer told Reuters.
Shareholders are likely to be disappointed with the result, as the Melbourne-based miner slashed its dividend to three cents a share for the first half, from 12 cents a year ago. This was well below expectations of five to six cents a share dividend.
""It is a lot lower than what people were expecting,"" Macquarie Equities metals analyst Peter O'Connor told Reuters.
Investors reacted to the weak result by slicing five percent or 33 cents off Comalco's share price. The stock closed at A$7.10 on Monday, its lowest level since August 1.
Australian aluminium analysts said they would further cut their 1996 full-year profit forecast for Comalco, which produces about 17 percent of the nation's primary aluminium, 10 percent of the country's alumina and 21 percent of its bauxite.  
At the start of 1996, analysts forecast Comalco to report a net profit of between A$255 million and A$265 million for 1996, compared with the 1995 profit of A$232.3 million.
Lower metal prices and a stronger Australian dollar saw analysts trim their full-year forecast to around A$130 million prior to the half-year result.
But in light of Monday's six-month result, analysts further lowered their forecast to around A$90 million for the 1996 year.
""You would have to expect that numbers would be coming down to at least double of what the first half was,"" O'Connor said.

1169,"Canadian gold giant Placer Dome Inc on Tuesday agreed to a deal with Papua New Guinean (PNG) miner Highlands Gold Ltd that gives Placer control of the vast PNG Porgera gold mine and ends a bitter feud between the two miners.
The deal also keeps the Highlands group as a listed company free to develop base metal and gold projects in the resource rich South Pacific nation.
Under the complex plan the Vancouver-based miner would pay Highlands A$316.1 million (US$249.7 million) to buy Highlands' 25 percent stake in the Porgera mine, which is estimated to have produced 850,000 ounces of gold in calendar 1996.
Placer had previously offered Highlands A$276.8 million for its Porgera stake after building up a 40-percent stake in Highlands through a hostile takeover bid.
""We are pleased that Placer has accepted our offer,"" Highlands managing director Ian Goddard said in a statement.
The restructuring plan involves all shares in Highlands other than those held by Placer being cancelled and holders receiving a capital return of 65 cents cash per share and one share in Highlands Pacific.
""It's good for Placer Dome because it gets what it really wanted, it's good for Highlands shareholders because they get more than 75 cents, they get 65 cents cash plus they have the share in the new company,"" one source close to the deal said.
Highlands will spin-off a new company, Highlands Pacific Ltd, which would hold the Ramu nickel/cobalt and Frieda-Nena copper/gold projects as well as its exploration porfolio in PNG and Indonesia.
""There has been strong institutional interest in our proposal, which unlocks the value of Ramu, Frieda-Nena and Highlands' extensive exploration interests,"" Goddard said.
Under the restructure of the Highlands group about A$160 million would be raised through a mixture of new equity and the planned sale by Placer Dome of the shareholding it would inherit in Highlands Pacific.
The new equity issue in Highlands Pacific would be at 30 cents per share, Highlands Gold said. The newly-formed company would have a market capitalisation of about A$250 million when it lists on the Australian Stock Exchange in March.
Placer Dome already has effective control over the 25 percent stake in Porgera through its Australian offshoot Placer Pacific Ltd, which the Canadian miner plans to buy-out the remaining 24.6 percent stake in the Australian miner.
Placer Dome's orginal bid of 75 cents per Highlands share launched on November 28, 1996 was rejected by the PNG miner, which valued Highlands at A$423 million. Highlands had also threaten Placer with court action over its initial bid.
Investors welcomed the new deal.
In early afternoon trade Highlands shares were two cents up at 81 cents on active trade of about 14 million. While fellow Porgera partner Orogen Minerals Ltd touched a record high of A$3.05 on the news. Orogen holds 15 percent of Porgera.

""The whole Tenneco story is yet to unfold,"" Bleasel told Reuters in a telephone interview.
""There are a lot of rumours in the market that El Paso may not want to hold onto all of the assets,"" he said.
Bleasel said said AGL, a Australian gas utility and energy group, would wait and see what unfolds with the Tenneco-El Paso restructure, whether assets are sold off or not.
Tenneco's Australian assets include the 1700 km of pipeline in South Australia including the state's primary gas pipeline from Moomba to the Adelaide pipeline system. Tenneco is also building a 760 km gas pipeline in southwest Queensland.  
""I continuously say ... that AGL is interested in every sale whereever it is in the country because we are now a broad based energy company and if the Tenneco assets were to go to the market then we would be interested in how they were going to be presented to the market,"" Bleasel said.
""The silly thing to say is 'no we are not interested or no there is no possible sale,' then if somebody wants to do a little slick sale then they are not going to come and talk to you because you have said publicly you are not interested.""  
However, a Tenneco Australia spokeswoman said Tenneco had made no decision about the future of its Australian assets nor had it told anyone the assets were for sale.

He said 20-year agreement would not affect the company bottom line until the project is up and running in about two years time.

But analysts said Murdoch's forecast last month at News Corp's annual meeting that the group would achieve a profit lift of 20 percent for the year to June 30, 1997 was still possible.  
News Corp reported net profits of A$283 million for the three months ended September 30, down from A$308 million a year earlier. News said the weaker profit was a result of poorer returns in U.S. TV, Australian newspapers and book publishing.
Analysts had forecast net profit before abnormal items would be around A$320-330 million, up around 15 percent.
Net profit before abnormals came in at A$285 million.
""This is not as people were expecting type of result. It was a very flat result,"" one Sydney-based media analyst said.  
News Corp could still report a 20 percent rise in net profits for the 1996/97 year as it was only the U.S. television business that was below forecast, the analyst said.
The analyst said he would likely cut his full year forecasts for News Corp from the current A$1.545 billion (excluding abnormals and before preference dividends). ""I can see myself shaving that back to about the A$1,500 (million) mark,"" he said.
However, asked if News Corp could meet Murdoch's forecasts, the analyst replied: ""I think so, because the rest of the result was perfectly in line with what we were going for, so they will have to work hard and if things go right for them they can.""  
News Corp said its profit was mainly bolstered by the worldwide box office success of the science fiction movie Independence Day and its British newspapers and book publishing. Independence Day has grossed more than US$670 million worldwide, making it the third highest-grossing film in box office history.
British newspaper operations enjoyed strong growth with an 18-percent gain in operating profits in the three months to September, News Corp said. The Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times newspapers all posted gains in both advertising and circulation revenues in the first quarter.  
""Additionally, the group has benefitted from reduced newsprint costs,"" the company said.
""Offsetting these gains were weaker results in U.S. television, Australian newspapers and book publishing, which lacked results from the educational division which was sold in March 1996,"" it said.
News also said continued losses for its Asian satellite broadcaster, STAR TV, were in line with expectations.
At 1.40 p.m. (0240 GMT), News Corp shares were 16 cents or 2.24 percent lower at A$6.97 with just over 2.30 million shares traded, wiping over A$300 million off its market capitalisation.  
""It seems it's just a knee-jerk reaction to the first quarter, which looks like it was A$40 million below what the market was looking for,"" a Sydney broker said.
The analyst said the fall in Australian dollar terms also reflected the stronger local currency against the U.S. dollar as about 75 percent of News Corp's revenue is in U.S. dollars.
In U.S. dollar terms, News Corp operating income was seven percent higher in the first quarter.
The film, television, publishing and newspaper conglomerate reported a six percent fall in pre-abnormals net profit to A$1.26 million for the year to June 30, 1996.

1181,"Australia's biggest gambler Kerry Packer, a patron of Las Vegas casinos, on Monday raised his stakes in the local burgeoning casino industry with the acquisition of management control at Sydney Harbour Casino.
Packer's media group Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd said it would spend A$340 million on a 10 percent stake in Sydney Harbour Casino Holdings Ltd (SHC) and 85 percent of the management contract of the casino from U.S. casino operator Showboat Inc.  
PBL's investment both in the management contract and the shares of SHC would show very attractive financial returns over time, PBL chairman Brian Powers said in a statement.
""This transaction represents a major move into the gaming industry for PBL and provides us with an ideal base from which to build a substantial business in this dynamic industry,"" Powers said.
""This advances our strategic goal of building a third core business alongside our television and publishing businesses,"" he said. PBL also has a option over part of Showboat's remaining 16.1 percent stake in SHC.  
Showboat president and chief executive officer Kell Houssels said in the statement the transaction provided an opportunity to realise a superior return on its investment, while maintaining a major ownership position in the Sydney casino.
Packer, Australia's richest man, has sought control of the Sydney casino for the past three years. In 1994 Packer led a consortium to bid for the 12-year Sydney casino licence, but lost out to the Showboat led consortium in December 1994.
Since losing the Sydney casino license bid, Packer interests have launched several legal actions against Showboat for the award of the licence by the New South Wales (NSW) government.  
Packer's punt on SHC shares have already made him a profit as shares in both the casino owner and PBL rose strongly after the deal was announced before Monday's sharemarket open.

The deal was good for both companies as Packer's influence was likely to yield a tax-concession for the casino on the high-roller market, which is seen boosting cash flow for both the casino and PBL, Australian market analysts said.  
SHC owns the only legal casino in Sydney and has battled the New South Wales state government for the past 16 months to get a similar tax rate to other Australian casinos.
""I think Packer will probably get the tax-break from the government,"" one Sydney-based casino analyst said. ""I expect there will be some tax-break announcement this month,"" he said.
The Sydney casino is seeking a 10 percent tax concession from the state government on big spending gamblers, mainly from Asia, compared with the present tax rate of 27 percent.  
PBL is also expected to end the disappointing run of operating results the casino has reported since it opened a temporary casino in September 1995. The casino is expected to open a A$1.0 billion permanment casino later this year.
Packer also has a 10 percent stake in Melbourne casino operator Crown Ltd and about 20 percent of Hudson Conway Ltd, which in turn owns 37 percent of Crown.
""Given the Packer-Hudson Conway type of relationship it looks like there is a bit more to come out of this one,"" said Richard Wolf, a casino analyst at Bell Securities.

1182,"Canadian gold giant Placer Dome Inc's takeover bids for its Australian offshoot Placer Pacific Ltd and Papua New Guinea gold miner Highlands Gold Ltd are likely to be successful, analysts said on Thursday. A takeover of the two miners would give Placer Dome control of the big Porgera gold mine in Papua New Guinea (PNG).
""I think they will walk it in,"" said David Kauler, gold mining analyst at ANZ Securities.
Placer Dome had amassed a 33 percent stake in Highlands in the 24 hours before launching a 75 cents a share bid.  
The Vancouver-based miner is offering one of its shares for every 15 Placer Pacific shares. Placer Dome said its offer for Highlands represented a 36 percent premium to the price of the the shares on November 26. The offer for the 24.6 percent Placer Dome does not own in Placer Pacific represents aa 50 percent premium on the November 26 price, the Canadian miner said.
The shares of both Placer Pacific and Highlands soared after Placer Dome unveiled its offers before the market opening.
At 12.50 p.m. (0150 GMT) Placer shares were 47 cents or 32.87 percent higher at A$1.90 while Highlands shares were 16 cents or 27.59 percent higher at 74 cents.  
Australian gold analysts said they did not expect Placer Dome to raise its bid prices, with both Placer Pacific and Highlands directors likely to recommend shareholders to accept the offers in the absence of any higher bids.
""At the moment, the advice would be not to sell,"" Highlands company secretary Phillip West told Reuters. ""But the directors are considering the offer and are expected to make a statement later today,"" West said.
Analysts said the speed at which Placer Dome picked up a third of Highlands indicated there were plenty of sellers of the stock at these levels.  
Highlands has been in play since MIM Holdings Ltd put its 65 percent stake up for sale at 65 cents a share in April, but underwriter to the offer ANZ Securities, was left with 40 percent of Highlands, as investors neglected the offer.
""When you have someone offering 75 cents and not too long ago nobody was buying at 65 (cents) then its no wonder they are queuing up to sell,"" said Keith Goode at Bell Securities.
Analysts said Highlands needed a partner to help develop the Nena/Frieda River copper/gold project and the Ramu nickel-cobalt deposit, both in PNG. The two projects are estimated to cost US$1.5 billion to develop.  
""Highlands was really under pressure as its needed around A$500-A$600 million to finance its share of the Frieda and Ramu projects and that is pretty difficult for a company that is capitalised at A$350 million,"" ANZ's Kauler said.
Analysts said the offers are probably opportunistic, given that Placer Pacific and Highlands share prices were both earlier this year above Placer Dome's offer prices. But both have fallen with the gold price, which is currently around 2-1/2 year lows.
""It is opportune, with the gold price falling, but neither Placer (Pacific) or Highlands share prices have been going anywhere for most of this year,"" Kauler said.  
Gold analysts said Placer Dome was unlikely to mop up the remaining stake in Kidston Gold Mines Ltd, which is currently 75 percent owned by Placer Pacific.
""I don't expect there to be bid for Kidston, I think they will let that run its course,"" said one Sydney gold analyst.
The takeover bids for the Porgera partners, also boosted Goldfields Ltd share price, which owns 25 percent of the PNG mine and most of the gold sector despite a weaker gold price, which is currently trading at US$373/50 an ounce.
At 1.35 p.m. (0235 GMT), Goldfields shares were 24 cents or 9.76 percent higher at A$2.70. --Sydney newsroom 61-2 9373-1800

1193,"Westpac Banking Group, the second largest bank in Australia, announced plans on Wednesday to expand its Asian activities through an alliance with British-based Standard Chartered Bank Plc.
The move signals Westpac is ready to expand in the region again after putting most of its Asian activities up for sale 3-1/2 years ago to focus on Australasia.
At the time a recession was biting deeply into profits and the share register held potential predators such as Australia's richest man Kerry Packer and Lend Lease Corp Ltd.  
Westpac chief executive Bob Joss said in a statement the deal with Standard Chartered was of major importance.
""It is a good strategic fit for our future growth,"" he said. Standard Chartered group chief executive Malcolm Williamson said his bank was committed to ""ensuring this new relationship with Westpac is of significant long term benefit to both companies"".
The venture would focus primarily on Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia, before expanding into Vietnam and China in about six months, said David Morgan, group executive of Westpac Institutional and International Banking.

1194,"The international partners in Australia's largest gas project said on Thursday they plan to spend A$6.0 billion to double production, making it Australia's largest single resources investment.
Australian oil and gas producer Woodside Petroleum Ltd said the partners in the North West Shelf gas project offshore Western Australia plan to double production capacity to 14.5 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) a year.  
The decision by the North West Shelf partners was unlikely to boost the much-touted prospect of a co-operative development with the nearby Gorgon gas field, which has the capacity to produce six million tonnes of LNG a year, analysts said.
""The North West shelf partners have their own plans for expansion, but if the Gorgon partners have a good proposal that we can work together then we will certainly have a look at it,"" said Woodside's corporate affairs manager Geoff Wedgwood.
""But to date we have not seen a plan from them that fits within our plans,"" Wedgwood told Reuters.  
Last month an executive of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, a partner in both projects, raised hopes that the two projects could be developed together and questioned the expansion of the Shelf on a stand-alone basis.
Cor Herkstroter, chairman of Royal Dutch/Shell's committee of managing directors, then told Reuters in an interview that expansion of the North West Shelf could not be justified without integrating it with another project and that the development of both projects was a viable option.
Royal Dutch/Shell also owns 34 percent of Woodside.  
Woodside, the project operator, said the expansion plan was submitted to the project's eight Japanese power and gas utility customers at a meeting in Osaka this week.
""It is a significant step for the expansion of the North West Shelf project,"" Wedgwood said. The partners have spent A$12 billion on the project since it started in the early 1980s.
Woodside is an equal one-sixth shareholder in the project along with some of the world's major oil producers.
The Osaka meeting followed indications from buyers in June of their interest in an expansion of the project, said Woodside.  
However, work on the expansion would not start for another two years at least, Wedgwood said.
""The next thing that is likely to be a letter of intent in late 1997 for the development of this expansion proposal,"" Wedgwood said. He said between now and then there are lots of talks on technical issues surrounding the proposal.
""Following that would be a purchase agreement between the North West shelf partners and the Japanese buyers, which would be around late 1998,"" Wedgwood said.  
Only after this agreement would work start on the expansion. Besides Woodside and Shell, the other equal partners in the Shelf are The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd, The British Petroleum Co Plc, Chevron Inc and a partnership of Mitsui &amp; Co Ltd and Mitsubishi Corp.
Shell and Chevron are also partners in Gorgon along with U.S. oil giants Texaco Inc and Mobil Corp.

1200,"China will accelerate listings of new firms on its two stock markets next year to meet demand and curb speculation, a senior securities official said.
His remarks, published on Sunday, came a week after an official statement warned investors away from excessive speculation, triggering a steep sell-off on the Shanghai and southern Shenzhen stock exchanges.
However, an official of the top securities watchdog, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, sounded another note of caution, saying that the markets needed even tighter regulation because of insider trading, excessive speculation and trading on margin.
""It will remain at the top of our work agenda for a fairly long period of time to further supervise the stock market, and curb over-speculation and irregularities ... to better protect the interests of the smaller investors,"" Xinhua quoted the unidentified official as saying.
Since the People's Daily editorial one week ago, Shanghai's domestic A share index has tumbled 20.07 percent, standing at 922.34 points last Friday compared with 1,163.05 at the close a week before.
The foreign currency B index fell 3.84 percent to 63.743 points from 66.291 points a week ago after a roller-coaster five days of trading.
China would move more swiftly to list additional firms on the markets, in line with the recent market upswings, Xinhua quoted Zhang Dongsheng, a deputy director of the Finance and Banking Department of the State Planning Commission, as saying.
""This is part of the nation's effort to balance supply and demand in the stock market and curb excessive speculation,"" Zhang said.
Last week China announced a share quota of 10 billion yuan ($1.2 billion) for 1996 and to be carried over into 1997, almost double the 5.5 billion yuan approved for the previous year.
Analysts said one aim of the decision to flood the fledgling stock markets with new issues was to soak up excess funds that have fuelled a flurry of speculation in recent months.
At its height just a few days ago, Shanghai's domestic A share index had surged more than 100 percent and its Shenzhen counterpart over 300 percent since April, when Beijing announced that it supported development of the stock markets.
In a sign of soaring interest in securities, official figures show 21 million Chinese have now opened trading accounts, up from just 12 million at the start of the year and rocketing from 14 million in September, Xinhua said.
The rapidly growing number of stock investors had caused the market to overheat on a shortage of supply, resulting in runaway price rises and excessive speculation, Xinhua said.
""The current market size allows some institutional investors to manipulate the stock prices and drive them up to ridiculous highs,"" it quoted Cao Fengqi, a financial expert at prestigious Beijing University, as saying.
""An accelerated expansion of the Chinese stock market will boost the capital market and help pool more funds for capital-strapped enterprises,"" he said.
Speculation could be curbed only if the market was big enough to handle demand, he added.
Beijing, which says its stock exchanges and futures markets are experiments, was committed to the markets, Xinhua said.
Current market capitalisation of more than 1.33 trillion yuan, almost triple the 1995 figure, accounts for 18 percent of China's gross domestic product, compared with six percent at the end of last year, Xinhua added. ($1 = 8.3 yuan)

1204,"Are you a businessman looking for generous tax breaks, lengthy tax holidays, easy loans, clean air and spectacular scenery?
Then Tibet may be your answer -- that is, if you don't mind high transport costs, frequent power outages and temperamental telephone lines.
Beijing has given unparalleled privileges to try to attract foreign investors to this remote, rugged, restive and poverty-stricken region. Those policies are starting to pay off, albeit slowly, officials said.
""This year circumstances are rather improved as a result of our new policies to foreign investors,"" Wang Yaju, vice director of the Department of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation of the Tibet Autonomous Region, said in an interview.
He said the new, preferential policies unveiled last year had already paid off with 14 new foreign investment projects approved this year. That compared with the establishment of just 61 joint ventures between 1988 and 1995.
Wang said he was optimistic that a planned $48 million 50-50 venture between Taiwan's Kwang Yang Motors and Tibet's Summit Motor to produce motorcycle engines in neighbouring Sichuan province would be successful.
The plant would be registered in Tibet, pay taxes to that region and enjoy its tax breaks.
Most members of Tibet's tiny community of foreign investors seem attracted both by the tax holidays and the scenic beauty.
For example, John McKay of Santa Cruz, Calif., set up the Tibet Plateau Cashmere Co. with a U.S. company and a private Tibetan partner. The three-way partnership will process cashmere with the goal of producing finished knitwear.
The joint venture is exempt from income tax for the first five years after it makes a profit, and then pays only half the national rate of tax for the following five years.
Wading through the Chinese bureaucracy for the necessary permits was a frustrating and time-consuming process, McKay said, echoing the experiences of other investors in the region as well as throughout much of China.
Red tape appeared to be less entangling than in other regions, however.
Also, investors said they had considered the risks from possible anti-Chinese violence, but believed the profits outweighed potential losses.
""I don't think this (unrest) is very likely,"" said McKay.
""There's enough control here that it would cut off anything before it got started,"" said another businessman who declined to be identified. ""Tibetans are resigned to it and accept the way things are.""
Kesang Rigdol, a Nepali Tibetan who set up his Tibet Snowland Restaurant in the centre of Lhasa last year, did not dodge the difficulties of setting up a business in a land supposed to be the fabled Shangri-La.
Rigdol owns 63 percent and invested $40,000 in the restaurant, which many say is the best eatery in Lhasa, while his Tibetan partner, who provided the site, holds 37 percent.
""Everything we were able to do was because of the policy on joint ventures,"" he said.
Despite the long, bitter winter that keeps away most of the tourists who are his main customers, Rigdol is already considering setting up a second joint venture, a dairy farm.
""We can't get good quality milk and cream here,"" he said, adding that skilled labour was also a serious problem.
Rigdol employs Nepali cooks and had hoped to teach Tibetans culinary skills. ""But Tibetans don't seem to want to learn,"" he said. ""They are not interested at all.""
Foreign trade officials said they welcomed such small ventures, but were also eager to lure bigger investments, while recognising that the lack of a railroad, power shortages and limited flights hampered their bargaining power.
As part of a move to publicise opportunities in the vast, resource-rich but inaccessible region and escape their communications difficulties, Tibet authorities are preparing to launch a site on the Internet, the worldwide computer network.
Wang said investors in power plants, mineral resources and infrastructure were more than welcome.
Officials of the Tibet Department of Geology and Minerals said they were hoping the regional government would soon issue special regulations covering foreign investment in the region's underground resources.
Tibet wanted foreign firms to join forces in exploration for mineral resources, particularly copper, chromite, antimony and borax, said Wang Baosheng of the Department of Foreign Trade.
""This could lead to good opportunities for them to take part in exploitation of these resources,"" he said. ""This place has great potential, if you invest here you will have very good returns.""

1212,"China's long-delayed bid to enter the World Trade Organisation will fall under the spotlight when the world's richest nations meet to discuss its application this week, European and U.S. officials said on Monday.
Delegates of the Quad -- the United States, Japan, Canada and the European Union -- will meet for lunch on Tuesday on the sidelines of the first ministerial conference of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in Singapore, the officials said.
The European Union (EU) was trying to bring the United States on board regarding its proposal that China enter the world trade body through a phased accession process, one EU official said.
The United States says Beijing must comply with a ""road map"" to open its markets and eliminate trade and non-trade barriers before it can win U.S. support for its entry.
China had hoped to culminate its decade-long bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade by becoming a founding member of the WTO at its inception two years ago.
Its application foundered on opposition over entry terms, with Beijing maintaining that the price of the road map was too high. Talks continue at a snail's pace in Geneva.
One aim of Tuesday's Quad meeting would be to try to narrow differences between the United States and Europe over terms for China's entry, terms used by Beijing to play one side off against the other, one EU source said.
Outlining his key objectives for the week-long ministerial conference in Singapore, EU Commissioner for Trade Sir Leon Brittan, stressed the need to relaunch in earnest negotiations toward Chinese membership.
""We have the remarkable changes going on in China, as well as a continuing process of economic renewal elsewhere in Asia and in Latin America...Hence the urgent need for WTO enlargement,"" Brittan told the conference opening session.
Brittan has visited China several times in recent months and has said he received a warm response from Beijing to the phased accession proposal.
In his opening address to the conference, Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong also backed China's entry in a reference to pending memberships, although he repeated the United States stand that new applicants must meet the necessary criteria.
""Some of these new entrants are significant economic players, like China and Russia, their entry into the WTO would have a positive impact on the rules-based multilateral trading system,"" Goh said.
Senior Chinese analyst Pei Changhong said last week China was unlikely to concede on its demand to enter the WTO as a developing country and has the patience to hunker down for a long wait to win accession on its terms.
The United States insists that the size of China's economy ranks it as a developed country.
A goal of 1997 entry seemed an ambitious target given the distance between the United States and China on so many issues, but Pei said he hoped to see entry by 1999.
China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said last month that talks with the United States on entry could be wrapped up by mid-1997.

1216,"China has launched a manhunt across the restive region of Tibet, tightened airport security and offered a reward of $120,000 for the arrest of culprits who exploded a bomb in Lhasa last week, officials said on Monday.
The government had announced a reward of one million yuan ($120,000) for information leading to the arrest of those responsible for the bomb blast early on Christmas Day outside city government offices in the Tibetan capital, Lhasa, a senior official said.
""No one has yet been arrested and we are now mobilising and deploying our forces,"" Lhasa Vice Mayor Ou Yangxiang said in a telephone interview.
Notice of the reward had been published in the Lhasa Evening News on December 27 and it was being issued in other newspapers in the strategic Himalayan region, government officials said.
The Christmas Day bomb, the largest so far set off by anti-Chinese activists in restive Tibet, had resulted in no casualties but caused widespread damage, shattering windows within a radius of 100 metres (yards), officials said.
""Almost the whole of Lhasa heard it,"" said one Lhasa government official. ""It was a muffled sound, like -- whoong.""
Officials insisted there was little doubt that the blast was politically motivated and carried out by followers of the region's exiled god-king, the Dalai Lama.
The bomb exploded at night outside a government building and was therefore clearly political, said Zhou Kaifu, deputy director of the Tibet Public Security Bureau.
""This was done by the Dalai separatist camp,"" the government official said, adding that the attack bore the hallmarks of previous similar ""terrorist acts"". He declined to give details although several smaller bombings have been reported in Lhasa.
""This is a terrorist act, aimed at destroying peace in our area,"" he said. ""This was a brazen act.""
Police had set up a special task force to search for the culprits and customs and immigration officials had stepped up security searches at Tibet's airport, he said.
The senior police official said the bomb was a home-made device made mainly from ammonium nitrate, a fertiliser.
""We are targeting Tibetan exiles returning from abroad and who have political connections,"" he said when asked about the focus of the manhunt.
""The bomb was made at a farm,"" he said. ""We are searching mainly in Lhasa, but are cooperating with other areas.""
China regularly blames followers of Tibet's exiled god-king, the Dalai Lama, for anti-Chinese unrest that erupts sporadically in the strategic Himalayan region that borders India.
The Dalai Lama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his non-violent campaign to win autonomy for his homeland, says he wants self-government and freedom of worship in the deeply religious Buddhist region. He fled China in 1959 after an abortive uprising against Beijing rule.
Monks in the devout Buddhist region who have spearheaded anti-Chinese demonstrations and riots in the past were not regarded as suspects, the police official said.
Officials have vowed to retaliate, signalling a possible renewed crackdown on anti-Chinese unrest in the region.
""We should wage a tit-for-tat struggle against the Dalai clique's sabotage,"" local radio quoted Gyamco, vice chairman of the regional government as saying last week.
Several much smaller bombs have been been set off in Lhasa in the last two years, including one in 1995 that caused slight damage to a plaque donated by Beijing and another last March outside the headquarters of the Tibet regional government.

1220,"China is unlikely to concede on its demand to enter the World Trade Organisation as a developing country and has the patience to hunker down for a long wait to win accession on its terms, a senior Chinese analyst said.
""Both sides need to make concessions, but there is one issue of principle on which China will not change,"" Pei Changhong, head of the department of Foreign Economy and Trade under the leading think-tank, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told Reuters in an interview at the weekend.
""China will only enter as a developing country,"" Pei said, referring to one stumbling block -- that of Beijing's entry status. The United States insists that the size of China's economy ranks it as a developed country.
""This is a matter of principle,"" Pei said.
China was deeply disappointed when its application to join the world trade body as a founding member two years ago failed, and talks since in Geneva have proceeded at a snail's pace.
He said he expected little progress when ministers of the WTO's 125 member states meet in Singapore this week, with China attending under observer status, but said China would seize the opportunity to explain its stand in meetings on the sidelines.
""After we gain recognition of our status then the talks could more easily proceed,"" Pei said. ""There may be the possibility of concessions (by China) on some concrete issues.""
Pei declined to say where China might be prepared to offer concessions in line with a ""road map"" presented to Beijing by Washington outlining liberalisations it wants before it will support Chinese membership.
He said China's economy was already remarkably open compared with some of its neighbours such as Japan and South Korea.
""When you go shopping in Beijing you see goods from all over the world on every shelf,"" he said. ""You don't see nearly so many Chinese products on foreign shelves.""
Chinese President Jiang Zemin announced at the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum last month in the Philippines that China would slash average import tariffs to 15 percent by 2000 from the current 23 percent.
Pei said non-tariff barriers still existed in China, citing the service sector as one area to which foreign firms were eager to gain admittance, but insisted Beijing was gradualling pulling down these barriers.
""Opening up requires a process,"" he said. ""It is a fact that China is a backward country and must protect some parts of its economy. The demands on us must not be too harsh.""
Pei offered a less optimistic view than China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen who has said talks with the United States on entry could be wrapped up by mid-1997 as well as WTO chief Renato Ruggiero who has said next year could see a solution to the exclusion of the world's most populous nation from the world trade body.
Pei said 1997 seemed a rather ambitious target given the distance between the United States and China on many issues, but said he hoped to see entry by 1999.
""There are both advantages and disadvantages to China from entry to the WTO,"" Pei said, setting off the access to worldwide markets for Chinese goods against the cost and competition its domestic industry would face.
""China's stand now is that it is up to the other side,"" Pei said.
""China actively wants membership but it can wait. It will be good for China to enter but it won't be a catastrophe if we have to wait,"" he said.
""It is in no one's interests to keep China out.""

1227,"China's restive Tibet region appeared certain on Sunday to fall under the shadow of a renewed campaign of intimidation after a music student was jailed for 18 years for spying and a bomb rocked the capital.
""The bomb attack, especially such a big explosion, is a real slap in the face,"" said one Tibet observer who declined to be identified. ""The authorities really don't know any other way but the knee-jerk crackdown response.""
A senior local government leader signalled that a new round of intimidation in the deeply Buddhist Himalayan region was essential to tackle such challenges to Beijing's sovereignty.
""We should wage a tit-for-tat struggle against the Dalai (Lama) clique's sabotage,"" Gyamco, vice chairman of the regional government, was quoted by local radio as telling a Friday meeting of party government officials in Lhasa after the December 25 blast.
""We should, once again, stage another campaign across Tibet to thoroughly expose and criticise the Dalai clique, heighten our alertness and strengthen preventive measures so as to keep the situation stable,"" the radio quoted him as saying.
The explosion was certain to trigger further official rhetoric against the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled god-king, whom Beijing accuses of fomenting anti-Chinese unrest in the strategic mountainous region that borders India, analysts said.
The Dalai Lama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his non-violent campaign to win autonomy for Tibet, says he wants self-government and freedom of worship in the region.
He fled China in 1959 after an abortive uprising against Beijing rule.
Police had set up new checkpoints on the road west from Lhasa, visited hotels to question Tibetan guests, particularly exiles from India, and begun house-to-house questioning of young Tibetan men, the London-based Tibet Information Network said.
Diplomats said the extraordinarily harsh prison sentence meted out to music scholar Ngawang Choephol underlined the determination of authorities in the region to stamp out even the smallest activity that lacked an official sanction.
Ngawang Choephel, 30, was jailed last Friday by a court in Tibet's second city, Xigaze, for 18 years for spying, in one of the harshest sentences ever meted out in the region.
The student, a former Fulbright scholar in the United States, disappeared into China's security limbo in August 1995 while travelling in Tibet to produce an amateur documentary film about traditional music and dance.
The young scholar confessed to having been sent to Tibet by ""the Dalai (Lama) clique"" on behalf of an unnamed foreign country to conduct espionage, local radio said in a thinly veiled reference to the United States.
Washington voiced concern at the sentence, and said it knew nothing of his activities other than making a documentary.
""It appears to mean the end of any sense that China is susceptible to the international community on human rights issues,"" Robbie Barnett of the Tibet Information Network said after hearing of the sentence.
""They now feel confident to use counterespionage laws against political offenders,"" he said late on Friday.
But with the largest bomb explosion yet reported in Tibet rocking Lhasa before dawn on December 25, a renewed crackdown on anti-Chinese unrest appeared inevitable.
One Tibetan government official reached by telephone in Lhasa on Sunday said he could not comment on the bomb blast because he was too busy conducting a rectification and discipline drive in Lhasa's temples and monasteries.
The bomb exploded outside the main city government office in Lhasa, shattering windows in a 100-metre (yard) radius and prompting officials to condemn the blast as ""an appalling act of terrorism"". They said no one was wounded in the explosion.
""The act of terrorism...fully demonstrates that the Dalai (Lama) clique has cast off its previously so-called peaceful disguise to openly oppose the people of Tibet and has reached a point when it puts up a last-ditch struggle,"" local radio said.

1228,"The U.S. government's top Asian official, Winston Lord, left China on Thursday, wrapping up a low-profile visit after talks that focused on human rights in China and problems on the Korean peninsula.
Diplomats described the meetings as frank and cordial overall, even though Lord raised the thorny issue of China's treatment of its dissidents amid signs of a renewed crackdown by Beijing's communist rulers on their critics.
Lord, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, arrived on Tuesday for the previously unannounced visit and kept a low-profile while in Beijing, a U.S. embassy official said. He left for Japan on Thursday.
Lord held substantive discussions with Deputy Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu on Wednesday and also had a brief meeting with Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, diplomats said.
""They discussed a wide range of issues,"" one Western diplomat said.
The issue of Korea was one focus of the talks and although diplomats said there was little sign of concrete progress, the tone of discussion was positive.
""Both sides want to maintain stability on the peninsula,"" one diplomat said.
South Korea and the United States in April called for four-nation peace talks with North Korea and China to replace a truce that ended the Korean conflict but left Seoul and Pyongyang technically still at war.
Pyongyang has insisted on bilateral talks with Washington to seek an accord, saying Seoul was not a party to the 1953 truce. China has yet to take a clear stance on the four-way talks.
Frosty relations between Seoul and Pyongyang have been in crisis since last month, when 26 North Koreans landed in the South from a stranded submarine.
Diplomats said Lord's talks did not focus on any single issue, and a major aim of his trip was to prepare for a visit next month by Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
""Generally speaking relations are on the upturn,"" said one diplomat. Christopher is due to visit Beijing on November 21-22 on a trip originally announced in July.
A row over human rights scarred Christopher's last visit to China in 1993.
The visit would mark the highest point in relations since ties plunged after Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui paid a private visit to the United States in June 1995, a trip that enraged Beijing.
In Washington, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said Lord had raised Chinese treatment of dissidents.
""Human rights have been on our agenda quite importantly over the last couple of days, because of recent arrests of some of the political dissidents, and the recent travel to the United States of a noted champion of human rights. So, that issue for us is front and centre on our agenda with them.""
Washington last week sharply criticised the sentencing of dissident Liu Xiaobo to three years in a labour camp, as well as apparent plans to try another pro-democracy activist, Wang Dan, on the capital charge of plotting to subvert the government.
Diplomats in Beijing said China would almost certainly be angered by the arrival of a third dissident, Wang Xizhe, in San Francisco this week after escaping from China.
Both sides have said they were moving toward a possible exchange of presidential visits during 1997.
Among outstanding issues that could spark U.S. anger are China's alleged nuclear sales and human rights record while Beijing blames Washington for holding up its application for membership in the World Trade Organisation.

The 26-year-old former leader of the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations has been charged with the capital offence of plotting to subvert the government, based on evidence such as writings critical of the state and accepting funds from abroad.
""All he did was to say a few things,"" Wang Lingyun said. ""He is unjustly accused.""

The Beijing People's Intermediate Court had informed Wang Lingyun on Thursday that she had one day in which to find her son a lawyer, a signal that a trial was imminent.
Wang was detained by police in a raid on his home in May 1995 but was not formally arrested or charged until last week.
On Friday the family obtained a copy of the court indictment, which accused Wang Dan of plotting to subvert the government, a crime that carries a maximum penalty of death. The minimum sentence is 10 years, although the court can show leniency if it finds extenuating circumstances.
Wang has already served four years in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes, or subversion, for his role in the 1989 demonstrations centred in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, which were crushed by the army with heavy loss of life..
The indictment cited four major areas of evidence against Wang, the New York-based Human Rights in China said.
The first was the writing of articles published in overseas magazines and newspapers, including some that criticised the government, in the three years since his release from jail.
Other evidence against the former Beijing University student included taking part in studies at home organised by the University of California, Berkeley, in the United States, Human Rights in China said.
The charges accused Wang and other dissidents of joining forces to collect funds and donations to help other dissidents facing difficulties and failure to find work after their release from prison, the group said.
Wang was also accused of accepting donations and economic aid from overseas organisations, it said.
Wang had been expected to face new charges since last December, when the court that convicted veteran democracy activist Wei Jingsheng -- a nominee for this year's Nobel Peace Prize -- of plotting to overthrow the government also implicated the former student leader.
The court's verdict said Wei, who was jailed for 14 years, had links with people ""convicted of counter-revolutionary crimes, including Wang Dan"". It also referred to a tape-recorded conversation between Wang and Wei, but gave no details.
Wang had been active since his release from jail, defying persistent police surveillance and harassment to join in a daring appeal to communist leaders for the release of all those still in prison for their part in the 1989 protests.

1239,"Jailed, sentenced to labour camps, cowed or exiled, China's pro-democracy activists have virtually vanished.
The latest dissident to be swallowed by China's gulag was prominent literary critic Liu Xiaobo, sentenced on Tuesday to three years in a labour camp. Veteran democracy activist Wang Xizhe has simply disappeared.
Any hopes among Chinese dissidents of a revival of their beleaguered movement may lie with the Nobel Committee in Oslo and whether it decides on Friday to select Nobel Peace Prize nominee and veteran democracy activist Wei Jingsheng.
However, few in China expect Wei, regarded as the father of China's struggling democracy movement and serving the first year of a 14-year jail term, to win the Nobel Peace Prize and thus halt the slow demise of Chinese dissent.
Members of Wei's family said they did not consider him a serious contender because of the strength of competition from front runners such as Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. architect of Bosnia's peace treaty, and former U.S. president Jimmy Carter.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang voiced outrage at the suggestion on Thursday.
""I have already stressed many times that Wei Jingsheng is a criminal who has broken Chinese law. This kind of criminal basically has no qualifications to win any prize,"" he said.
Wei was jailed for 15 years for his role in the 1979 Democracy Wall movement when he wrote an article that called for democracy as China's ""Fifth Modernisation"" and attacked paramount leader Deng Xiaoping as a dictator.
He was released on parole in September 1993 after serving 14-1/2 years and re-arrested the following April. He was sentenced to 14 years last December for plotting to subvert the government.
""Would it make a great deal of difference?"" said one Western diplomat when asked about the impact if Wei were to win the Nobel Peace Prize. ""It wouldn't get him out any quicker. It would turn the international spotlight on China for a little while but that of itself would not be enough to get the (democracy) movement going again.""
Diplomats have expressed surprise at the rash of arrests and convictions of dissidents -- many of them sentenced to the administrative punishment of ""re-education through labour"" that avoids a complicated trial process.
""My feeling had been that the whole business was under control,"" the diplomat said. ""There are a few who pop up and engage in experiments to annoy the authorities but they are nothing serious or threatening to the regime.""
He attributed the new crackdown to a secret plenum of the Communist Party, expected to finish later on Thursday with a statement on the importance of ""spiritual civilisation"" -- or conformity to orthodox Marxist values.
""Everyone will be expected to think properly and so they may need to tidy up a remaining few loose ends,"" the diplomat said.
Liu Xiaobo, who gained fame during the 1989 student-led pro-democracy movement, was ordered to serve three years in a labour camp, a term imposed just hours after police detained him during a raid on his Beijing home.
Veteran pro-democracy activist Wang Xizhe, who recently joined Liu in a statement calling for the impeachment of President and party chief Jiang Zemin, had disappeared from his home in southern Guangzhou, his wife said.
On Thursday court officials told the family of Wang Dan, a detained dissident and leader of the 1989 student protests, to hire a lawyer on his behalf, his mother said. The Beijing People's Intermediate Court informed her that she had until Friday to find a lawyer, in a sign that his trial was imminent.
""They have had so many crackdowns in the past that most figures are under lock and key or safely out of the way abroad, and in either case pretty harmless,"" the diplomat said.

1242,"China has launched a manhunt across the restive region of Tibet, tightened airport security and offered a reward of $120,000 for the arrest of culprits who exploded a bomb in Lhasa last week, officials said on Monday.
The government had announced a reward of one million yuan ($120,000) for information leading to the arrest of those responsible for the bomb that exploded in the early hours of Christmas Day outside city government offices in the Tibetan capital, Lhasa, a senior official said.
""No one has yet been arrested and we are now mobilising and deploying our forces,"" Lhasa Vice Mayor Ou Yangxiang said in a telephone interview.
Notice of the reward had been published in the Lhasa Evening News on December 27 and it was being issued in other newspapers in the strategic Himalayan region, government officials said.
The Christmas Day bomb, the largest so far set off by anti-Chinese activists in restive Tibet, had resulted in no casualties but caused widespread damage, shattering windows for a radius of 100 metres (yards), officials said.
""Almost the whole of Lhasa heard it,"" said one Lhasa government official. ""It was a muffled sound, like -- whoong.""
Officials insisted there was little doubt that the blast was politically motivated and carried out by followers of the region's exiled god-king, the Dalai Lama.
""This was done by the Dalai separatist camp,"" the government official said, adding that the attack bore the hallmarks of previous similar ""terrorist acts"". He declined to give details although several smaller bombings have been reported in Lhasa.
""This is a terrorist act, aimed at destroying peace in our area,"" he said. ""This was a brazen act.""
Police had set up a special task force to search for the culprits and customs and immigration officials had stepped up security searches at Tibet's airport, he said.
A senior Tibet police official said the bomb was a home-made device made from ammonium nitrate, a fertiliser.
""We are targeting Tibetan exiles returning from abroad and who have political connections,"" he said when asked about the focus of the manhunt.
China regularly blames followers of Tibet's exiled god-king, the Dalai Lama, for anti-Chinese unrest that erupts sporadically in the strategic mountainous region that straddles the Himalayas and runs along China's sensitive border with India.
The Dalai Lama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his non-violent campaign to win autonomy for his homeland, says he wants self-government and freedom of worship in the deeply religious Buddhist region. He fled China in 1959 after an abortive uprising against Beijing rule.
Monks in the deeply devout Buddhist region who have spearheaded anti-Chinese demonstrations and riots in the past were not regarded as suspects, the police official said.
Officials have vowed to retaliate, signalling a possible renewed crackdown on anti-Chinese unrest in the region.
""We should wage a tit-for-tat struggle against the Dalai clique's sabotage,"" local radio quoted Gyamco, vice chairman of the regional government as saying last week.
""We should, once again, stage another campaign across Tibet to thoroughly expose and criticise the Dalai clique, heighten our alertness and strengthen preventive measures so as to keep the situation stable,"" the radio quoted him as saying.
Several much smaller bombs have been been set off in Lhasa over the last two years, including one in 1995 that caused slight damage to a plaque donated by Beijing and another last March outside the headquarters of the Tibet regional government.

1245,"Time in Tibet is a moveable feast.
In this far-flung outpost of Chinese rule, the clocks are synchronised with Beijing more than 2,560 km (1,590 miles) to the northeast, but dawn is two hours behind and everyone goes to work about two hours later than in Beijing.
It is not only Tibetan time that lags the rest of China. The economy in this Himalayan region, still based largely on yaks, goats and Buddhism, also trails.
Beijing says it is doing its utmost to narrow the gap and to make up for destruction wrought on Tibet's monasteries and temples in China's ultra-leftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.
It has pumped more than 35 billion yuan (US$4.2 billion) into the inaccessible, remote and backward region long peopled by nomadic herders and barter traders, officials say.
The funds are also useful to buttress control of the restive and strategically important region that borders India.
The investment is slowly paying off.
Economic growth in 1995 reached 10.6 percent, up from 8.6 percent the year before. Rural per capita incomes were about 600 yuan ($72) a year while urban incomes neared 2,000 yuan ($240) -- both still about half the national average but increasing rapidly.
In the capital Lhasa, the swift growth of commerce has taken even local leaders by surprise.
""I thought it would take several years before we could attract any real interest,"" said Chen Ciduan, president of the Tibet Investment and Trust Corporation that in 1994 set up a stocks trading centre in Lhasa.
""But we had to double our space last year and we are already overcrowded and making plans for another expansion,"" he said.
That's the high flying end of economic development in Tibet.
For those at the other end of the scale, Beijing is trying to make things easier with preferential policies to help a people struggling into the late 20th century from a lifestyle that more closely resembles the middle ages.
Income tax holidays, tax breaks and easy loans are just some of the incentives available to businessman in Tibet. The concessions are also attracting numerous entrepreneurs from elsewhere in China where such favourable policies are not available.
In Lhasa, one street specialises in selling the highly-decorated, colourfully-painted furniture favoured by Tibetans. Another sells fake leather sofas that appeal to Han Chinese residents.
Chinese restaurants abound, cheek by jowl with Tibetan-managed shops selling yak butter, computer parts and bolts of brocade and wool.
Tibet offers some of China's oddest employment opportunities.
In a tiny one-room workshop leased from a struggling state-owned factory processing yak horns, seven artisans from neighbouring Yunnan province hammer traditional silver bowls embossed with Buddhist symbols.
""We were already making these Buddhist artifacts in Yunnan anyway,"" said workshop owner Li Wenhan, 26. ""It's only because there is so much demand here that we came. We could easily sell these in Yunnan, but here they need them.""
Li said 40 percent of the goods they make are for export, 20-30 percent are sold to Tibetans and the rest distributed elsewhere in China.
The success of Li's business underscores a problem in Tibet that must be as frustrating for its Chinese masters seeking to lead the region into prosperity as for many educated Tibetans.
""The Tibetans lack education and a mentality of work,"" said one Tibetan-Nepali businessman who was born in Lhasa.
""They don't appreciate the need to work, they just want to make a profit straight away,"" he said. ""It's very sad. They are too impatient to understand that you have to earn a living through steady work.""
While some might dispute that view, no one questions that Tibet is among China's poorest and most inaccessible regions. Out of Tibet's 2.3 million people, about 400,000 live below the official poverty line.
Officials oversee one of China's most innovative anti-poverty policies in the deeply devout Buddhist area where many still donate much of what they earn to monasteries and temples and where education is costly.
""We are determined to bring all Tibetans out of poverty by the end of the century,"" said an official who declined to be identified.
Almost all Tibetan government officials are involved in anti-poverty programmes. Each government department in the Tibet Autonomous Region sends officials into rural areas each year -- both to see where government money and aid are most needed and to teach poverty-stricken nomads how to boost their incomes.
Many of Tibet's worst off are nomads living in remote mountain areas, many with large flocks of yaks, goats and sheep, but with little idea of how to exploit their resources.
The nomads either use their animals to feed themselves or, when their numbers climb, set them free as an offering to Buddha to try to win merit for their next reincarnation, believing that their station in each life is dependent on their behaviour in the previous one.
""Many of these people have assets but they are still poor because they don't know how to use them,"" the official said.
Tibet does not rely on handouts alone. Since last year it has worked at setting up sister relationships with 14 of China's booming eastern cities and provinces.
These wealthy cousins each send between 10 to 20 officials to work for three years in the region over a 10-year period and also provide financial resources.
The provinces are helping Tibet with 43 projects, mostly in infrastructure. Initial investment was 2.3 billion yuan ($277.1 million) but now totals more than 3.0 billion yuan ($361 million).
""Tibet's capacity to develop itself is very low,"" the official said. ""It's hampered by its geological conditions such as lack of infrastructure and its remoteness. And it takes a long time to move away from the previous feudal serf system.
""This is a very beautiful place but we have a very arduous task ahead.""

1256,"The Czech National Bank (CNB) has proposed merging savings bank Ceska Sporitelna, with foreign trade bank Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka a.s.(CSOB), and then privatising the new megabank which would be the largest in post-Communist Eastern Europe.
CNB spokesman Martin Svehla told Reuters that the proposal was part of a wide-ranging plan to privatise major stakes in the ""Big Four"" Czech banks, which had been submitted to the cabinet to prepare the banks for stiffer foreign competition.
""Continuing with the privatisation of these banks has the aim of increasing the competitiveness of banks, to fit them more towards (entry into) the European Union and to increase their performance,"" Svehla said.
The CNB however proposed holding off on privatisation of the new combined Sporitelna and SOB for three to five years until the effects of the merger were analysed.
Analysts said the new bank, based on 1995 results, would have combined assets of roughly 540 billion crowns ($20 billion), making it by far the largest bank in Eastern Europe and over twice the size of the next largest bank, Komercni Banka.
It is not clear when the cabinet will debate the CNB proposals, but a senior central bank official said it might be on the agenda of next Wednesday's government meeting.
Jack Schrantz, equities analyst at Creditanstalt Prague, said the merger would bring economies of scale from necessary cuts in Sporitelna's and CSOB's bloated workforces.
""There's got to be a lot of overlap. In many of these departments you would see big staffing cuts,"" he said.
The CNB plan calls first for quick privatisation of the state's 31.5 percent in Investicni a Postovni Banka (IPB), a suggestion endorsed by the Finance Ministry earlier this month.
Nomura and Dutch ING NV are widely seen as potential partners for IPB, although top officials have declined comment on their possible interest in IPB.
The CNB plan proposes privatising shares in Komercni Banka -- seen as the plum of the Big Four in which the state holds a 49 percent stake -- only as a final step.
Svehla said the plan was written from the perspective of the CNB as a regulator, aiming to consolidate the strengths in the core of the the Czech banking system.
Whether it has the support of the full cabinet is still unclear. Privatisation of the Big Four has been a delicate political issue despite the country's reputation as the most aggressive post-Communist reformer.
Svehla said however that there was broad agreement in the CNB and the government on the need to go forward with privatisating remaining state stakes in the Big Four, which control more than 70 percent of the country's banking activity.
Ceska Sporitelna, in which the state still holds a 45 percent stake after the government's stock-for-citizens privatisation programme, is the largest state savings bank, where most Czechs kept their money during the communist era.
It still holds a majority of Czech retail deposits.
CSOB, born as a foreign trade bank in the former communist state system, is owned by a variety of Czech and Slovak state institutions including both central banks and the Czech National Property Fund, with small stakes privately held.
""I think it will take a lot of time to agree on the merger price (with Slovak institutions),"" Schrantz warned. Slovak state institutions hold nearly 26 percent of CSOB shares
The daily Hospodarske Noviny quoted CNB governor Josef Tosovsky on Wednesday as saying large banks needed strong foreign partners which could cover share purchase from their own funds.
The market value of state stakes in the Big Four is about 55 billion crowns, according to the CNB, while the total value of Big Four shares is estimated at 111 billion crowns.
Such well-funded investors do not exist domestically, and the CNB wants to find them abroad through tenders.
Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik said earlier this month that he also wanted the state's stake in IPB to be the first to be privatised, and that a strategic foreign partner taking the stake would be the most likely option. ($ = 26.87 Czech Crowns)

1258,"Czech President Vaclav Havel on Thursday said he was deeply disturbed by a Chinese court's 11-year prison sentence on dissident Wang Dan who was accused of plotting to overthrow the government.
Havel, himself a former dissident against a Communist government, said in a statement that after the 14-year sentence last December against Wei Jingsheng, a leader of China's small democracy movement, Wang's sentence was ""unacceptable"".
Wang, 27, was sentenced to 11 years in prison on Wednesday after a brief hearing. Wei was sentenced to 14 years in jail last December on a similar charge.
Havel said in the statement issued by his spokesman, that Wang's sentence ""was another example of the unacceptable understanding of the position of the citizen in society.""
The statement added that Havel expressed his ""deep dissatisfaction"" over the decision.
It said Havel ""considers it his obligation to express his solidarity with those who anywhere around the world express, in a non-violent way, their free-mindedness and desire for justice and elementary human rights.""
Havel, once a dissident playwright imprisoned several times by a Communist government before its fall in 1989, has been a frequent diplomatic thorn in China's side.
The Czech president said earlier this year he regretted that Taiwan, which Bejing regards as a renegade province, is not a U.N. member. However, the Czechs officially still recognise only China as a sovereign state and not Taiwan.
Havel angered China last year with a highly publicised meeting with Taiwan's Premier Lien Chan, forcing a hurried re-statement of the Czechs' official ""One-China Policy"".
Earlier on Thusday, the Czech foreign ministry asked China's chief diplomat in Prague, charge' d'affaires Wang Zizhen, to the ministry where a statement of protest was read.
""The Czech Republic expresses its dissatisfaction over the conduct of the trial and the judgment carried out,"" said a text of the statement issued by the foreign ministry.
It said that although there were differences in traditions of understanding questions of human rights in different regions, ""there exist certain universal principles of maintaining human rights which are necessary to respect"".
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said in Beijing that the jailing was not a human rights issue but an ordinary legal matter.
The Czech ministry statement said criminalisation of freedom of speech was ""a violation of elementary human rights"".

1260,"Czech Justice Minister Jan Kalvoda, a deputy premier and leader of a junior partner in the ruling coalition, quit the government and parliament on Tuesday for falsely using an academic title, the CTK news agency said.
Kalvoda, aged 43, resigned for falsely claiming he was a doctor of law amid a growing row over the academic credentials of Czech politicians after deputies began questioning whether they were all genuine.
""Yes, (Kalvoda resigned) and he delivered his resignation to the president,"" Mariana Cerna of the parliament's press office told Reuters.
Another member of parliament from a party in the centre-right ruling coalition also quit the house for the same reason, while three other deputies admitted using false titles but did not step down, the news agency reported.
Officials of Kalvoda's party, the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA), were not immediately available for comment, and it was not yet clear who would take Kalvoda's place in the cabinet or what his status would be within his party.
Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, head of the senior Civic Democratic Party, said he would meet on Wednesday morning with Christian Democrat chairman Josef Lux and a designated member of Kalvoda's party to assess the situation in the three-party coalition.
""It's a political swerve, it's disquieting and unsettling, and the aim of all of us is that it would happen without any teetering,"" Klaus told reporters after Kalvoda's resignation.
ODA's press department said it would not comment until a meeting of its party leaders on Wednesday.
Kalvoda, who headed the most pro-business party in the coalition, often bumped heads with Klaus on issues such as speeding up the deregulation of heating prices and rents and lowering taxes.
Pavla Jurkova, a member of the Christian Democrats (KDU-CSL), resigned her seat in the 200-seat lower house -- where the centre-right coalition has 99 seats -- for falsely claiming a law doctorate, CTK said.

1274,"Volkswagen AG Czech unit, Skoda Auto a.s., on Friday launched sales of its new sedan, the Octavia, hoping to kill off jokes about Communist-era quality, and pull the company into profit.
Officials said the new model, built on a common VW platform designed for the 1998 Audi A3 and upgraded Golf, would expand Skoda's market penetration by putting the company's first post-Communist mid-sized car in showrooms worldwide.
""Our strategic markets are in central and eastern Europe, western Europe, and we are present in some Asian markets. We expect to sell Octavias successfully in all of our 66 markets,"" marketing director Frank Farsky told Reuters.
The new sedan received a hero's welcome at showrooms around the capital Prague on Friday as crowds gathered to watch dealers mount the Octavia on viewing pedestals.
Exports of the front-grilled Octavia -- a major step away from the boxy sub-compacts which made the Communist-era Skoda the butt of automotive jokes worldwide -- to Europe and beyond later this year or in the first quarter next year.
The car will be available on the domestic market with a choice of three petrol and two diesel engines, with the top-of-the-line SLX automatic model priced at 497,900 crowns, and a base model priced at 335,700 crowns.
""In the Czech market its more or less toward a luxury- class car by the nature the purchasing power and the nature of the car market itself,"" Farsky said.
""In western Europe it is a medium sized car that will belong to the middle class market, and in Asian markets I think it will be toward the luxury class,"" he added.
Skoda will make 64,000 Octavias in 1997 at its new purpose-built plant in Mlada Boleslav north of Prague, and raise production to 90,000 in 1998.
Skoda Chairman Ludvik Kalma said earlier this year he expected 20,000 Octavias to be sold annually on the home market, with the rest exported to Europe and points East.
""I think customers who would be looking for a used car would look at a Skoda Octavia, I think that people who own a smaller car would look at Octavia,"" Farsky said.
The company lost 1.621 billion crowns last year due to heavy investments into the new factory, but Kalma said the firm should come close to breaking even this year.

1276,"A stronger showing by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus's centre-right Civic Democratic Party in the first round of Senate elections may give a mild fillip to local financial markets, Czech analysts predicted.
But a thin turnout made it hard for the three-party coalition government, which lost its lower house majority in June, to claim it had recaptured voters' hearts, the analysts said.
""Nobody can jump to conclusions based on these figures, because if you take the total turnout, it's nothing,"" said Radek Maly, economist at Citibank Prague.
""We might see a mild strengthening of the crown, but we don't think any major movement,"" he added.
The currency has traded in a tight range recently at around 26.9 to the dollar and 17.8 to the mark or roughly 2.5 percent above parity with the central bank's mark/dollar basket.
But Maly stressed that the market was focused on macroeconomic fundamentals, not political influences.
Klaus's Civic Democratic Party won 36 percent of the nationwide vote on Saturday.
The centre-left opposition Social Democrats were second with 20 percent. The rest of the vote was thinly split among coalition parties and the Communists. Only 35 percent of the electorate voted.
Of the 81 Senate seats, Civic Democrats won three outright in the first round and 73 of their candidates go into next weekend's runoff as the top vote getter in their district.
The Civic Democrats took less that 30 percent of the vote in June's general elections, costing the coalition its majority in the lower house.
Miroslav Nosal, equities analyst at Prague investment house Patria Finance, said that a premature general election was probably not on the cards, and said the stock market had other concerns than party politics.
""Poor regulation and transparency is already included in the share prices, but from a fundamental point of view many stocks are quite attractive,"" said Nosal,
He said some foreign investors might be tempted to play on Klaus's victory early on Monday, but any gain based on the political situation would be short lived.

1288,"The Czech consumer price index rose 0.5 percent in October putting year-on-year inflation at 8.7 percent, down from 8.9 percent in September, the Czech Statistical Bureau said on Friday.
The moving 12-month average of inflation remained unchanged at 8.7 percent in October. The figures were most influenced by a full percentage point rise in food, drinks and tobacco prices during the month and a 1.2 percent rise in clothing prices.
Analysts said the overall result was in line with expectations or even a bit lower, as the second consecutive month of slowing in the year-on-year figure convinced some that the year-end rate would end below nine percent.
""This (October's inflation result) is slightly better than expected, but not a big surprise,"" said Vladimir Kreidl, analyst at Patria Finance said.
""Our forecast in unchanged at nine percent for average inflation (at the end of 1996), but 8.8 percent seems to be achievable,"" he said.
Kreidl added that October's result was aided more by a strong Czech crown keeping import prices in check and relatively slow growth in industrial producer prices which have been rising at a roughly four percent annual rate.
Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy told a news conference the result was expectated and ""for the whole year, I would like to see (average inflation) at below 8.7 percent.""
The government had forecast average inflation to slow a full percentage point in 1996 to 8.0 percent, but a surge in domestic demand kept prices stubbornly over nine percent in the first half of the year.
The Czechs have been encouraged by the Organisation for Economic Coopoeration and Development (OECD), the group of the most industrialised countries to which the Czechs now have membership, to do more to stem inflation.
""From the perspective of an OECD member, our inflation is high ...our economic policy has to lead to a lowering inflation suggested by OECD and the Maastricht treaty,"" Dlouhy said.
The Czech National Bank (CNB) in June tightened monetary policy by raising its key interest rates and expanding minimum reserve requirements to dampen domestic demand.
The central bank said last week the moves served to pull its key M2 measure of money supply growth at the end of August to the low end of its 13-17 percent 1996 target at 13.2 percent, from over 20 percent earlier this year.
But Kreidl said the effects of the money supply tightening should not be evident until well into 1997, and he did not expect the CNB to ease credit rates at least until then.

1289,"The head of the Czech Republic's largest bank is on a crusade to clean up the emerging post-communist banking sector from within and, he hopes, from a seat in the Senate.
Dr Richard Salzmann, the bow-tied president of Komercni Banka, says the Czech banking system is fundamentally sound and getting stronger despite a handful of recent failures among smaller institutions.
But, he says, the whole Czech economy needed a dose of ""fairness and transparency"" to clean up old habits of secrecy and ensure banks are not run as private fiefdoms.
He is standing for a seat in the newly-established Czech Senate at elections in November, saying he wants to help bring back ""good manners"" to the banking industry and restore the reputation of the Czech finance sector.
Better risk management is crucial, according to Salzmann.
He said that Komercni and the three other large banks -- which comprise about 80 percent of all Czech banking activity -- had bolstered their reserves to meet Western banking standards, and had developed more effective risk management techniques.
""As concerns ""The Big Four', (the situation) is, for sure, very good, because all these big four banks in the last years have built up huge reserves,"" Salzmann said during a visit to the PGA Czech Open golf tournament here recently.
""It's true that we have an unusually high proportion of risky loans in our portfolios, which is partially inherited from the past. Other (bad loans) were made in this era of euphoria, after the (1989 revolution ending Communism).""
He said from branches to front office, Komercni has stepped up risk management techniques which have now been also adopted by Ceska Sporitelna,  Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, and Investicni a Postovni Banka -- the others in ""The Big Four"".
""Now we are in the final stage when we are building a central risk assessment department, which supervises all kinds of risks, not only from credit but also from the capital market operations and from the foreign operations.""
FAILURES EXPOSE PROBLEMS
Salzmann said he believed the recent failure of Kreditni Banka a.s., a medium-sized bank which became the eighth to shut in the post-communist era, stemmed, like others before it, from greed and naivete.
""I would blame mostly the founders of the banks, because they provided for themselves various kinds of privileges. They were, in most cases in my opinion, those who did not come with the intention to rob the money and disappear or something like that, I don't say that,"" Salzmann contended.
""But many of them founded the bank with false ideas that (their) bank would be able to provide themselves with easier conditions and lower prices for money for their internal use.""
Salzmann said these bad lending practices spiraled until the banks were forced to raise their rates and tighten lending conditions for regular customers.
""This snowballed from the naivete at the beginning,"" he said.
Kreditni suffered losses reportedly at more than 10 billion Czech crowns ($381.1 million) through a series of large loan defaults and on August 8 the central bank withdrew its banking licence.
The local press has been ripe with allegations of mismanagement and murky loan operations at many of the failed institutions, but criminal investigations have yet to produce any charges.
Officials from Kreditni Banka have refused to comment on reasons for its failure, but its controlling shareholder, the large insurer Ceska Pojistovna, chalked it up simply to bad decisions by bank management on loans and loan guarantees.
Salzmann, 67, said problems in the banking system were part of a bigger problem of honesty and fairness throughout the economy.
He said that if elected, he would push to expand the enforcement power of regulators to police dubious practices in banks, investment funds, and on the capital market, which is consistently hampered by charges of insider trading.
BANKER SEEKS POLITICAL PLATFORM
""My (candidacy), is to bring to this freshly-introduced capitalism more decency...a better field for good business,"" said Salzmann.
The erudite banker, who often recalls the days of thriving Czech capitalism between wars, said he would work in the Senate to establish an independent capital market watchdog like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Salzmann resigned as the chairman of the Prague Stock Exchange earlier this year -- a mostly honorary position -- to allow his friend and party colleague Tomas Jezek to take over as a full-time, hands-on leader of the bourse.
Both Jezek and Salzmann will run for the Senate in separate constituencies, and both support starting up a market-supported watchdog beefed up from the currently understaffed and underfunded Finance Ministry regulation department.
But Salzmann, who said he cannot by contract retire from the bank for at least one more year, rejects charges that his membership in the Senate while heading the country's largest banking group would constitute a conflict of interest. There is no legal requirement in the Czech Republic for legislators to suspend their business interests when they enter parliament.
Salzmann insists he would never use his Senate seat to gain advantages for his bank, but he makes no apologies about using his seat to try to improve the banking and business environment overall.
""I will support all such measures to bring more fairness, decency, good manners, transparency, all those principals which are, of course, favourable for the banks. So in that sense I will be perhaps in a conflict of interest,"" Salzmann said.
When asked if that meant he would support laws which would separate the banks and their investment arms, many of which control major chunks of the Czech economy -- like at Komercni Banka -- Salzmann answered:
""Yes, transparency, mandatory transparency."" ($1=26.24 Czech Crown)

1297,"Czech analysts on Sunday said the domination of pro-market Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus's party in the weekend's first-round Senate elections would have a neutral to mildly positive effect on local financial markets on Monday.
But they said thin voter turnout made it hard for Klaus and his three-party coalition to conclude that the electorate had swung back to their clear favour after they lost their majority in June lower house elections.
""Nobody can jump to conclusions based on these figures, because if you take the total (voter) turnout, it's nothing,"" said Radek Maly, economist at Citibank Prague.
""We might see a mild strengthening of the crown, but we don't think any major movement,"" he added.
The currency has traded in a tight range recently at around 26.9 to the dollar and 17.8 to the mark or roughly 2.5 percent above parity with the central bank's mark/dollar basket.
But Maly stressed that the market was focused more on macroeconomic fundamentals and not political influences.
Klaus's rightwing ODS on Saturday won 36.47 percent nationwide compared with 20.47 percent for the second place centre-left opposition Social Democrats (CSSD), with the rest thinly split among coalition parties and the Communists.
That after ODS won by just three percentage points at 29.6 percent over CSSD in the June general elections, costing the coalition a 12-seat majority in the lower house.
The ODS won three seats of the total 81 Senate seats outright in the first round of the Senate vote by taking over 50 percent, and put 73 of their candidates in next weekend's runoff election as the top vote getter in their district.
But only 35 percent of a confused and uninspired Czech electorate voted in the poll for the newly-created Senate, after more than 70 percent voted in the June general elections.
Miroslav Nosal, equities analyst at Prague investment house Patria Finance, said that a premature general election was probably not on the cards, and said the stock market had other concerns than party politics.
""Poor regulation and transparency is already included in the share prices, but from a fundamental point of view many stocks are quite attractive,"" said Nosal,
He said some foreign investors might be tempted to play on Klaus's victory early on Monday, but any gain based on the political situation would be short lived.
Unless the runoffs build on ODS's success next weekend with much higher turnout, analysts said it was unlikely that Klaus would move for new lower house polls in an effort to win back the coalition's majority in the more powerful lower house.
""If ODS sees a sweeping victory next week...then they might feel tempted for a possible early election in a year or so, but I think they should be very careful about it,"" said Maly.
Klaus, who as with other ministers is a member of the lower house, late on Saturday was reserved on possible early general elections.
""I've said many times this country does not need another election. It needs to function, work,"" Klaus said in a panel discussion on Czech Television, adding, ""If the Senate vote gives a chance to go forward, it'll be good for all of us.""

1298,"Czech fund manager Harvard Capital &amp; Consulting (HC&amp;C) said on Tuesday it paid a one million crown ($36,500) fine for illegal trading practices from 1993 to 1995, and was making amends.
In a statement HC&amp;C said that Viktor Kozeny, the young Czech-born entreprenuer who founded HC&amp;C, which is not connected to the U.S. college where he once studied, confirmed from his home in the Bahamas that the fine was paid in June.
""The discovered deficiencies from 1993 to 1995 have mostly been removed. We are working on correcting the others,"" HC&amp;C vice-president Boris Vostry said in the statement obtained from Harvard's Prague public relations agency.
The Finance Ministry on Monday said it had levied the maximum fine allowed by Czech law on HC&amp;C, which became one of the most visible symbols of renascent Czech capitalism during the country's privatisation wave of the early 1990s.
The firm was cited for several violations of the law on investment companies and funds and forced it to pay additional compensation, the ministry said, but did not elaborate.
Marie Jezkova, the head of the ministry's department of fund supervision, told Reuters that Harvard was cited primarily for the manipulation of assets of its publicly-held closed-end Harvard Guarantee &amp; Multiple Fund.
She said that the violations included ""dealing with the assets of the fund with unprofessional care"".
Jezkova said that Harvard conducted trades which ""did not indicate that they were done with the aim to increase the value of the assets of the fund"".
Vostry said one of the reasons for the fine was the frequent encroachment of the maximum limits for the purchase of shares in individual companies.
At the time, funds were limited to holding a maximum 20 percent stake in any one company.
Vostry did not list other infractions.
Jezkova was reacting to repeated inquiries concerning a story published last week in the U.S. magazine Fortune.
The magazine quoted a still unpublished ministry decision which it said was handed down in July, which required Harvard to pay a one million crown penalty and $6.8 million in compensation to its funds for various activities.
Jezkova declined comment on the total amount of compensation Harvard was required to pay, but she said that the ministry did impose the maximum fine allowable by law, and that Harvard did have to pay additional compensation.
She also declined to discuss any details of the decision, and said it was up others at the ministry to publish such information.
It is not clear why the decision had been kept secret.
Key ministry personnel have been unavailable during the holiday season.
The infractions described by Fortune concern Harvard's management of funds which were set up during the massive Czech voucher privatisation programme, which gave share vouchers to citizens for a nominal fee.
Kozeny, like many banks and private entrepreneurs, set up funds based on shares gained from citizens who transferred their vouchers to the funds. The citizens received shares in the funds for the vouchers.

1300,"North America's major gold companies are waging an expensive battle to win the coveted title of world's biggest gold producer.
""We want more of the action,"" said Hugh Leggatt, spokesman for Vancouver-based gold firm Placer Dome Inc.. ""We want to be positioned in the industry as a bigger player.""
Placer Dome has made a $600 million bid for Highlands Gold Ltd. of Papua New Guinea and the 25 percent of Placer Pacific Ltd.  it does not already own.
The company also plans to raise $300 million through a preferred share issue and sell off some small Canadian mine properties.
Placer also has its eye on Bre-X Minerals Ltd., a Calgary, Alberta-based exploration company that discovered what could become one of the world's largest gold mines, the Busang deposit in Indonesia.
But Bre-X is also crucial to Barrick Gold Corp.'s plan to become the world's biggest gold company.
Toronto-based Barrick is already the the world's most profitable gold company and North America's biggest, but it wants to surpass Anglo American Corp. of South Africa Ltd. and Gold Fields of South Africa Ltd. to be the world's largest.
Barrick, through skilful navigation of Indonesian politics, appears to have Bre-X within its grasp. Jakarta has asked the two companies to form a joint venture to develop the 57 million ounce Busang deposit, with Barrick controlling 75 percent.
Denver-based Newmont Mining Corp. was interested in Bre-X, but when Barrick appeared to gain the upper hand, Newmont turned its sights to Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corp., a mid-tier gold company.
Although Newmont seems to have lost out on its stock swap offer for Santa Fe to a $2.3 billion competing bid from Homestake Mining Co., analysts said Newmont was still hunting for other takeover targets.
""This is a very capital-intensive industry and it's becoming a global industry,"" Newmont spokesman Doug Hock said in an interview.
""In order to compete, you have to have large resources to do that. What you see is the larger players becoming bigger in order to compete.""
Homestake is poised to become North America's second-biggest gold company after Barrick if its takeover of Santa Fe succeeds.
Major gold companies are under pressure from their shareholders to keep gold reserves growing, analysts said.
""If one company gets big, they have a lot of clout in the marketplace to acquire properties or resources,"" said gold analyst Michael Fowler of brokerage Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion.
With gold bullion prices in a steep decline, the share prices of many mid-tier companies have been hit, making takeovers cheaper, Fowler said.
But he said the current leaders of the gold world, the South Africans, were not caught up in the recent consolidation.
""It looks as though they're losing out to the North Americans,"" said Fowler. ""They're behind the eight-ball really.""
North American gold producers were geared to react aggressively and quickly, but the South African producers concentrated more on paying dividends, he said. ""They don't move very fast.""
Analysts said this round of deal-making was far from over as major gold companies fought it out to satisfy their shareholders' thirst for growth.
Analysts said possible future takeover targets included large mid-tier producers such as Dayton Mining Corp., Battle Mountain Gold Co., Cambior Inc. and Echo Bay Mines Ltd..

1313,"Consolidated Eurocan Ventures Ltd , a small Canadian mining exploration company, was poised to gain control of one of the world's largest unexplored copper-cobalt discoveries on Friday.
The Zaire government agreed to a deal with the Vancouver-based company backed by Geneva-based Swedish financier Adolf Lundin, spokesmen from both sides told Reuters in Zaire. The deal gives Gecamines, Zaire's state-owned mining company, a 45 percent stake in the huge Tenke Fungurume deposit. Eurocan will have a 55 percent stake, sources said.  
A spokeswoman for Eurocan in Vancouver said she expected official confirmation by Monday morning.
Eurocan has said it expected to win the property for US$250 million and a commitment to develop the property.
""It's a very satisfactory deal for Eurocan, if they've got it,"" said Andrew Milligan, president of Cornucopia Resources Ltd, a Vancouver-based company that had also had its eye on Tenke Fungurume.
""It's one of the best projects anywhere in the world.""  
Cornucopia had formed a tentative consortium last spring with metals giants Inco Ltd and Phelps Dodge Corp, hoping to submit a proposal for the project.
But Eurocan's pact freezes Cornucopia out of the running.
The deal gives a hint of some stability in Zaire's business world, said Ken MacLeod, president and chief executive of International Panorama Resource Corp, another Vancouver-based company exploring in Zaire.
""It gives a signal that the government is working and it's in business,"" he said in an interview. ""From an investment perspective, it's a powerful message.  
""It means when Gecamines gets involved in an agreement, the government backs them up.""
But some analysts were concerned about the high risks involved in doing business in Zaire, a country plagued by political uncertainty and overrun by crowds of refugees from neighboring Rwanda.
""Zaire is a basketcase,"" said mining analyst Tony Hayes at brokerage Credifinance in Toronto.
The amount of money Eurocan will have to invest and pay for the project is ""ridiculous"" for the return and the risk the company can expect, he said.
Milligan estimated it would cost about US$300 million for initial development of Tenke Fungurume and up to US$3 billion in total capital costs.
The project was previously explored by a consortium led by Anglo American Corp of South Africa Ltd, which invested almost US$300 million in the project in the 1970s but walked away because of political risk.

1335,"Canada's Bre-X Minerals Ltd could face a multi-billion-dollar lawsuit over the ownership of its spectacular Busang gold deposit in Indonesia.
The young Calgary-based company said Friday that one of its Indonesian partners, PT Krueng Gasui, threatened it and 19 others with legal action in Canadian courts, claiming damages of US$1.9 billion.
""I find it curious that PT Krueng Gasui has chosen to threaten a lawsuit in Canada relating to matters that allegedly occurred in Indonesia,"" Bre-X chief executive David Walsh said in a statement. ""However, we will sit down with them and listen to what they have to say.""
Krueng Gasui owns an undisputed 10 percent of one section of the Busang discovery. It claims it owns up to 40 percent of the entire deposit, but Bre-X says the Indonesian company does not have the documentation to back up its claims.
Bre-X, which closed down C$1 at 20.90 in heavy trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange, said Friday it had received a letter from its Indonesian partner demanding a meeting before November 22 to resolve the dispute. If Bre-X refuses or does not make an attempt to settle the argument, Krueng Gasui will sue, the letter said.
Bre-X said it has asked its lawyers to arrange a meeting.
""In my opinion, this (threat of a lawsuit) appears to be a last minute act of desperation,"" said gold analyst Chad Williams of Research Capital Corp.
""My question is, why have they waited so long? And why did they choose to do this in Canada?""
The dispute between Bre-X and Krueng Gasui, who is backed by Australia's Golden Valley Mines NL, became public at the beginning of October.
The argument prompted the Indonesian government to delay issuing vital contracts of work until the two parties worked out their difficulties. Without the contracts, Bre-X cannot proceed with work on Busang and has had to stall its search for a major gold producer to operate or buy the discovery, analysts say.
""The key is how the Indonesian government will react"" to the lawsuit, said Williams.
The threat of a lawsuit gives Bre-X a strong incentive to settle with Krueng Gasui and Indonesian businessman Jusuf Merukh, who controls Krueng Gasui, said gold analyst Catherine Gignac of Deacon Capital.
While most analysts said it was too early to tell whether the Indonesian case would stand up in Canadian court, they said the threat of a lawsuit will definitely force Bre-X to treat the claims more seriously.
""It reinforces the uncertainty with respect to Bre-X,"" said gold analyst John Ing of Maison Placements. ""My sense is this thing is not going away. This is more of a manoeuvring than an actual threat, but it does not look like this will end any time soon.""
Krueng Gasui said in its letter that it will also sue the other Indonesian partners of Bre-X, some Bre-X officers and Canada's Minorca Resources Inc., which has a small stake in the discovery.
Minorca president Roland Horst said his company has no reason to be involved.
Exploration at Busang has outlined 47 million ounces of gold so far, and some analysts predict there could be up to 100 million ounces.

1345,"Inco Ltd's huge nickel, copper and cobalt property at Voisey's Bay in remote Labrador keeps getting bigger, with 11 drill rigs working around the clock to define three enormous deposits that promise to upset the world's metals markets.  
""There are a couple hundred million tonnes for sure, close to proven,"" said Greg Soper, a drill manager for Archean Resources, which has an exploration contract until the end of the year at the Northern site on a sub-Arctic land mass that is closer to Greenland than to much of the rest of Canada.
""This here is a world class deposit. Every week we're hitting stuff,"" said Soper, waving his arm to point at the vast stretch of bog and thin forest surrounding the round, rocky hill where metals were discovered two years ago.  
Inco's most recent calculations, compiled in an internal report at the end of August, showed 138 million tonnes of resource (corrects from ""proven or probable reserves"") spread out over three different deposits at the Voisey's Bay property. Resources are potential reserves.
On average, the deposits graded 2.09 percent nickel, 1.24 percent copper and 0.99 percent cobalt, the report said.
At the Ovoid deposit, found close to the surface of a bog close to the Labrador Sea, drilling has outlined 37.5 million tonnes. Exploration is finished at the Ovoid and Inco now plans to mine the area through an open pit mine.  
The Eastern Deeps, which lies under a series of hills covered with sparse trees and lush moss, has not yet been defined.
Recent calculations showed 75.5 million tonnes of ore, but the deposit was open in all directions.
To the west of the Ovoid, in the Western Extension, drills are uncovering another rich deposit. The mineralization was uncovered last April, after Diamond Fields Resources Inc, the owner of Voisey's Bay, accepted Inco's C$4.3 billion takeover offer.  
So far, drilling has defined 24.7 million tonnes, but the deposit is growing steadily.
Both the Eastern Deeps and the Western Extension need extremely deep holes to strike significant metal, and each major hole takes about three weeks to drill, said Soper.
More than 340 holes have been completed so far, with a total drilling meterage of more than 135,000 metres, Inco said in its recent mine and mill project description.
""Over half of our holes are good. They're mineralized,"" said 25-year-old geologist Mary Vaughan as she examined a new box of core samples just brought in from the Eastern Deeps.  
""It just blows you away. It's an explorationist's dream.""
Archean Resources plans to keep drilling at a breakneck pace until its contract ends in December.
Inco has not said whether it will extend Archean's contract, but the Toronto-based company has promised to spend C$20 million over the next four years on exploration.
Only five percent of the property has been explored so far, but small exploration companies that have claims surrounding Inco's 495-square-kilometre site have not found anything significant.  
New resource calculations are expected within the next month, Rick Gill, spokesman for Inco subsidiary Voisey's Bay Nickel Co told Reuters in St. John's, Newfoundland.
Mining at Voisey's Bay is expected to last at least 20 years, with a concentrator on site handling 15,000 tonnes of ore a day. Mining will likely continue all year round, despite high winds, extremely cold temperatures and thick ice that locks in the site for a few months every winter.
""The information that we have at this time suggests it will be possible to operate year 'round with ice breaker support,"" said Gill.

1351,"France's state-owned electricity utility Electricite de France (EDF) said on Wednesday it had made a 850 million franc asset gain selling its 10 percent stake in Sweden's Sydkraft AB to Norway's Statkraft SF.
""It allows us to realise a big asset gain and the deal is also the start of an alliance with Statkraft,"" EDF chairman Edmond Alphandery told a news conference.
EDF officials said the alliance with Statkraft, also a state-owned utility, would mainly be in the form of cooperation in hydroelectric projects in southeast Asia.
EDF is selling its 6.808 million class A and 12.395 million class C shares in Sydkraft AB to Statkraft for a sum of 2.130 billion francs. This allows the Norwegian firm to increase its stake in Sydkraft to 15 percent. The formal transfer of ownership will take place in November.
EDF took its stake in Sydkraft, Sweden's biggest power firm, two years ago but it changed its strategy in April when its Northelec unit obtained a 25 percent stake in Graningeverkens AB, Sweden's number six power group. It later raised the stake.
Northelec is a joint venture with Skanska.
""It's better to have a big stake in a small company than to have a small stake in a big company,"" Alphandery said.
""At Sydkraft we did not even have a seat on the board, at Graninge we have a shareholders' pact allowing us to effectively control the company,"" he added.
EDF has a shareholders pact with Sweden's industrial family Versteegh and jointly they own 54 percent of Graninge.
""We saw the strategic value of the Nordic market and we have been able to cash in on the asset gain because the value of Sydkraft shares has risen a lot,"" he said.
Alphandery, a former economics minister named to EDF in November to replace Gilles Menage who was an appointee of the former Socialist government and an aide to Francois Mitterand, said the sale was proof of EDF's willingness to ""realise an asset gain when there is one.""
He did not expect further sales from EDF's international portfolio. The French utility in 1996 alone has made commitments totalling 4.6 billion francs in foreign stakes and Alphandery said EDF would continue its expansion mainly in the Mercosur area in Latin America and in southeast Asia including China.
EDF obtained a stake in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro power utility Light and Edenor in Argentina. Last year, it obtained stakes in two Hungarian companies. It als has investments in Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ivory Coast and South Africa.
""We can use the asset gain on Sydkraft to finance our international expansion,"" Alphandery said.
""This refocusing of Northern European strategy shows EDF's desire to be a major international and industrial operator, actively managing its investment portfolio,"" EDF said.
EDF's decision to leave Sydkraft makes Germany's Preussen Elektra AG, a unit of Veba AG, the biggest shareholder with 17.6 percent of shares and 27.1 percent of votes. The city of Malmo is second biggest with 11.8 percent of shares and 18.9 percent of votes, followed by Statkraft and some pension funds.
Sydkraft has a 20 percent stake in Graninge and Veba's Preussenelektra 12.4 percent.

1352,"French state-owned Air France said on Thursday it was ready to take on the toughening competition in its domestic market posed by British Airways Plc (BA).
BA's TAT French unit on Wednesday announced a joint 780 million franc bid ($151.2 million) with bank Rivaud for domestic carrier Air Liberte that will double its share of takeoff and landing slots at Paris' busy second airport Orly to 20 percent.
An Air France spokeswoman acknowledged BA's increased presence in France aviation would have an impact.
""It certainly has consequences for us. But we will continue with improving our product and service while cutting our costs and prices,"" she said.
BA, one of the world's most profitable airlines, will in first instance manage its French assets from a distance. TAT and Air Liberte will operate separately at least until 1999 when the latter should have returned to profit.
The Creteil commercial court will meet on Friday to study the BA/Rivaud offer while an Air Liberte creditors meeting has the final say. Such a meeting is due within a month.
But the way to the finish line is not without obstacles.
In Brussels, Richard Branson's Virgin Express said it planned to raise its bid for Air Liberte, in administration since September 26. The court-appointed administrator, Maitre Baronnie, reacted sceptically.
""I have never seen any bid by Virgin so I do not see how they can increase a bid,"" he told Reuters by telephone.
""Strictly theoretically, a new bid could be made just up to the moment that the creditors meet and accept the offer on the table. In the end the creditors decide,"" he added.
The pilot's union of Air France's domestic unit Air France Europe urged the government and chairman Christian Blanc to also make a bid for Air Liberte.
""It will allow our country to remain master of its skies. Otherwise, there will not be any French competition because there will be no French air transport industry left,"" the SNPL pilots union said in a statement.
Air France is constrained from expanding in France until 1997, under conditions imposed on European Commission for state rescue cas.
Air Inter dominated mestic routes and Orly airport until as recently 1995 when the French government decided to open some major domestic routes to competition ahead of full liberalisation from April 1997.
A spokesman for Air Inter, now renamed Air France Europe, said the company had at the moment a 60 percent share on the total French market.
Air Liberte, AOM and TAT have all tried to carve out market share ahead of liberalisation with a price war. As a result they have suffered financially.
Industry sources said Air France could strike back in 1997 and make a bid for AOM to prevent another foreign airline from setting foot in France alongside Brr airlines in France are Air Littoral, owned by the Dufour family, the Dubreuil family's Regional airlines, Xavier Leclerq's Brit Airlines as well as Nouvelles Frontieres' Corsair and Euralair.

1355,"Daewoo Electronics on Tuesday tried to placate French critics of its planned purchase of Thomson Multimedia with job and investment promises while calling a counter-bid ""not realistic""
But Bae Soon-hoon, chairman of the South Korean company, declined to discuss financial details of the proposed takeover until the French government's decision to sell the world's fourth-biggest television maker became final.
Both the French Privatisation Commission and the European Commission still have to approve the deal.
The French government announced last week it had selected Lagardere Groupe over Alcatel Alsthom to buy state-owned Thomson SA for one franc after an 11 billion franc ($2.12 billion) capital injection.
Lagardere plans to merge its Matra Defence Espace unit with defence electronics group Thomson-CSF and sell off Thomson Multimedia (TMM) to Daewoo, also for one franc.
The French financial newspaper La Tribune on Monday suggested a rival French bid for TMM could still emerge. The Liberation daily on Tuesday said Sagem, which fell out of the race earlier on, was preparing such a bid.
Sagem denied planning a bid, however, and the idea was dismissed by Bae.
""I saw the newspaper article. I thought it was a joke,"" he said. ""We have been working with the government for six months and have been respecting the rules of the procedure. Unless the government changes the procedure, nobody can make a proposal at the present time.""
Bae said he planned to make Thomson Multimedia, reported to have made a three billion franc first half loss and to have debts of at least 14 billion, ""very profitable and prosperous.""
He confirmed a pledge to create 5,000 French jobs at TMM in five years, saying French labour conditions were competitive.
The partnership between Thomson Multimedia and Daewoo, which will create the world's biggest maker of televisions, video recorders and cathode ray tubes, would allow a 13 billion franc worldwide investment plan between now and 2000.
Daewoo said that would create a total of 6,600 jobs in final assembly and 2,500 jobs in component production.
Bae declined to indicate how much of Thomson Multimedia's debt Daewoo would assume but said he expected some of the state capital injection to go to TMM.
""The Daewoo group will keep a significant part of the TMM debts and has the means to do so,"" said Michel Jacob, managing director of Daewoo's French financial advisers Rothschild's.
Daewoo said it would keep the Thomson identity and French headquarters and would continue research and development in the French city of Rennes. It said all the group's products would be sold under Thomson brand names in Europe and the U.S.
The digital television know-how of Thomson will be put in a special joint venture with Lagardere. Bae said the joint-venture would be 50/50 owned, while Jean-Luc Lagardere said on Saturday his group would have a 51 percent majority.
The government decision to sell TMM indirectly for one franc to Daewoo has attracted fierce criticism, with Socialist Party leader Lionel Jospin saying he was ""shocked"".
Jacques Delors, former president of the European Commission, said at the weekend: ""I would have preferred to maintain a European pole in consumer electronics.""

1363,"Shares in French sports equipment maker Groupe Salomon SA fell sharply for the second day in a row on Thursday after a long and steady rise which saw the share more than double in value this year.
Dealers said that the company, headed by Jean-Francois Gautier and based in the mountain region of Annecy in the east of France, had become the victim of a number of rumours which cast a pall over the dynamic picture of the company.
Salomon executives were in London on Thursday on the second day of an investors' road-show, discussing the recent first half sales figures.
""There are two rumours in the market. One is that a Japanese distributor has gone bankrupt, which could cost the company money, and the other is that the roadshow is going badly,"" a share dealer said.
Salomon was down 17 francs, or 3.83 percent, at 427 francs at 1141 GMT after having given in 26 francs on Wednesday.
""In fact one of our distributors in Japan, Olympic Sports Co has gone bankrupt. But that is already in the first half figures and it will not change anything on the group level,"" Salomon spokeswoman Linda Champtenois told Reuters.
Olympic Sports applied for court mediation with creditors on September 20 with debts of 34.83 billion yen and the Japan Securities Dealers Association (JSDA) cancelled the company's Over-the-Counter registration.
Salomon's Champtenois said that ""everybody knows about the difficult market for winter sport equipment in Japan"" and brushed off the effect on Salomon's results.
Meanwhile Salomon's Japanese subsidiary Salomon &amp; Taylor Made Co was trading in Tokyo at 810 yen, just above its life low of 790 yen and far below its year high of 1,790 yen. It was introduced on the OTC market in November 1995 at 1,800 yen.
On November 5, the Japanese unit reduced its parent six-months net results forecast to 288 million yen from 620 million yen and a comparable figure of 556 million.
Champtenois said that the roadshow in London had been long planned, followed on a September 30 visit to Edinburgh and was ""going fine"".
French dealers said that even if the rumours were unfounded and the Japan effect limited, they were a catalyst for profit-taking, especially now that the French market has hit a year high at a level not seen since in 1994.
Salomon has been a stock market darling. From a low of 171.50 francs on March 14 in 1995, Salomon rose to an all-time high of 494 francs on October 22 this year.
On October 30, it said its first half sales to end September, at constant currency rates, rose by 21.8 percent to 2.021 billion francs.
While hiking equipment -- walking boots and mountain gear -- was up by 68 percent and the Taylor Made golf equipment brand had a 77 percent increase in sales. Winter equipment, however, was down 16 percent. The Mavic cycle brand was up 4.1 percent.
Salomon had earlier forecast that its operating results for the 1996/97 year would be stable due to the cost of further diversification into snowboards with the aqcuisiion of Bonfire and the planned launch of new boards, shoes and fixtures in 1997 as well as new roller skates in 1998.
In the year to March 1996, Salomon made a net attributable profit of 308 million francs against 161 million last year.

Firstly, the group wanted to answer the international needs of its clients. This is mainly done through the Global One joint venture with Deutsche Telekom and Sprint Corp of the United States.
Secondly, the group wants to use its know-how in building modern infrastructure networks and is setting up such networks in Latin America and Indonesia.
Thirdly, the group is looking for ""new growth areas"" to compensate for the impact on sales of the new competition in France, Bon said.
Mobistar, in which France Telecom has a majority stake, is part of this policy. The Beglian operator started six weeks ago and has 20,000 subscribers, aiming for a 25 percent market share in 2005.
France Telecom hopes to hear in November that a consortium it leads has won a GSM licence in Romania and the group is in negotiations with the government of Poland.
In Poland, France Telecom is operator of an analogue network but was excluded from getting a GSM digital licence. After a state visit by French President Jacques Chirac, the situation has improved for France Telecom, but negotiations are still continuing.
In Italy, France Telecom has no ambitions in mobile telecommunications, because of the presence of state-owned TIM Omnitel, which is run by Olivetti.
France Telecom is talking with Olivetti about co-operating in Infostrada, a fixed-line venture which is bidding for the network of the Italian railways.

1369,"French computer maker Cie des Machines Bull now has the freedom to deal with any other computer group in Europe following the sale of some five percent of its shares held by the government.
Thierry Breton, managing director of Bull, told Reuters in a telephone interview that the company still planned to be part of a restructuring of the European computer industry.
""With the support of our private shareholders, we can do that either by a market operation, by a merger or acquisition or by both,"" he said.  
""Rather than to wait for when the opportunity presented itself before doing anything, the shareholders decided to put us in a position so that we can act as a private company when the time is ripe.""
Breton said others involved in the restructuring of the European computer industry included Italy's Olivetti, Philips Electronics of the Netherlands and Siemens AG of Germany.
""There are also the European units of U.S. companies that may be interested in participating in the restructuring,"" he added.  
Jean-Marie Descarpentries, the former McKinsey consultant who became chairman in 1993, earlier this year said Bull wanted the state to sell 20 percent to a fourth industrial partner, preferably European, and to financial investors.
Bull returned to profit in 1995 after posting combined losses of 22 billion francs since 1990.
The French government has said it plans to privatise Bull before the end of 1997.
Breton said the state share sale would take place after a capital increase amounting to ""several hundreds of millions of francs.""  
The state will subscribe to its portion of the capital increase, but resell its shares to private investors.
Motorola of the U.S., NEC of Japan and France Telecom, which each have a 17 percent stake, are expected to subscribe to their part.
""They are on our strategic commission. They come here every three months for two days. I think I can say that we have the support of our shareholders,"" Breton said.
IBM, which has 1.6 percent, is not expected to join in the capital increase. It has passed up two previous opportunities.  
Japan's Dai Nippon Printing, with 3.3 percent, has been invited to join the capital increase.
Bull in February effectively withdrew from the personal computer market by merging its Zenith Data division with Packard Bell Electronics Inc.
Breton said the company was standing by its profit forecast of higher profits in 1996 compared with a 306 million profit in 1995, but he declined to confirm the group was aiming for more than 600 million.
""We keep our forecast, we are on line to deliver on our promise,"" Breton said.

1371,"Cie Generale des Eaux on Tuesday launched its bid to become the main rival to state-owned France Telecom with the start a fixed telephone network in a residential quarter in the southern city of Nice.
Philippe Glotin, managing director of Generale's telecoms unit Cegetel, said the group aims to have a market share in 2003 yielding 40 billion francs ($7.9 billion) in annual sales, of which more than half would come from mobile communications.
In mobile telecommunications, Generale already competes with France Telecom with its SFR unit and it is allied to British Telecom Plc and MCI for business services.
The local residential market is expected to grow at a moderate pace but nevertheless represent 55 billion francs in 2003.
Glotin said he aimed at gaining a 40 percent share in mobiles, 20 percent in long-distance and 10 percent for so-called local loops, or small networks.
Cegetel, which counts BT, Mannesmann and SBC of the United States among its owners, has received permission from the French authorities for a telecoms experiment in Nice and from the start of 1997 it will offer residential telecoms services, using the DECT technology.
DECT, digitally-enhanced cordless telephone, uses radio waves to connect buildings to a telephone switch, while the connections inside the building are of the classical type using a telephone socket.
DECT is also available in totally wireless versions but the Nice experiment will not use this. DECT can handle high capacities and is relatively secure as far as privacy of calls is concerned.
Glotin said that Nice was the precursor of Cegetel's assault on France Telecom and the company would invest three billion francs in Nice and somewhere in central France to hone its skills ahead of the liberalisation of the market in 1998.
Cegetel is aiming to start its business in some 30 towns which will add up to a population of some 10 million inhabitants.
To part finance this five-year plan, Cegetel shareholders will inject 6.8 billion francs into the company at the start of 1997.
In business services, Cegetel is considering putting a local loop in the La Defense office complex on the Paris outskirts -- where parent Generale des Eaux is the main building developer.
In that area, MFS Communications Ltd already offers business services with a local loop in competition to France Telecom.
Glotin said that the success of Cegetel, or any other rival to France Telecom in France, depended to a large extent on the interconnection costs and other payments telecom operators have to make to France Telecom to use its installations.
Telecommunications minister Francois Fillon has started a wide consultation, set to end on November 30, in order to establish in early 1997 a price list of the services France Telecom can provide to its rivals.
""The level of the interconnection costs for us means either the right to live of the right to die,"" Glotin said.
Other future rivals for France Telecom are building and communications group Bouygues which has teamed up with Italy's STET. Bouygues started France's third mobile telecommunications service earlier this year.
AT&amp;T has also expressed a desire to become a major force in the France market. ($ = 5.080 French Francs)
",MarcelMichelson,1
1374,"French diversified conglomerate Bouygues on Thursday said Italy's STET was joining its efforts to become a leading player in France's telecommunications market after full liberalisation of the sector in 1998.
Bouygues, active in construction, television and communication, said STET would take a 49 percent stake in a new joint venture with Bouygues, called Bouygues-STET, in which the French group would hold 51 percent.
This company, together with German partner VEBA, plans to bid to run the telephone infrastructure of French state railways group SNCF.
Bouygues will compete in French telecommunications with state-owned France Telecom, of which a 20 percent stake will be floated in April, and with CEGETEL the telecoms company majority owned by Generale des Eaux.
STET will also buy into the BDT holding company which is 51-percent owner of Bouygues Telecom. Bouygues said that BDT was valued at 13.75 billion francs and STET would during 1996 and 1997 pay 1.71 billion francs to buy new shares in BDT.
After this increase, Bouygues will have 59.5 percent of BDT, Jean-Claude Decaux International 20.9 percent and STET 19.6 percent.
VEBA has a 15 percent direct stake in Bouygues Telecom. Other stake holders are Cable &amp; Wireless Plc, US West International and banks BNP and Paribas.
Last month, Generale des Eaux said it was forming a telecoms unit CEGETEL with British Telecommunications Plc, SBC of the United States and Mannesman AG of Germany.
Analysts have said they are also awaiting a move by AT&amp;T on the French market.
France Telecom has Deutsche Telekom and Sprint Corp as partners.
Bouygues in May started France's third mobile telecommuncitions network, aiming at a 20 percent market share in the year 2000.
The activity in the French telecommunications sector are similar to alliances forming in Germany.
British Telecom Plc is allied to German utility Viag AG. On Wednesday, RWE dropped their company from an alliance with Veba and Cable and Wireless.

1379,"The 1,400 staff of ailing French regional airline Air Liberte, which is under bankruptcy protection, published a full-page newspaper advert on Sunday demanding that they be shown takeover bids made to the administrators.
""How is it possible that a company which has been fighting with success for eight years to improve the quality of air transport could disappear today,"" staff said in an ""open letter"" advert in the Journal du Dimanche main French Sunday paper.
British Airways Plc, Richard Branson's Brussels-based Virgin Express, a consortium headed by Nouvelles Frontieres chairman Jacques Maillot, and commercial pilot Fernand Denan have made offers for Air Liberte.
The commercial court of Creteil, a southeastern Paris suburb, is expected to decide early this week which of the options will be pursued. Air Liberte went into administration on September 26 with debts of about 1.5 billion francs.
In an ad paid for by the airline's works council, staff of Air Liberte blamed the French authorities for much of the companies' woes.
""By multiplying the obstacles to its development -- difficulties to obtain slots, difficulties to get ground handling services equal to those of the state airline (Air France /Air Inter ) -- the public authorities have pushed Air Liberte into a dead-end,"" the advert read.
They also blamed certain Air Liberte shareholders for ""abandoning"" the company at the eve of a recapitalisation and said they feared the final solution would be liquidation.
""We staff of Air Liberte, we cannot accept anymore to lose our jobs, put our families in distress nor to interrupt the service we have to give to passengers,"" the advert said.
The ad said the staff wanted to see the bids made for the company and were ready to take on responsibilities.
Ousted chairman and founder Lotfi Belhassine had been preparing a last-minute capital increase in which staff would put six weeks' pay into the company.
""Today, some people seem to wish the liquidation of Air Liberte rather than the arrival of a European company. Who has interest in seeing the return of a monopoly?,"" the ad asked.
British Airways plans to pay 25 million francs for Air Liberte and aims to merge it with its French TAT unit. The British airline said on Friday it had plans to spend 440 million francs on getting Air Liberte back into profit in three years.
Air Liberte owns about a quarter of the landing and take-off slots at Orly airport, Paris' second airport specialising in domestic flights, and this would dramatically boost BA's presence and competitiveness in France.
Air Liberte lost 650 million francs in the first nine months of 1996 due to an air fare war and insufficient passenger numbers. Since the start of the year the main French domestic routes are open to competition ahead of full liberalistaion in 1997. Air Liberte and other regional group AOM have been fighting to take market share from former monopolist Air Inter.
Jacques Maillot, also chairman of smaller airline Corsair, counts the Rivaud bank, travel group Club Mediterranee and Royal Air Maroc in his consortium.
Maillot has not given financial details but he plans to merge Air Liberte with AOM, which is for sale.
The Rivaud bank, a very secretive and influential financial group, is headed since last week by entrepreneur Vincent Bollore and the bank is close to the ruling RPR party.
The Le Monde newspaper said last week Prime Minister Alain Juppe was pushing for a domestic buyer for Air Liberte.

1382,"Market talk persists about a possible demerger of Rhone-Poulenc into a chemicals company and a pharmaceuticals group, with a leading French broker saying it would boost share value by a third.
""Intrinsically, Rhone-Poulenc is worth no more than 40 to 45 billion francs ($7.89 billion to $8.88 billion) due to the weight of underperforming chemical activities and their important debts,"" Jean Borjeix, chief analyst at Jean-Pierre Pinatton, wrote recently.
He said that if the pharmaceutical activities -- Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, Fisons, Merieux and Connaught -- were separated from the chemical activities, total group value could be 60 billion francs.
""An asset gain of such a size would allow (an investor) to wait until the (demerger) operation takes place,"" Borjeix said, adding that the 1996 and 1997 results forecasts limited the downside.
Pinatton expects Rhone-Poulenc to report a stable 1996 net attributable profit of 2.05 billion francs, rising to 2.5 billion in 1997. Rhone published a net attributable profit of 2.13 billion in 1995.
Demerger rumours were first fuelled by May 28 comments by managing director Igor Landau, during a luncheon at the Roland Garros tennis tournament, saying the company had studied the possibility but had, for the time being, decided against it.
Borjeix believes the company will decide to split because management has become concerned about share holder value and also because an asset disposal policy is coming to an end.
Other analysts are less sure.
""I don't think it will happen. They will concentrate on improving margins themselves for the time being,"" said an analyst at a U.S. brokerage in London.
He also dismissed a suggestion, aired in Business Week in June, of Rhone selling its 68 percent stake in Rhone-Poulenc Rorer. ""There would be no immediate benefit to that.""
Rhone shares have been rising recently, partly on the back of 9.2 percent higher first half profits and on recurring speculative rumours of a split or possible merger of the chemical activities with Atochem of Elf-Aquitaine.
Shares rose from 122.3 francs in May to 136 on June 18 on initial speculation and then fell back to 120.8 on July 24. They have resumed their rise to 131 francs, but this is still below the institutional privatisation price of 146 francs in November 1993 and a price for individuals of 135 francs.
Les Echos newspaper said on July 29 that the company's board meeting of July, where the first half profit figures were approved, had also discussed the group's vulnerability to a takeover bid.
The paper said chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou was worried the insufficent profitability of the chemical sector would make the group a cheap buy for a rival.
Fourtou has made the restructuring of the chemical sector a key part of his strategy, next to a pharmaceutical expansion drive and a 10-billion-franc two-year asset sale plan.
Board member Philippe Desmarescaux was recently given control of the chemicals sector in a move which was seen as signalling that restructuring of the division would accelerate.
Rhone-Poulenc took 223 million francs in provisions for the chemicals sector in the first half and expects total 1996 group provisions to be 500 million francs.
The rumours about a chemical link-up with Elf-Aquitaine are in line with many market stories about big French combinations to stave off competition in world markets -- the same reasoning caused rumours Elf would merge with Total SA.
At Elf, where chairman Philippe Jaffre is also trying to boost profitability with cost cuts and asset sales, the Atochem unit is doing fine, even though sales fell in the first half.
Jacques Puechal, the pipe-smoking chairman of the division, has embarked on a selective acquisition policy bolstered by a surge in 1995 net attributable profit of five billion francs, against 1.8 billion in the previous year.
On Wednesday, Paris broker Leven SA issued a ""speculative buy"" advice on Rhone Poulenc shares, after having been ""neutral"". Leven said the company's debt remained a worry but it appreciated developments in the drugs division and noted rumours of a demerger. ($1=5.068 French Franc)

1384,"South Korea's Daewoo Electronics on Thursday defended a proposed controversial deal to buy France's Thomson Multimedia by pledging to make investments in the company.
The head of Daewoo Electronics and the founder of its parent company tried to allay French fears through interviews in two leading French newspapers, promising hefty investment and a long term commitment to the country.
The chairman of Daewoo Electronics, Bae Soon-hoon, was trying to counter criticism about a South Korean company acquiring leading-edge French digital television technology cheaply. He said his company would spend at least 10 billion french francs ($1.9 billion) on TMM.
French Finance Minister Jean Arthuis meanwhile reaffirmed that the government was set on selling defence and consumer electronics group Thomson SA to Lagardere Groupe and Daewoo even if Prime Minister Juppe wanted a public debate on the sale of the state group.
Juppe told parliament on Tuesday he would call a debate on the sale, for one symbolic franc, after an 11 billion franc ($2.2 billion) capital injection, in reaction to a public outcry and criticism from opposition parties and also from within his own coalition.
Arthuis dismissed criticism on the government's decision to sell the company by way of a private placement instead of a public sale.
""This is a company that could not be privatised through a public offer,"" Arthuis told reporters at a press briefing on Thursday. ""How could we ask several investors to bid on a company with a negative net value.""
Thomson has debts of some 14 billion francs.
Lagardere wants to merge Thomson SA's 58-percent-owned and profitable defence group Thomson-CSF with its Matra unit and sell loss-making consumer electronics group Thomson Multimedia (TMM) to Daewoo Electronics.
The state's Privatisation Commission is currently studying both the preferred bid by Lagardere/Daewoo and one by Alcatel Alsthom and is expected to give its opinion in early December.
The chairman of Daewoo Electronics said his company would spend at least 10 billion francs on TMM in an effort to still the rising criticism about the deal.
""In total, the immediate cost of acquisition and recapitalisation of Thomson Multimedia for Daewoo is some 10 billion francs. But these 10 billion are only a first stage,"" Bae Soon-hoon told the La Tribune Desfosses newspaper, breaking his self-imposed silence on Daewoo's bid details.
He said South Korea and France had increasingly direct links, adding that French companies had sold the TGV high-speed train and nuclear power stations to his country and were planning to sell battle planes and other weapons.
France's trade minister Yves Galland is due to travel to South Korea on Monday to promote the country's economic interests during a trip lasting until Thursday.
France hopes to sell Dassault Rafale combat planes to South Korea to monitor its northern Communist neighbour.
Kim Woo-choong, chairman and founder of the Daewoo conglomerate, told France's Liberation newspaper in Seoul that big Japanese companies would want to see the Thomson deal fail.
""Certain big international electronics companies are against ths deal because they believe that the merger would make Daewoo too competitive,"" Woo-choong said, adding, ""These big companies are perhaps busy lobbying the French government.""
Liberation said he referred to Japanese companies.
""The French government cannot come back on its decision if there is not an important reason to do so,"" Woo-choong said.

But the companies did not confirm a newspaper report they were seeking approval for a five-year plan to cut 40,000 jobs in an early retirement scheme in exchange for hiring 14,000 young people. Newspaper Les Echos said the cost of these operations could be 30 billion francs ($6 billion).
""Our chairman Louis Schweitzer and Peugeot chairman Jacques Calvet have written a letter to Prime Minister Alain Juppe in July with a proposal,"" a Renault spokeswoman said.
""There have been discussions since but the government has not yet replied,"" she added.
At Peugeot, officials declined to comment on the existence of the letter but a spokesman said that the French car industry needed to rejuvenate its work force.
""In France, the average age of a car worker is 42 to 43 years but our competitors, especially Asian, have an average age of below 30 years,"" the Peugeot spokesman said.
He said that this gave Peugeot and Renault a competitive handicap at a time when the markets are increasingly being opened up -- from 1999 a quota system limiting Japanese car imports in Europe will be lifted.
Younger workers are not only cheaper but also more flexible and open to new techniques such as ""empowerment"" - a management idea giving workers more responsibility for their own work, the Peugeot official said.
At Renault the average age is 45 years. ""We have old factories, the oldest is at Flins which dates from the war, and therefore the average age is rather high,"" the Renault spokeswoman said.
Renault had a worldwide staff of 139,950 people at the end of 1995. Of them, 72,163 were involved in car production in France.
At PSA Peugeot Citroen, the group number is 139,900 of whom 122,600 are in car production in France.
French car makers are experiencing difficulties and a two-year government old-for-new car incentive scheme has not helped to overcome market problems.
The French auto industry is hit by increased competition from Asian rivals as well as by the strength of the franc.
Renault expects to end 1995 in the red after posting a net attributable profit of 2.1 billion francs in 1995 while Peugeot reported a drop in first half net attributable profits to 602 million francs against 1.22 billion last year.
Renault is cutting 1,650 jobs in 1996 through early retirement and partial early retirement schemes and will in January start negotiations with its labour unions about the 1997 restructuring plan.
At Peugeot, there is a reduction of 3,000 to 4,000 in the job numbers each year and there too, new negotiations are due to start early 1997.
""French carmakers have a record of trying to adapt to the market conditions without resorting to mass lay-offs, like for instance our German neighbours have done,"" the spokesman said.

Workers of the state-owned company came in busloads to Paris to demonstrate in front of the group's headquarters in the centre of the capital before heading to the parliament buildings. There were also protest marches in Rennes, Bordeaux, Nice and Grenoble.
Thomson staff are angry that they have not been involved in the decision and say they do not understand the economic logic behind it.
""The sale of Thomson Multimedia to the Korean group Daewoo is unacceptable,"" said a protesting Thomson worker in Rennes, the capital of the western Britanny region where police said 1,200 people marched.
""This company is running fine and makes top quality products, we do not want to make low quality products,"" he added.
In Grenoble in the east about a thousand people marched, some shouting ""Daewoo, mechant loup"" (Daewoo, big bad wolf).
Industry Minister Franck Borotra told parliament during question time that privatisation was the only way to secure the future of Thomson Multimedia.
""This company is in a situation of a serious financial disaster,"" he said about the loss-making and indebted French state-owned group.
Workers, however, maintain the company is fundamentally profitable.
""Thomson is sold for one franc and the buyers will hit a 20 billion franc jackpot,"" said a slogan carried in the Rennes march.
The French government said last month it planned the sell the Thomson SA group to Lagardere Groupe for one franc after an 11 billion franc ($2.17 billion) capital injection.
Lagardere will keep Thomson SA's 58 percent stake in defence electronics group Thomson-CSF and sell television set and video recorder maker Thomson Multimedia to Daewoo Electronics, also for one franc.
France's Privatisation Commission and the European Commission still have to approve the deal.
""What we want is a halt to the privatisation procedure and the start of serious discussions about the future of the electronics industry in this country,"" a labour union spokesman told France 2 television.

1401,"The Czech government on Tuesday approved the text of a long-awaited declaration on post-World War Two reconciliation with Germany, paving the way for its initialling on Friday.
The declaration, leaked to news media last week, contains mutual expressions of regret for the Nazi occupation from 1938 to 1945 and for excessive brutality during the post-war expulsion of ethnic Germans from the Sudetenland region of what was then Czechoslovakia.
Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus told reporters after a weekly government meeting that he had been authorised to sign the text, which took two years to negotiate, without changes.
""The government has closed the debate by this text and it sees no chance, opportunity or reason to make any changes to it...Negotiation on the text has ended for us, I'm saying that unambiguously,"" Klaus said.
The foreign ministers of the two countries are now due to initial the text in the Czech capital on Friday. Signature by the two presidents and confirmation by the parliaments are expected early next year.
""In this declaration it is clearly stated that the will of both sides is to close the past, to close the negative chapters of our history. This declaration means a clear turn in our relations toward the future,"" Klaus said.
The text has angered groups representing families of the Sudeten Germans, who complained that it did not compensate for property lost during the expulsions.
Germany's Christian Social Union (CSU), the political sponsor of the expelled Germans which has in the past hinted it might use its weight in the Bonn government to block the declaration, has given qualified support to the text.
But on Tuesday the CSU government of Bavaria, home of most expellees, made a number of demands.
It said it could accept the declaration only if both Bavaria and the official Sudeten German representatives were allowed to participate in a planned fund for German-Czech projects.
And it picked up a key condition which Prague has so far rejected, saying that it expected a commitment, ""no later than when the declaration is signed, that the Czech side will hold talks with the representatives of the Sudeten German community"".
In the Czech parliament the mainstream parties have backed the declaration, but the extreme-right Republican Party and far-left Communists have ruled out voting for it in any form.
Members of the largest Czech opposition party, the Social Democrats, whose votes may be crucial for approval by parliament, have said they still had concerns about vague wording on compensation for victims of Nazi aggression.
The declaration sets up a Czech-German Future Fund with the German side paying in 140 million marks ($90 million) and the Czechs paying about one-seventh of that to finance ""projects of common interest"" including joint environmental, historical and scientific projects and youth meetings.
But the text adds: ""The German side acknowledges its obligation of responsibility to all who became victims of National Socialist violence. That is why the projects, wherever appropriate, should work mainly for the benefit of the victims of National Socialist violence.""

CEZ's Director of Planning and Analysis section Petr Voboril told a news conference that higher depreciation write-offs due to the opening of new installations cut the company's tax obligations, and boosting its bottom line.
The company's gross profit for the period remained flat at 13.1 billion.
Czech accounting put the firm's profit for the first nine months at 7.04 billion, up from 6.7 billion last year.
CEZ said the result did not change the firm's profit forecast under Czech standards for the whole year, which is 8.1 billion crowns, equal to last year's.
A financial statement showed CEZ wrote off 4.1 billion in the first nine months compared with 3.4 billion in the same period of 1995, and paid 4.7 billion in income tax after 5.7 billion last year.
""Above all, lowering of tax obligations in connection with depriciation policy have influenced this (profit) increase,"" Voboril said.
He said that overall demand for electricity rose by 5.5 percent in the period, and is expected to reach a record high of 55.3 terrawatthours, 6.1 percent up year-on-year, for the whole 1996.
Household consumption drove the increase, rising 10.5 percent, while large clients demanded almost two percent more power over the same period of the last year.
Voboril said that a recent ruling by the Finance Minstry on maximum prices CEZ can charge regional power distributors did not effect results thanks to the sales increase.
The ministry decided that the maximum average price CEZ can charge for supplies this year is 1,035 crowns per megawatthour, up two crowns from the last year but below the firm's 1,040 crown expectation included in business plan.
Voboril said that short-term indebtedness of CEZ increased as well as financial expenditures due to unpaid debts from some of the eight regional distributors, which totalled 3.2 billion crowns as of September 30.
CEZ and six of the country's eight regional grid operators had been locked in a price dispute with CEZ until the ministry ruling last month.
CEZ is also considering an international bond issue next year as it needs financing but has already flooded the domestic market with paper, Voboril said.
Local analysts welcomed the results but said they did not expect them to help CEZ's share price much as the Prague Stock Exchange is plagued by a lack of confidence.
""The CEZ results are slightly better than I expected. CEZ is fundamentally undervalued but genereal market sentiment is not very strong,"" said Petr Dousa of Zivnostenska Banka. ""I don't expect the price to go up to 1,000 in the next few days.""

1404,"Czech National Bank (CNB) Governor Josef Tosovsky said on Friday that there was no need to hurry the privatisation of shares in the largest commercial bank, Komercni Banka a.s. .
He said when the time comes to sell the state's roughly 49 percent in Komercni, it is possible the stake could be divided for sale to several investors.
""There is not a need to hurry with (Komercni's) privatisation. A strategic partner is not necessary, so it is possible to propose to sell the state stake to more investors,"" Tosovsky said after a closed meeting of the parliament's banking commission.
But he added the central bank does not yet have a strong concensus on what to do with Komercni's shares.
""We haven't an absolutely firm opinion on this, it's possible (to sell) to both domestic and foreign investors.""
The central bank has submitted a broad plan to privatise shares in the so-called ""Big Four"" banks which calls for the merger of trade bank Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka a.s. with Ceska Sporitlena a.s. , the largest savings bank.
The CNB has said it would prefer to wait several years before privatising the state shares after the newly-merged bank is established to analyse effects of the merger.
""CSOB is ready for quite a fast privatisation, but when considered in a wider scope, we (the CNB) think that a merger with Ceska Sporitelna would be more suitable,"" Tosovsky said.
""If this proposal is accepted, privatisation would be... delayed, beause there must be the merger first.""
The Czech cabinet must approve any privatisation of shares in the Big Four banks, and this week they asked the central bank for more concrete details on the central bank's plan.
""(A merger of CSOB and Sporitelna) has a number of rational and economic reasons,"" Tosovsky said without elaborating.
The governor rejected comments by CSOB and Sporitelna executives who reacted coolly to the merger plan.
""The managements are not the owners... it's logical the managements have their own interests and preferences, but the owner is the (state National Property Fund),"" he said.
He said Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus had requested details to the central bank's plan for a quick sale of the state's 31.5 percent of Investicni a Postovni Banka a.s. to a strategic foreign partner.
""The prime minister proposed (for the CNB) to make concrete some procedings concerning mostly IPB so that the privatisation can start as soon as possible,"" Tosovsky said.
IPB executives have confirmed that both Japan's Normura and Dutch ING Bank NV have shown an interest in acquiring shares in IPB.
Klaus has said he is not in favour of the CSOB/Sporitelna merger, equating it with melding Prague's two top soccer teams Sparta and Slavia, an idea unthinkable for most Czechs.

1407,"Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, in his dual role as economics professor, said on Monday the large Czech foreign trade deficit came from a temporary investment wave, and he forecast a perpetual, but smaller trade gap.
Lecturing a packed assembly hall at the Prague School of Economics, Klaus, a freshly-accredited professor of economics, said the record 110.7 billion crown trade deficit in the first nine months of this year was ""not tragic"".
""It would be correct to discuss the current account, or the whole payment balance, and not just the trade balance... due to a number of structural phenomena,"" Klaus said.
""The Czech Republic will probably not have a positive trade balance in the long term, ever,"" he added.
Klaus said the current trade deficit was ""the temporary above-average rate of investment.""
He said the investment boom would ease, leading to a narrowing in the differential with savings, but a lack of natural resources, the structure of the Czech economy, and its geographical position would perpetuate a trade deficit.
In the first nine months of this year, imports rose by a nominal 15.2 percent, year-on-year, to 551.2 billion crowns, while exports climbed 5.9 percent to 440.5 percent.
The Czech Statistical Bureau forecast last week that the foreign trade deficit would reach 163.3 billion crowns for the whole of 1996, up from about 95.7 billion crowns last year.
The current account deficit stood at 46.7 billion crowns, or 6.9 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in the first half, and the CSU foreacsts it to reach 6.9 percent of GDP for the whole of 1996, and 6.8-7.4 percent of GDP next year.
Klaus repeated his long-held objection to a devaluation of the Czech crown, saying it would not help much as exports ""are not a straight function of the exchange rate"".
He also criticised export lobbyists' calls for an import surcharge and higher tariffs, and blasted moves to ""Buy Czech"", saying each country should use its comparative advantages in production and cannot make everything itself.
Klaus said his government's aim was to stop an acceleration in the deficit, and then to start lowering it. He said the increase could be stopped by the beginning of 1998.
There is no theory on what is the maximum-bearable deficit of the current account, as a percentage of GDP, Klaus said.
He said that the Czech Republic had more than sufficient foreign exchange reserves cover the gap. The Czech central bank said official reserves totalled roughly $13 billion at the end of August, with gross banking-sector reserves at $16.6 billion.
Answering a student's question on export structure, Klaus said that exports of high-added-value goods would help the overall trade balance, but such technology would take time to develop.
""How high can you jump? One metre thirty? It would be better if you could jump one-eighty.... But you can't do that straight away, you need to train it,"" Klaus said.
With practise ""maybe you'll get to some 140 centimetres in a year's time,"" he said.

1410,"Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus accused opposition Social Democrat leader Milos Zeman of lying and losing his nerve as neck-and-neck campaigning for weekend Senate elections turned increasingly bitter.
Zeman made a thinly-veiled allegation that the BIS intelligence agency had tried to extract compromising material from his elderly mother.
The slanging match between the two leading antagonists of Czech politics began on Monday when BIS director Stanislav Devaty, a Klaus protege, was forced to quit over allegations of spying on a deputy prime minister and a subsequent coverup.
""Yesterday's comments by Zeman on a police state, or on the BIS as a political police in the service of one party, are a visible result of losing his nerve before the elections,"" Klaus told a news conference.
""I can imagine such words being said by a radical anarchist but I can't imagine them from one of the three highest constitutional officials of this country.""
On Monday Zeman, who is lower house speaker, accused Klaus of playing dirty before the Senate elections, where the Social Democrats have been running level with the ruling Civic Democratic Party (ODS) in most opinion polls.
""The political struggle should be a struggle of arguments and not an abuse of secret services for spying on political opponents,"" he said.
""During the last three years an operational group has existed within the BIS which has been responsible for shadowing several Social Democrat politicians,"" said Zeman.
Spymaster Devaty quit after Deputy Prime Minister Josef Lux, who leads the junior Christian Democrats in Klaus's coalition, accused the BIS of spying on him three years ago.
The BIS had covered up the operation by failing to report it to the cabinet and a parliamentary commission supervising the agency.
Klaus said the agent had been spying not on Lux, who is also agriculture minister, but on a former adviser of his who was director of a bank which collapsed amidst fraud allegations in 1993. He has not explained why the state security service was investigating an apparent fraud case.
Devaty was a member of Klaus's ODS, although he had suspended his membership to become BIS chief.
Allegations of politically-inspired spying on both government and opposition politicians have surfaced regularly in recent years in a country where memories remain of the pervasive state security apparatus before communism fell in 1989.
The political temperature soared on Tuesday when Zeman said his 79-year-old mother had been visited by ""certain people"" trying to acquire compromising information.
Asked about this comment, Klaus said: ""If this actually represents what he said then this is such an unbelievable lie that I couldn't bring myself to reply at all. It's pure lie.""
Klaus accused Zeman of running a negative campaign.
""Instead of programmes there are scandals and affairs which destabilise the state and damage our country abroad,"" he said.
""The BIS affair is a clear evidence that above all the (Social Democrats) lack, in contrast to the ODS, a positive programme.""

1411,"The three-party Czech coalition cabinet on Wednesday agreed to quickly find a new director for the country's secret service following the resignation of its former chief amid a pre-election political spying row.
Prime Minster Vaclav Klaus, head of the senior coalition Civic Democratic Party (ODS), told a news conference that each coalition party had been asked to propose a candidate acceptable for all parties to lead the BIS ""as soon as possible"".
Acting-director Stanislav Devaty resigned on Monday after the head of junior coalition partner, Christian Democratic Union (KDU-CSL) Josef Lux accused the BIS last Friday of spying on him three years ago and then covering it up.
He requested Devaty's dismissal along with the right-wing Civic Demopcratic Alliance (ODA), the other coalition member which had already made similar claims last year.
The government charged Devaty's deputy, Jaroslav Jiru, to lead the BIS until a new director is named, Klaus said.
The affair hotted up just a week before Senate elections, a key test of Klaus's government which lost its majority in the lower house of parliament in June elections.
The Senate has only limited powers but analysts say the outcome of the polls will be a significant indicator for the future of Klaus's centre-right cabinet. The allegations within the coalition were potentially damaging ahead of the vote.
Klaus said the ministers were also asked to consider how to tighten control over BIS.
Analysts say if Klaus's party fares well in the elections, his government's position may be eased. But he might find it hard to stay in office if his position is weak in both houses.
Klaus said ministers were disturbed by opposition Social Democrat chairman of parliament Milos Zeman who had suggested the Interior Ministry had joined the BIS in creating ""political police"" groups shadowing politicians.
""All members of the cabinet expressed their irritation from the statements of the second constitutional official of this country, by which he in fact threw in doubt the credibility of the constitution system of the Czech Republic,"" Klaus said.
President Vaclav Havel has called Zeman's statements ""extremely irresponsible"" and said the opposition leader should go through formal channels he has proof of his accusations.

1413,"Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus announced a state commission on Wednesday to attack bureaucracy in the land of Franz Kafka.
It will have a steering committee, a chairman, two vice-chairmen, two sections, six sub-commissions and more members than Klaus's cabinet.
But Klaus denied suggestions that the new ""Commission for the Removal of Bureaucratic Burden"" would pour fuel on to the fire, telling a news conference that the only bureaucrat working at the commission would be a secretary.
The other staff, numbering around 20, would perform their duties part time, said Klaus, whose cabinet has 16 members.
The Czech bureaucracy, crafted by the Austro-Hungarian empire and perfected under communism, inflicts daily misery on local and foreign residents alike.
Franz Kafka, the Prague novellist of the early 20th century, wrote of angst born of bureaucracy in such works as ""The Trial"" and ""The Castle"".
Things today do not seem much better. Applications for documents such as company registrations, licences and work permits can take weeks or months to process.
They can involve repeated visits to offices where citizens have to queue patiently sometimes for hours waiting to be summoned by often surly bureaucrats. Knocking on office doors for attention is strictly forbidden.
Klaus said the commission should aim to simplify issues like setting up a business, getting construction permits or social benefits, or dealing with tax offices.
Chairman Vladimir Budinsky, a former transport minister, indicated he was confident his commission would not gain the Czech bureaucrat's reputation for idleness.
""I believe that we will be able to find people for each section who would be ready to work,"" he said.

1418,"Czech National Bank (CNB) Governor Josef Tosovsky on Friday said the central bank was committed to keeping the crown strong, despite some calls to depreciate the currency to help exports.
Speaking after a meeting with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and top business executives, Tosovsky said the central bank would keep the crown within the current band against which it fixes the currency daily versus a mark/dollar basket.
""I said that we will try to keep the rate within the plus/minus 7.5 percent band (against the mark/dollar cross rate),"" Tosovsky told reporters.
""I dismissed speculation that we would want to move the crown in some way outside the band,"" he added.
Analysts recently have been debating whether a devaluation of the crown might be needed to boost exports and help stem a ballooning current account deficit.
The trade deficit is threatening to send the current account shortfall to close to six percent of gross domestic product this year after about four percent last year.
Some have argued that a devaluation is required to help the country's goods remain competitive while wages are rising and the economy is transforming.
But others have said that the foreign capital inflow is l comfortably paying for the imports, and the current account deficit is not dangerous.
Tosovsky said a stable crown had served its purpose in regulating inflation, and a stronger crown would have positive effects on reforming Czech industry to make it more competitive.
He said a stronger crown ""should help faster restructuring of our economy, to help increase the added-value faster...and to help to bring our country closer in productivity to the countries that we want to compare ourselves with.""
The central bank fixes the crown daily within a band plus or minus 7.5 percent from the central parity of the mark/crown basket.
It has been fixing it recently at more than three percent above parity to match a modest net inflow from foreign crown buying.
After the meeting, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said the government would aim to provide more funds to export promotion agencies such as the Czech Export Bank, and its sister export insurance agency.
He said he had told business leaders it was necessary to lower their expectations of higher inflation because it had become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
""We cannot automatically appease the expectation of, let's say, nine percent inflation, and make that the basis for all further expenditure -- price and wage items,"" Klaus said.
He said this would be key to the government's position in collective bargaining. ""We have to radically break this (inflation expectation). This must be the basis of this year's debates on collective agreements.""

1423,"A reporter's call to the new director's secretary at a major Czech industrial company went something like this:
Journalist: ""Could you please tell me Mr. Novak's first name.""
Secretary (with no hesitation): ""Doctor.""
Czechs are obsessed with academic titles.
It was Justice Minister Jan Kalvoda's use of an unattained ""Doctor of Law"" which forced him to resign from cabinet on Tuesday in a shocking mea culpa on the floor of parliament.
""In this society having a title plays such a role -- whether or not you have a degree,"" Jiri Pehe, the head of research at Prague's Open Media Research Institute, said.
Normal discussions in many offices begin with colleagues addressing each other as ""Mr. Engineer"" -- a title of mid-level academic specialisation -- or ""Mr. Doctor"", held by many Czechs from physicians to lawyers to PhD'd journalists.
Kalvoda was once a practicing lawyer who did complete law school but did not finish the certification process required to become a doctor of law. His colleagues and his party began using the title in literature, and he never refuted it.
His resignation came on top of the confessions of four other deputies in the lower house of parliament who also used the unauthorised ""JUDr"" moniker in campaign material and biographies.
Apart from Kalvoda, only one resigned from parliament, the three others so far have refused.
""I suspect that there may be a few more deputies or government officials in some positions who are claiming to have degrees which they in fact do not have,"" said Pehe, a PhD who did not insist on the use of ""Dr."" for this story.
The Czech prime minister, a highly-educated economist, has the full academic title -- Professor Engineer Vaclav Klaus CSc (Candidate of Science, a former regional variation of PhD) -- but he does not inisist on its use by others.
Some of title-envy stems from four decades of communism which ended with 1989's bloodless ""Velvet Revolution"" led by a band of intellectuals and the dissident playwright Vaclav Havel.
Communist leaders insisted on an educated population, at least quantitatively, and even implemented programmes producing fast-brewed PhD's and engineers at colleges.
Kalvoda's resignation inspired commentaries on the subject of academic titles in Wednesday newspapers.
The daily Mlada Fronta Dnes quoted an unnamed cabinet member as saying the only minister safe from title-fixing accusations was Interior Minister Jan Ruml - a former dissident who the communists would never allow to attend college.
The daily Lidove Noviny used the Kalvoda incident to pay tribute to Havel, who became the country's president after the 1989 revolution.
Havel, as a dissident, was forced by the communists to work in manual jobs and never was allowed to study for a formal degree. He now has a truckload of honorary doctorates from universities worldwide.
""He made himself a name, not a title,"" Lidove Noviny wrote.

1425,"Disgruntled Czech opposition Social Democrats have blamed party chairman Milos Zeman for their poor showing in weekend elections for the country's new Senate.
They suggested that charges by Zeman ahead of the elections that intelligence agents had harassed himself and his mother had backfired on the party, which had been neck and neck with the ruling Civic Democratic Party (ODS) in most opinion polls.
In the event, the Social democrats won only 20.3 percent of the vote in first round voting held on Friday and Saturday. This compared with 36.5 percent for the ODS, led by conservative Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.
While the ODS called a news conference on Monday to trumpet its dominant showing, leading Social Democrats went to ground after a weekend of squabbling over who was to blame.
Vasil Biben, Social Democrat candidate in the north Bohemian town of Trutnov, was blunt in his criticism of Zeman.
""The Social Democrats were were hurt by his pre-election excesses, thanks to which the party lost centre-left voters,"" the daily Mlada Fronta Dnes quoted Biben, who will fight a second round run-off this weekend, as saying.
Shortly before the polls Zeman alleged secret agents had tried to extract compromising information from his elderly mother.
Earlier he had caused uproar when he accused the state intelligence agency BIS of spying on him. But he failed to provide evidence to a parliamentary watchdog and earned a rebuke from President Vaclav Havel.
The Social Democrats divided roughly into those who back Zeman and those who support four rebel deputies who voted with Klaus's coalition in a parliamentary budget vote last month.
Low turnout also hit the centre-left party, which did so well in general parliamentary six months ago that Klaus's centre-right coalition lost its parliamentary majority.
Only 34 percent of the electorate bothered to vote for the newly-created Senate (upper house), which few Czechs seem to understand. But the pro-business ODS proved much better at getting its supporters out than the opposition.
The Social Democrats failed to win most votes in any constituency, although their candidates went through to the second round in 48 of the 81 constituencies by finishing second.
Afterwards Zeman blamed the rebels, who included one of his vice-chairmen, Karel Machovec, for the setback. The defection in early October triggered public squabbling between the party's right wing and former communist colleagues.
Zeman dismissed the row over the BIS as a factor, citing a poll taken before the spy scandal broke which showed a sharp drop in the willingness of Czechs to vote again so soon after general elections.
""When I analyse what happened, and see that this opinion poll preceded the BIS affair, then I can find only one cause and that is the budget vote,"" he said.
One Social democrat rebel, Jozef Wagner, described this as nonsense.
Wagner, who chairs the parliamentary budget committee, noted that the BIS affair had been broken not by Zeman but by Deputy Prime Minister Josef Lux, who leads the Christian Democrats, a junior partner in Klaus's coalition.
Wagner said the Social Democrats should have stayed quiet in the affair, which cost the job of the BIS acting director.

1426,"Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus on Wednesday said the government had approved a plan to privatise at least part of the state's 31.5 percent stake in commercial bank IPB a.s..
Speaking after the government's regular weekly session, Klaus said he had charged Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik with the task of setting conditions for a tender to sell the stake.
He added that no decision on a central bank proposal to merge banks CSOB a.s. and Ceska Sporitelna a.s. had been taken, though the government remained committed to privatising its holdings in the country's four biggest banks.
""He (Kocarnik) is due to submit to the cabinet, in cooperation with a chosen consultancy firm, the criteria for the selection of a strategic foreign partner,"" Klaus said.
Representatives from the state privatisation agency, the National Property Fund (NPF), and the central bank would also be involved in the process of developing the tender.
""The intention is for Mr Kocarnik to come up with the criteria as soon as possible,"" Klaus said.
Klaus did not say how much of the government's stake would be included in the sale to a strategic foreign partner.
Japan's Nomura and Dutch banks ING and ABN AMRO have been widely reported as expressing an interest in the IPB stake.
The central bank has submitted a plan to the cabinet proposing a merger of CSOB, where the Czech government holds 66 percent, and Ceska Sporitelna where it has 45 percent, but Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus has reacted coolly to the idea.
""We did not make any fundamental judgements on mergers today,"" Klaus said. He did not elaborate.
A merger of CSOB and Sporitelna would create post-Communist Europe's largest bank with assets topping $20 billion.
Klaus added that the privatisation of CSOB, which is wholly-owned by Czech and Slovak state institutions, and the selloff of Komercni Banka were complicated because of shareholdings and arrangements between the banks and Slovakia.

""As chairman of the parliament he should know that it is necessary to proceed in the proper ways,"" Havel said at his private residence in the Hradecek region of east Bohemia.
He said Zeman should have first brought the charges to a parliamentary commission overseeing the intelligence services before making them public.
But the president added that he would meet Zeman, who promised to produce evidence backing the claims next week.

""(The privatisation) does not have any exceptional level of urgency,"" Klaus told a news conference after a cabinet meeting.
He said the cabinet would wait until the central bank submitted a more complete plan to the cabinet for the privatisation of the remaining state shares in the large banks.
""It is irrelevant if it is two or three weeks later or two or three weeks sooner,"" Klaus said.
The central bank and the finance ministry have both called for the rapid privatisation of the state's roughly one-third stake in Investicni a Postovni Banka a.s. to a strategic foreign partner.
Japan-based investment bank Nomura and Dutch ING Bank NV are both said to have a strong interest in the IPB stake.
The Czech National Bank, the central bank, also has called for the merger of the largest savings bank Ceska Sporitelna a.s., with the foreign trade bank Ceskovslovenska Obchodni Banka a.s..
If the merger goes ahead, forming a bank with 540 billion crowns ($20.16 billion) in assets based on end-1995 results, the plan would be to privatise the new megabank several years later.
Klaus has balked at the merger plan, saying that it was akin to merging Prague's two top soccer clubs, Sparta and Slavia, which would be hard for Czechs to imagine.
The prime minister has reacted favourably in recent weeks to news that Nomura was keen to buy the state's stake in IPB.
At the news conference Klaus bristled at a series of questions on the subject by foreign news agencies. When asked specifically about the timing of IPB's privatisation Klaus said: ""I don't know if this is the question of some lobbyist who wants to buy some bank fast, or really the general interest of a journalist.""
""From the point of view of the first (case),"" he continued, ""then I think that a party interested in buying or who instigates you into this question is probably in a hurry.""

1439,"Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus on Tuesday said the 1997 Czech state budget, to be presented to the full cabinet in September, plans an overall spending increase of 11.8 percent.
Speaking to reporters after a working session of economics ministers, Klaus also said he did not expect inflation to fall below eight percent next year.
The monetarist economist Klaus, who has said a balanced budget is the ""Alpha and Omega"" of his government, said spending increases would be largest in percentage terms for export supports, regional transportation, and housing.
He said the total expenditure side next year would rise 58 billion czech crowns ($2.21 billion) over expected 1996 spending to 549 billion crowns. The ministers were to discuss the revenue side of the budget later in September.
Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik said the full cabinet should get the full draft for discussion on September 20. When asked if there was talk among ministers of anything excpet a balanced budget Kocarnik replied tersely ""No"".
The government's draft budget has traditionally been debated and passed by mid-December.
Klaus's government has passed four straight balanced budgets, although it will discuss a plan on Wednesday to cut 1996 spending by another 9.3 billion crowns in order to balance this year's ledger.
Klaus said the expenditure figures were still subject to further discussion but he did not expect major changes. Fixed manadatory expenditures are forecast rising by 14.0 percent while discressionary spending would rise 9.9 percent.
Klaus added that state sector wages were planned to rise a nominal 12.4 percent in 1997, and he hoped that it would set an example for private sector budget planning.
""(The government) wants to send a message which would lead to a certain stoppage of the pace of wage increases also in the non-budget (private sector) sphere,"" Klaus said.
Earlier this month the central bank warned of inflationary wage rises not being matched by increases in productivity.
Klaus also said that he did not expect 1997 inflation to fall below eight percent, which was the government's target for lowering inflation in 1996.
""Unfortunately we don't expect a number lower than eight (percent),"" he said.
He did not elaborate on if he meant average or year-on-year inflation. For budget purposes, however, the government usually speaks in terms of average inflation.
Czech year-on-year inflation stood at 9.4 percent in July, while the moving average stood at 8.6 percent.
The government in passing the 1996 budget forecast inflation for the year of roughly eight percent, but strong domestic demand has kept prices higher.

1454,"Five major high tech giants, including Compact Disk inventors Philips Electronics NV and Sony Corp. will on Wednesday unveil details of a new ""CD-ReWriteable"" (CD-RW) technology.
The technology is due to bring re-recordable CD devices to the market in the early months of 1997 at prices below $1,000, and should begin being built into top-end computers next year.
The new format will enable users to store 450 times as much data, including video and audio recordings, as a 3.5 inch floppy diskette and is designed to be compatible with new CD-ROM readers and upcoming DVD-ROM drives.
""ReWritable removes the single biggest barrier to greater market acceptance of CD writing technology,"" said Dave Deane, Future CD Writer Product Manager at Hewlett-Packard Co.'s HWP. Colorado Memory Systems division in Loveland, Co.
Hewlett-Packard, Mitsubishi Chemical Corp. and Ricoh Co. Ltd. are the other companies unveiling the new technology, which has been 18 months in the works.
Analysts said the CD-ROM technology could eventually pressure other storage companies like Iomega Corp. whose revenues have soared on the popularity of its 100 megabyte Zip drives and other storage products, and struggling removeable hard drive maker SyQuest Technology Inc..
""I think this would put some pressure on SyQuest type products,"" said Ray Freeman, president of Freeman Associates Inc. a Santa Barbara market research firm.
""This is a higher-capacity product, so it's not going head-to-head,"" he said, noting that Compact Disks store up to 650 megabytes of data, a larger capacity than Iomega and SyQuest offer on their lower-end consumer-oriented models.
Because the new technology standard is designed to work with common CD-ROM readers and the new DVD-ROM technology, Freeman said its introduction was ""an important step in a continuum,"" following CD-Recordable, a technology on the market since 1991 that allows once-only recording.
Freeman projects the CD-Recordable market will hit 1.3 million units this year, and the combined CD-Recordable and CD-ReWriteable market will more than double to 2.9 million units in 1997 and, combined with DVD systems, grow to 10.65 million in 2000.
Rob van Eijk, director of strategic marketing at Philips' Philips Laser Optics North America, in San Jose, Calif., said the new CD technology is aimed more at the space occupied by 100 million CD-ROMs than the floppy disk space.
The small office home office market and the high end home or small office markets are viewed as key markets for the technology as well, he added, saying the compatibility with other media made it a versatile technology.
Both Philips and Hewlett-Packard expect to offer devices in the first quarter of 1997 which would be under the $1,000 price point, but at a sizeable premium to the CD-Recordable write-once equipment now selling for as low as $499.
Hewlett-Packard's Deane said his company had reached the conclusion that without the new CD-ReWritable technology, ""the potential market would top out at a fairly low number.""

1456,"The semiconductor industry said Monday its key indicator rose last month to the highest level in almost a year, reflecting a surge in new orders for computer chips.
The so-called book-to-bill ratio, which measures the value of new orders compared with shipments over a trailing three-month period, jumped to 1.10 in October from a revised 0.98 in September, marking the first time it has been over 1 since December 1995.
The index, widely regarded as a sign of the computer industry's health, means that manufacturers received $110 in new orders for every $100 in shipments.
The Semiconductor Industry Association said new chip orders in October rose 17.9 percent to $3.84 billion while shipments increased by 5 percent from the previous month to $3.39 billion.
Analysts said the surge was likely a one-time phenomenon as vendors sought to catch up with increasing demand after having pared back inventories sharply early in the year when prices of memory chips in particular were tumbling.
""These strong numbers for new orders in the Americas market should reinforce our industry's cautious optimism for a solid fourth quarter,"" said Douglas Andrey, director of Information Systems and Finance at the Securities Industry Association.
Analysts said they expect computer chip stocks, which had been firm ahead of the announcement on the expectation the ratio would rise modestly to somewhere between 0.99 and 1.03, to advance further following the upbeat data.
Shares of Intel Corp, the world's largest maker of semiconductors, surged as high as $124.69 in after-hours trade, 6 cents below its all-time trading high last week. Earlier, it closed up $1.625 at $123.875 on the Nasdaq market.
""I think it's an overall positive for stocks tomorrow,"" said Charles Boucher, semiconductor analyst at UBS Securities.
""The Street got possibly a little better than they were looking for, so I think you've got a chance to add on to this rally tomorrow,"" he said. ""The danger here is in investors getting too enthusiastic about the size of this number.""
Separately, the trade group said it was planning to phase out the North American semiconductor index and replace it with a global index that would help industry watchers keep better track of demand for computer chips.
The industry group said it was making the change because the current figure only tracks sales and orders in the Americas, representing only a third of the total world market, and provided disproportionate data on certain chip sectors.
While both industry and analysts have criticized the wide fluctuations and frequent revisions in the data -- even the September number was revised to 0.98 from 0.99 -- the move taken by industry consensus met with mixed reviews.
""I think it's a good idea,"" said Intel spokesman Howard High. ""The book-to-bill hasn't really reflected the true health of the industry, good or bad, for quite a while.""
""As the business turned very global in its nature, the book-to-bill flash report was a U.S.-based number,"" he said. ""If you take it to the global market, it's really not done the job that people have been using it for.""
But some analysts said the decision to drop aggregate bookings data altogether would only increase the amount of market uncertainty, as investors would have to rely on far more speculative estimates of new orders.
""I think it's going to blow up in their face,"" one top analyst said. ""It's going to be a lot more speculative. We're all going to be trying to do the analysis but we're going to be doing it based on our own independent surveys.""
Key semiconductor makers had argued, however, that bookings data was imprecise and subject to varying inventory strategies of distributors without any uniform reporting methods.

1457,"Netscape Communications Corp. stock was battered for the second time in less than a week on Tuesday following cautionary comments by a Wall Street analyst regarding the Internet software company.
Merrill Lynch analyst Bruce Smith said in a research note that Netscape had scrambled to make its fourth-quarter goals in a way that could hurt its current first quarter and the outlook for all of 1997.
Netscape stock tumbled more than 10 percent, dropping $4.50 to $42.25 on the Nasdaq market on volume of more than 6.5 million shares. The stock was one of the most actively traded on the exchange.
The stock of the Mountain View, Calif.-based company has lost more than a quarter of its value since the end of 1996, including a drop of around 19 percent after another analysts' warning last Wednesday.
Smith said he remained neutral on the stock but cited industry sources as saying Netscape had scrambled to meet its fourth-quarter numbers at the end of 1996, which he said did not bode well for its current quarter and all of 1997.
""They closed a significant amount of business on Dec. 31 just to make the quarter, which they've never had to do before,"" he said. In his research note, Smith wrote, ""We have heard of two major deals that were closed on Dec. 31, one of which apparently closed late in the evening.""
But a spokeswoman for Netscape rebutted this.
Speaking after the market closed, she said the company did complete some of its deals toward the end of the quarter, but she denied it was pushing down to the wire to lock up deals that would make a major impact on its financial results.
""We did no deals that were of materially significance on Dec. 31,"" she said.
""Sure, we did deals towards the end of the quarter, like everyone does,"" the spokeswoman added.
Last Wednesday, the stock tumbled after Deutsche Morgan Grenfell analyst William Gurley cut his rating on the stock to ""accumulate"" from ""buy"" and cited risks from its transition to a new business plan and new pricing.
Several other analysts, including Goldman Sachs's Michael Parekh and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.'s Mary Meeker, have put ""buy"" or ""strong buy"" ratings on the stock, recognising near-term risks but remaining upbeat on the stock in the longer term.

1459,"Sun Microsystems Inc. on Tuesday will unveil the long-awaiting stripped-down network computer it claims will cost companies up to 80 percent less to own and operate than a personal computer connected to a network.
Sun's Java Computing initiative, including the JavaStation network computer that Sun plans to sell for as little as $750, is the company's challenge to the PC market dominance of Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp.
The formal unveiling at a New York City news conference is the culmination of months of preparation, and the fruition of a strategy that investors consider sufficiently risky to have prompted a sell-off in the company's stock earlier this month.
Microsoft and Intel announced plans Monday to develop a competing product.
Scott McNealy, chairman and chief executive of Sun, recently told analysts he believed Sun's recent strong financial results were related to its focus on network computing.
Sun Microsystems' approach to the Network Computer -- in contrast to those of allies Oracle Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. -- is to target major corporate customers for fixed-function applications.
Early applications will include such tasks as airline and hotel reservations, kiosks, health care systems and stock trading, and Sun expects to highlight a dozen corporate allies, including British Telecommunications Plc, CSX Corp., Federal Express Corp., and FTD Inc.
Sun also is expected to announce support of top systems integrators, including Andersen Consulting and EDS, and nearly 450 independent software developers.
The basic JavaStation itself, which had been code-named ""Mr. Coffee,"" will have the dimensions of an 8.5 by 11 inch piece of paper, weigh four pounds and have no slots, no hard disk, no CD-ROM and no floppy disk drive.
""A fully-configured system, with keyboard mouse and good resolution display will be under $1,000 dollars,"" said Ed Zander, president of Sun Microsystems Computer Co. He said an under-desk machine and a desktop model will be sold.
Sun estimates the machines may cost as little as $2,500 per year to own and administer, or $7,500 over three years, compared with independent estimates of PC costs of up to $11,900, or $35,700 over three years.
The JavaStation family will begins shipping in late December to developers and large customers, with volume shipments beginning in 1997.
Sun is also shipping the Netra j server line, with prices ranging from a U.S. list of $7,695 to more than $200,000. Servers are computers that link personal computers in a network.
Sun's JavaSoft unit, which is charged with expanding use of the company's Java technology, also will demonstrate HotJava Views, a method of viewing electronic mail, World Wide Web pages and scheduling software.
Executives declined to say how much HotJava Views will cost, but added it will be priced similar to other software packages on the market, with volume discounts for large sales.
Separately in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday, the company's SunSoft unit is due to provide details of its next-generation Java Workshop system.
These include Project Studio, which enables users to create interactive content without writing code, Project Speedway, which speeds up Java applications, and Project ICE-T, which helps connect Java machines to other computer architectures.

1460,"U.S. high-tech venture fund investment soared 50 percent in the third quarter as overall U.S. venture investment rose 25 percent in the seasonally-slow period from year-ago levels, according to a survey released on Friday.
""It is so hot it's scary,"" Kirk Walden, who compiles the quarterly Price Waterhouse LLP National Venture Capital Survey, said in an interview.
High-technology industries, from computer software and semiconductors to medical instruments, rose to $1.32 billion in the third quarter, accounting for two-thirds of the $2 billion invested during the period, the survey found.
Software investments alone more than doubled from year-ago levels to $596 million, and in the first nine months of 1996 alone reached $1.74 billion, more than the $1.34 billion recorded for the sector in all of 1995.
For the first nine months of 1996, total venture-backed investments in the country reached $7 billion, nearly the $7.5 billion reported for the full year last year.
""Based on the current rate of venture capital investments, 1996 will certainly be another record year,"" Donald McGovern, chairman of the Price Waterhouse Technology Industry Group, said in a statement accompanying the results.
The third quarter total figure of $2 billion was a sequential drop from the blistering $2.8 billion pace the industry recorded in the second quarter.
""Third-quarter numbers are traditionally lower than second- quarter numbers because deal flow slows considerably in the summer months,"" said Carl Thoma, president of the National Venture Capital Association. ""But the venture capital industry still remains strong. Good deals are being made across the country in all industries.
Companies in the startup and early stages attracted the greatest level of venture capital investment, the study found, with these comprising 46 percent of the 444 companies receiving funds and accounting for $600 million invested.
On average startup companies received more than $3.1 million in funding and, communications firms accounted for nearly 56 percent of the total invested in this category.
Funding for Internet-related companie continued at the high level set in the second quarter of 1996, with 62 Internet- related companies receiving funding in the quarter exeeding the year-ago period by six times.
In a new trend, third quarter venture investment activity appeared to expand beyond the traditionally dominant Silicon Valley and New England areas, whose combined share of investment fell to 33 percent of value invested.
Typically the two regions account for some 40 to 45 percent of the total amount invested by venture funds, and experts said it confirms atriend towards more even distribution.
""Nobody in Silicon Valley is going to panic,"" because of the increase in funding outside the key areas, Walden said.

1462,"Calendar third quarter returns for hotly-competitive Internet stocks will reflect the sacrifice of near-term profits for longer-term growth, analysts said.
Many Internet startups are still fighting to build market share and are expected to continue posting quarterly losses.
""Everything's moving quickly, but people still have to digest the technology, and pay for it...sorting out the winners from the losers and the also rans,"" said Steve Harmon, senior investement analyst at Mecklermedia's iWORLD.  
Typical of the scurry to capture market share by making targeted investments early is Yahoo! Inc.
Yahoo!, started by two venture-backed Stanford University students two years ago to help people navigate the far-flung World Wide Web, has been building on its branded media model during its second full quarter after its initial offering.
The search engine pioneer is due to report after the market close today on its results for the third quarter, and analysts expect a $0.07 a share loss, according to First Call.  
Yahoo! has begun opening metropolitan services in U.S. cities and internationally in Japan and Britain; subject-area services such as quotes and map or individual lookup pages; and demographic offerings like Yahooligans for kids.
Yahoo! has already supplied clues to its quarterly performance potential.  Last week it released traffic figures showing it had one billion full-page ""hits"" in the quarter.
Also expanding internationally, in league with overseas media firms such as Bertelsmann AG, is navigator firm Lycos Inc, which last month reported a loss of $0.16 a share for its fourth fiscal quarter ended in July.  
Infoseek Corp, which has tuned its speedy search technology to target business users in particular, is due to report a third quarter loss of $0.18 a share on October 21.
And on the same day, Excite Inc, which bought out rival McKinley Group this summer and which like Yahoo! and Infoseek has been expanding personalized searching, is expected to post a $0.35 a share loss for the quarter.
Like other subgroups of the Internet sector, financial analysts expect further consolidation in the sector over time.
Netscape Communications Corp is prominent among the handful of Internet-linked shares seen reporting profits.  
By shifting from browsers to tools, Spyglass has racked up steady profits.
Among Internet service providers, First call consensus estimates for Netcom On-Line Communications Inc are for a loss of $1.25 in its third quarter, wider than $0.49 a year ago, while PSINet Inc is expected to narrow its loss to $0.29 from $0.40 in the year-earlier third quarter.
Open Market Inc, which Tuesday unveiled a deal with AT&amp;T Corp, is seen posting a $0.23 a share third quarter loss.  
""This convergence of capital, creativity and opportunity is unprecedented in at least 15 or 20 years and that makes for some hot growth, top and bottom line, but it still takes time to build that bottom line,"" said Harmon.

1466,"For many computer owners, 1997 will be the year when Internet users will begin to see more features aimed at making the Net more lifelike. But it is also likely to be marked by frequent communications breakdowns caused, in part, by increased demand.
""I wrote a year ago about a collapse, but it's really collapses, getting more frequent, deeper and longer,"" said Robert Metcalfe, the inventor of the Ethernet computer networking technology and founder of 3Com Corp. who is now vice president of technology at International Data Group, of Boston, Massachusetts.
Metcalfe said the congestion that causes many people to call the World Wide Web the ""World Wide Wait"" is only one of many problems that can prompt it to crash.
Major outages have been caused by such seemingly minor events as a rodent chewing a power cable or an ampersand typed in the wrong place in software on central Internet devices.
Over the summer, more than six million customers of America Online Inc., the world's largest online computer service, were without service for 19 hours because of a software problem.
In October, a failure at Internet service provider BBN Corp.'s Stanford University Internet facility cut off access for 400 top high tech firms for nearly a day.
MORE OUTAGES AS PROVIDERS TRY TO KEEP UP WITH DEMAND
Experts such as Metcalfe predict similar types of outages next year as telecommunications companies and Internet providers struggle to keep up with demand.
Still, Web surfers are also likely to see many new features in 1997, from advanced graphics to slick ways to communicate with each other using animated characters in virtual chat rooms and high-tech games.
Dozens of companies, including the Germany-based Black Sun Interactive which recently opened an operation in San Francisco, have been developing new virtual worlds based on a technology called Virtual Reality Modelling Language (VRML).
The technology, pronounced ""ver-mul"", enables creators of multi-player computer games, for example, to design lifelike characters and three-dimensional settings that will exploit new 3-D computer chip designs and speeded-up microprocessors with added multimedia features due next year.
New capabilities include interactive, three-dimensional fly-over cities created by the startup Bigbook, which allows users to swoop down on a building and click on it with a mouse to see who the occupants are.
SHOWDOWN OVER ONLINE PORN LIKELY
But as the Net becomes more lifelike, the prospects for a showdown between regulators and free-speech advocates over the issue of online pornography is likely to increase.
In October, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation said it was investigating an electronic mail message sent to thousands of Internet users offering child pornography for sale.
The question of whether to regulate the content of the Internet, both within a country's borders and internationally, comes as officials in Washington are pressing for reductions in sexual and violent content in film and television.
One solution offered by some software firms is a device like television's V-chip, which allows parents to restrict access to certain programmes.
Next year will also see new electronic communities in which people can participate as consumer, customer, contributor or even investor in enterprises over the Web.
Although 1997 will not be the year people rush out to do all their shopping on line, it will be a critical year for deploying the technologies that will make electronic commerce widely available in 1998 and 1999, according to analysts.
Michael Parekh, Internet analyst at Goldman Sachs, expects companies to continue using Internet technology both in internal networks, known as Intranets, and to create what are known as Extranets, to reach customers and suppliers.
""The big thing for 1997 is going to be the way users think of the Web goes from a pull paradigm to a push paradigm,"" he said, referring to the goal of being able to send data to individuals rather than waiting for them to seek it.
In the United States, only about one third of the country's 97 million households have a personal computer, and just 11 percent of U.S. households are estimated to have the modem devices necessary to link them to the Internet.
Faster, 56-kilobit modems are due next year, but analysts expect a battle over standards will slow their spread.

1468,"Intel Corp. President Andrew Grove said the $400 billion personal computer industry must serve up more than just television-like features to impress its most demanding customers: 10-year-old kids.
In an opening speech at the Comdex trade show in which he hailed the 25th anniversary of the microprocessor which Intel invented, Grove demonstrated how PCs with his company's next-generation microchips will be able to deliver full-screen video with theater-like, surround-sound stereo.
But, he said, this would only bring the PC to parity with the television as an entertainment device.
The industry must focus on satisfying ""our most demanding users: 10-year-old kids,"" he said.
Using Intel chips and graphics technology from Salt Lake City-based Evans &amp; Southerland Computer Co., Grove demonstrated how graphics could improve by the year 2000 to provide a more lifelike ""flythrough"" down a quiet English village street.
Demonstrating Intel's renewed emphasis on increasing consumer use of products based on its chips and technologies, Grove said the entire industry needs to focus on satisfying customers with aggressive output of new products.
""My fear is that some day that (product) cycle might sputter,"" he told reporters after his address. The industry should aim to grow by 15 percent to 17 percent a year, as it has for the last decade or more, he said.
""Just as we are investing in technology for the long term, we need to target the new users of the future today.""
This is particularly important as the cost of building a semiconductor plant has risen dramatically from $3 million in 1973 to $2.5 billion for its latest plant and will reach as much as $10 billion entering the next millennium.
Grove said the industry must be prepared to meet consumers' expectations, including those formed over a half century during which the television defined visual experience.
""We are in competition for these consumers, for their dollars and their leisure time,"" he said, arguing that time especially was a ""finite"" commodity and computers needed to compete with TV for consumer share.
Grove said there are only about one-third as many personal computers as TVs installed worldwide, even though the numbers of PCs sold annually is starting to outpace the number of new televisions sold on a worldwide basis.
""In this war, he who captures the most eyeballs wins,"" he said. ""In our battle for eyeballs, user experience on the PC must not only meet the expectation levels set by TV viewing, it must exceed them.""
Grove projected that microprocessors could by the year 2011 be capable of holding 1 billion transistors and deliver 100,000 million instructions per second, or MIPS.
Grove said these advances are possible with current technology. Microprocessors are the semiconductors, invented by Intel engineers in 1971, which serve as the brains of personal computers.

1470,"Even before the personal computer era's foremost figures donned togas and circus suits for the traditional extravaganzas of the industry's annual gala summit, industry titans were jockeying for the limelight.
Although the 25th anniversary of the microprocessor is among the high points of this year's show, the next 25 years of the industry are likely to prove even more fast-paced, and bitterly competitive, according to senior executives.
The week promises a flurry of new products -- and whole new categories of products ranging from hand-held Windows PCs to new species of the controversial new Network Computer to fast new computer modems and the launch of DVD, digital video disk.
The latter technology holds many times the amount of data available on the conventional CD-ROM devices which now come as standard on many desktops, and is likely to appear next year on machines ranging from laptops to home theatre televisions.
Not only will people be able to play full-length movies on their laptop devices, but the new medium is expected to unleash a whole new genre of computer games using sophisticated three dimensional animation and hot new 3-D computer chips.
Although the annual event is prone to hyperbole -- and it is expected to draw nearly a quarter of a million executives, analysts, customers and media people this year -- some high- profile executives believe the time has finally arrived for the long-heralded convergence of television, computers and telecommunications into one vast, interconnected business.
""I think this convergence is starting to redefine itself as collision,"" Carl Wankowski, president and chief operating officer of Sony Electronics Inc., the U.S. operating unit of Sony Corp. told Reuters on the eve of the show.
Sony expects to showcase a variety of products, including DVD technologies and its WebTV set-top box, which turns a television into a simplified Internet browsing device.
The opening keynote of the week-long event will be Intel Corp. Chief Executive Andy Grove, who under the theme ""A Revolution in Progress,"" will trace the history of the microprocessor which turned Intel from a fledgling chip company into the world's largest semiconductor company.
Grove will also provide live demonstrations of how personal computers can already be used for sophisticated applications today for complex graphics displays. He will outline goals and challenges facing the PC industry over the next 15 years, with projections for the next quarter century.
On Tuesday, Microsoft Chairman and Chief Executive Bill Gates promises to issue a challenge to the industry in a keynote speech whose title harkens back to Gates' ""Information at Your Fingertips"" address here six years ago.
Gates, who recently republished his book, ""The Road Ahead,"" in paperback, has said the industry is too optimistic about what it can produce within a short, two-year time frame, but far too pessimistic about what can be achieved in a decade.
Netscape Communications Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jim Barkesdale on Wednesday will make the third of a trio of keynotes that day, providing insight on how the pioneer of Web browsers sees competition moving to internal corporate networks based on Internet technology, known as intranets.
But the celebrations begin already on Sunday night, as International Business Machines Corp.'s Lotus Development Corp. officially launches its SmartSuite 97 for Windows 95 and Windows NT at a lavish gathering to be followed by IBM's famous Toga Party.
Microsoft Corp. is due to unveil the Handheld PC (HPC) devices running its Windows CE consumer electronics version of its system at a Treasure Island Hotel bash complete with a Cirque du Soleil performance.

1483,"Sun Microsystems Inc. stock took a beating Wednesday despite reporting a sharp rise in earnings that topped Wall Street's average forecasts and set milestones for its typically weak first fiscal quarter.
The Mountain View, Calif.-based computer maker said late Tuesday that its profits jumped 45 percent in its fiscal first quarter to $123.4 million, or 63 cents a share, from $84.7 million, or 42 cents a share, in the 1995 quarter. It cited continued strong sales of its computer workstations.
The profits were a shade above Wall Street analysts' average forecast of 61 cents a share as compiled by First Call, which tracks earnings estimates, but investors started taking profits in after-hours trading Tuesday.
Traders noted the stock had run up ahead of the report, and that while Sun's numbers were strong, they were not as strong as had some on Wall Street had been expecting.
Furthermore, some analysts expressed concerns over whether Sun will be able to match the performance in the future in an increasingly competitive market for workstations as rivals introduce new models of their own.
The stock of the Mountain View, Calif.-based computer maker touched its all-time high of $70.25 Tuesday before the earnings report and ended regular trading at $70. But it fell $4 in after-hours trading following the report.
The freefall continued Wednesday, with the shares off as much as $7.625 at one point at a session low of $62.375 and closing the day at $63.125, down $6.875 on Nasdaq trading volume of nearly 18 million shares. It was the most actively traded stock on the exchange.
""We've got to believe there's some profit-taking going on,"" Sun Chairman Scott McNealy told reporters in a conference call Tuesday when informed of the after-hours decline.
A number of analysts trimmed their ratings on the 14-year-old computer maker, mostly saying the stock's price had already soared to near their 12-month trading targets and that the downgrades were based on valuation rather than fndamentals.
Morgan Stanley analyst Steve Mulunovich, for example, cut his rating to ""outperform"" from a ""strong buy"", with a price target of $75 on the stock. However, he also raised his fiscal 1997 earnings estimate to $3.35 a share from $3.30.
The company reported record earnings per share of $2.42 in its 1996 fiscal year, which ended in June.
Alex. Brown analyst Phil Rueppel also cut his rating, to a ""buy"" from a ""strong buy"" and Ferman Selz removed the stock from its recommended list after it hit its $70 price target.
A few analysts also expressed concern that although Sun has received a great deal of publicity over its Java technology, it also will face stiff competition from rivals Hewlett-Packard Co. and Silicon Graphics Inc., which have just introduced speedy new computer models.
Other competitors, like personal computer maker Compaq Computer Corp., are also expected to jump into the market with workstations to compete in the high-end market for machines which has long been dominated by a handful of firms.
""His new competitors are Compaq and Dell Computer. The enemy isn't the traditional competitor but a new class of people that can compete in this space,"" said David Wu, an analyst at Chicago Corp.
Sun scored a small coup Wednesday by hiring Mark Canepa -- a Hewlett-Packard veteran who was just named by Compaq last month to head up its newly formed workstation division -- to instead be vice president of Sun's Workgroup Server Products Group.
Stock in Compaq, whose third quarter earnings also surpassed Wall Street estimates, also fell, closing down $1.50 ato $73.625 in New York Stock Exchange trading.
Some analysts said they saw the weakness in Sun's stock as a buying opportunity.
Dean Witter analyst Jay Stevens said he raised his earnings estimates for Sun and reiterated a buy rating.

1494,"Moving to capitalise on enormous growth in the use of laser printers, Hewlett-Packard Co on Monday will launch a new genre of printers it calls the ""mopier"" to steal work from the copy machine.
The new device, dubbed the HP LaserJet 5Si Mopier, reduces the need to use copiers by allowing workers to make multiple original prints -- or ""mopies"" -- from their own desktop.
HP, which is already a market leader in printers, faxsimile machines and scanners, hopes the new model will help it capture a share of the $18.5 billion a year copier market.
Analysts expect the printers will present a challenge to copy machine giant Xerox Corp and other copier makers, as sales revenues of mid-range 20-30 pages per minute copiers is projected to drop by $300 million to $1 billion by 2000.
""Xerox is a dominant copier and printer vendor. This is a challenge and an opportunity for Xerox,"" said Robert Fennell, industry analyst at the market research firm Dataquest.
The market for midrange printers based on Canon Inc's 24-page per minute engine, until recently a relatively small segment of the market, is projected to surge by some 500 percent this year from 1995, he said.
With a U.S. list price of $9,549, the machine is more expensive than other departmental laser printers, but it contains more features and it is priced less than midrange copiers costing between $13,000 and $20,000.
Executives at Hewlett-Packard's LaserJet Solutions Group in Boise, Idaho, said the Mopier is part of its recently-unveiled Digital Workplace strategy aimed at addressing work flow and document management problems at work.
""Our customer research found that people are already mopying today,"" one of the executives said in an interview.
The new machine is based on HP's existing LaserJet 5Si models, but adds finishing tasks -- such as stapling and collating of documents.
A user-friendly interface to help guide workers through the printing options and tells them when their job is completed.
The Mopier is designed to cut down on the time office workers spend running between printers and copy machines, waiting for others to copy, and fixing paper jams.
It contains a 420 megabyte hard drive and reduces network traffic as well by storing each print task once and printing the number of copies specified, rather than requiring each print job to be sent down the network one at a time.
The initial Mopier model may pave the way for a whole family in the future, if it lives up to its expectations.
The introduction is timed to take advantage of a major shift towards network printing -- International Data Corp. reported the number of pages printed on printers in 1995 for the first year exceeded those printed of photocopy machines.

1495,"Wired magazine remains one of the publishing world's hottest 1990s startups, but on the brink of its parent's initial stock offering some analysts are warning the chronicle of the digerati of the Internet age may prove a better read than investment.
""It's a great read, off Wall Street, but the balance sheet is not quite as neo-designed as the magazine,"" said Steve Harmon, senior investment analyst at Mecklermedia's iWORLD.
The initial public offering of Wired Ventures Inc., the publisher of the magazine, were due to be priced late on Thursday, according to lead underwriter Goldman Sachs.
The offering had been initially due in July but was pulled at the last minute as the market for technology and Internet stocks was tumbling.
Now Internet stocks, most of which have only gone public since the Netscape Communication Corp.'s milestone offering in August 1995, have rebounded nearly 10 percent from their July lows.
Wired Ventures' revised offering has reduced the company's projected market capitalisation by some $200 million, or 42 percent, from its initial plan, according to Harmon, who calculated the company's new market capitalisation at some $300 million based on an IPO price of $13 a share.
Wired intends to sell up to 4.75 million shares at a range of $12 to $14 a share to raise gross proceeds of $61.75 million. This compares with its earlier plan to raise $76 million from sale of 6.3 million shares.
IPO analysts said the company was wise to hold off on its initial offering, enabling it to take advantage of the current pickup in new share offerings coming to market.
Some Internet analysts also said the offering faces a market that is becoming more discerning than in the past, when investors snapped up shares of companies which had minimal operating history and little promise of near-term profits.
""I think they're going to have a little bit of a challenge with this one. It's just fundamentals,"" said one analyst. ""A couple of years ago, when the Internet was just starting, you could have taken your dog named 'Net' public.""
Many investors and analysts compare Wired with traditional print media, since some 90 percent of its revenues are still derived from its high-tech monthly, which since 1993 has been promoted as the magazine of the digital revolution.
Early investors in Wired have included high tech guru Nicholas Negroponte, who heads the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Labs, and publisher S.I. Newhouse.
Wired continues to be among the fastest-growing publishing properties, growing in circulation from 90,000 at the end of 1993, its first year of publication, to an estimated 325,000 in August, according to the company's offering documents.
The company also runs HotWired, a hip Web site geared for those who want to keep on the leading edge of digital developments, and the search engine HotBot.
But IPO experts note the business plan for the Internet operations was still in early development and the company continues to post heavy losses, with a net loss for the first six months of 1996 of $34.7 million, including a $20.5 million writeoff, more than double its revenues of $15.63 million.
At an expected price of some 7.3 times estimated 1996 revenues, the valuation would be cheaper than recent Internet content companies like CNET Inc., which has traded at 20 times 1996 revenues, or Yahoo! Inc., which has been trading at more than 40 times estimated 1996 revenues.
But this is pricey compared to more conventional print media valuations, where two times revenues is often the norm, and four to five times for properties exhibiting strong growth in an otherwise maturing sector, analysts said.
""Wired changed journalism, especially high-tech journalism, and made it cool,"" said Harmon, adding that investors may have difficulty valuing this in financial terms.

1500,"British spirits, pubs and fast food group Allied Domecq on Tuesday reported a fall in annual profits but effectively ruled out a demerger as a solution to its problems.
Allied chairman Sir Christopher Hogg said in a statement the company was ""clear that the best way to improve shareholder value is to improve operating performance and that this should be our overriding objective for the foreseeable future.""
He disappointed market hopes of a demerger of the company's spirits and wines business, saying this option had been ""thoroughly reviewed"" and the company was ""intent on developing the group's two principal businesses.""
Full-year pretax profits to August before exceptionals slipped to 575 million pounds ($947.4 million) from 645 million previously but were within analyst forecasts of between 560 and 581 million.
Allied Domecq said exceptional losses for the year totalled 311 million pounds, the largest part of which was on the 205 million pound sale of its 50 percent stake in brewer Carlsberg-Tetley to Bass in August.
Allied paid out a total dividend of 23.59 pence a share, unchanged from the year ending March 1995, which was used as a comparison because of a change to its accounting period.
""The figures were very much in line with expectations. Some people had been worried the dividend may be cut but it has been maintained and that's a positive,"" one analyst, who asked not to be identified, said.
Allied's shares eased 10 pence to 458 pence by 1040 GMT.
""The divisions have gone in the direction expected but if you were someone who wanted action -- a demerger or management change -- you haven't got either and there will be disappointment,"" the analyst said.
Allied said its corporate restructuring had been largely completed with the sale of its stake in Carlsberg-Tetley and smaller food companies.
Hogg said the group ""must improve the returns it delivers to shareholders."" He said an essential part of this was recognising and remedying overstocking of spirits distributors.
The cost of tackling overstocking of U.S. spirits was the main factor in a 14 percent fall in year trading profits in the group's spirits and wines business, the company said.
Allied said it was ""determined to increase prices (in spirits and wines) where we can,"" adding that strong brands and market leadership were the best basis for achieving this.
The company said it hoped the division would benefit from the increasing focus on key brand/market combinations, more favourable shipment patterns and from efficiency gains.
But it warned that the trading environment ""may offer little prospect of improvement."" The group's retailing business, which includes pubs and fast food outlets, saw underlying profits rise four percent during the year and Allied said it saw further opportunities for developing its leading pub brands.
""The company has said they can grow earnings and that's the way to create shareholder value,"" the analyst said.
But he added that there was still ""a lot of scepticism that they have to dispose of."" ($1=.6069 Pound)

1510,"Shares in Britain's second biggest supermarket chain J. Sainsbury Plc rose on Wednesday after the group held out hope of an improved performance despite a fall in half year profits and sluggish sales.
""The share price rise is a triumph of hope over statistics,"" said one sector analyst.
Sainsbury, which last year was overtaken as market leader by arch-rival Tesco, said half year pre-tax profits slipped, as analysts expected, to 393 million pounds ($637.4 million) from 456 million pounds in the same period last year.
Sainsbury also announced a dividend of 3.5 pence per share, up from 3.4 pence.
The company suffered its first fall in full year profits in 22 years when it reported in May. Pre-tax earnings before exceptional items fell 5.5 percent to 764 million pounds in the business year to March 9, 1996.
After Wednesday's results, several analysts cut forecasts for the current full year to 710-725 million pounds, a level some analysts were already predicting, market sources said.
But shares closed up 8.5 pence to 363.5 pence, in a market which was generally easier after an unexpected quarter-point rise in British interest rates.
The group said current sales from comparable stores, excluding petrol, were rising in line with inflation of around three percent, well below the 7.5-percent gain reported by Tesco in September.
A sector analyst who asked not to be named said ""Sales moving in line with inflation is pretty disappointing, considering they've introduced the loyalty card.""
The Reward card is now accounting for much of the increase in sales Sainsbury is currently seeing.
""Clearly, we want to do better (than three percent)"", chairman David Sainsbury told Reuters. ""This year will be about getting the basics right, next year will be about getting profits moving.""
The company said marketing and operations initiatives along with the Reward card should continue to help boost sales and provide a strong Christmas season.
""We will be fighting on our traditional ground of quality and choice, along with customer loyalty,"" Sainsbury said.
Sainsbury, which last week announced plans to launch a bank with Bank of Scotland, said there would be another ""major development"" on Reward soon and that it would move to strengthen its leadership in quality and choice.
The group also said Dino Adriano, currently deputy chief executive of the supermarket business, will take over from Tom Vyner as chief executive of the unit on March 8 rather than at the end of 1997 as previously planned. ($1=.6165 Pound)

1518,"Political pressures ahead of a general election may mean the latest bids in a wave of takeovers of British regional electricity companies (Recs) do not get a rapid nod from the UK government, analysts said on Wednesday.
""A referral (to competition authorities) is a distinct possibility. I think it is a 50-50 shot,"" said Gordon Culfeather, utilities analyst at Greig Middleton.
Seven of the original 12 cash-rich Recs have now been sold in a flurry of takeovers since they came up for grabs last March after the government's protective golden share expired, five years after privatisation in 1990.
Three of those have been sold to U.S. utilities, who see the UK sector as an opportunity to expand outside U.S. regulatory shackles, particularly into a market which is scheduled to be liberalised to supply competition in 1998.
The latest bid is from  U.S. energy group Dominion Resources which agreed to pay 1.3 billion pounds ($2.15 billion) on Wednesday to take control of East Midlands Electricity, one of only five remaining independent Recs, in an a offer at 670 pence per share.
Northern Electric faces its second hostile approach in less than two years as it battles to throw off a 630 pence per share bid from CE Electric, a unit of U.S.-based CalEnergy, which has already snapped up 29 percent of its target.
Only two bids have so far been blocked by trade secretary Ian Lang, who stunned the market by stopping generators National Power and PowerGen from consuming two Recs earlier this year.
Another two Recs fell prey to their regional water and sewerage companies, while industrial conglomerate Hanson picked up Eastern Electricity, which it now aims to spin off as part of a separate business under its demerger plans.
The remaining victim was Manweb, which succumbed to Scottish Power, an aggressively expansive electricity generator and distributor based in Scotland.
Dominion and East Midlands said they saw no reason for their deal to be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC), adding that a meeting was scheduled with industry watchdog Offer, which initially consults on bids.
""If Lang was following a consistent route, he would not stop these latest bids,"" said one analyst who asked not to be named.
""But if I were a regulator, I would probably want at least five firms to make comparisons,"" he added.
Offer head Stephen Littlechild will send his advice on both bids to Lang for the trade secretary to decide whether they should be referred to the MMC.
Another pressure on Lang is the prospect of a general election, which must be held by May 1997, with the opposition Labour party running ahead in opinion polls and allegations of sleaze miring the current Conservative government.
Its privatisations, which have seen most of Britain's strategic industries sold off, have been heavily criticised for huge executive pay packets, hefty shareholder payouts and heady takeovers which value firms well above privatisation levels.
Labour, which has vowed to levy a ""windfall"" tax on privatised utilities, said in an opening salvo on the latest bids that it planned ""tough, efficient regulation wherever necessary in the privatised utilities and we intend to see it enforced whoever is the owner.""
Lang could chose to refer the bids to the MMC in order to delay any decision on this hot political issue beyond an election, some analysts said.
The market on Wednesday showed its concerns by capping share prices at well below the bid levels, with Northern trading at 592 pence per share by 1450 GMT and East Midlands at 623 pence.
""The market is holding its breath on this issue,"" Culfeather said. ($1=.6054 Pound)

1520,"CalEnergy of the U.S. threw British regional electricity company Northern Electric its second bid challenge in just over a year on Monday with a $1.225 billion offer and analysts said it may succumb.
""We will see an agreed bid eventually,"" said Philip Hollobone at Williams de Broe, who said the price could rise to 650-657 pence per share from the current 630 pence offer.
CE Electric, jointly owned by CalEnergy with 70 percent and U.S.-based construction, mining and telecoms group Peter Kiewit Sons with 30 percent, said on Monday it would pay 630 pence each for the ordinary shares of Northern Electric.
The deal also offers 103 pence per preference share. CE Electric pounced on 12.72 percent of Northern at the bid price of 630 pence as the shares vacillated between a peak of 645 pence and a low of 609.75 pence, trading up 120 pence at 640 by 1320 GMT.
Northern Electric successfully fended off a hostile bid last year from Trafalgar House, now owned by Sweden's Kvaerner, offering the carrot of a special package worth 560 million pounds ($894 million) for shareholders.
That has left its balance sheet too weak to squeeze a substantially higher bid, according to Hollobone.
CalEnergy chairman David Sokol said he felt the offer was ""a very full price,"" adding that CE Electric had sought to agree a bid with Northern Electric but ""the only area we could not agree on was value.""
A rash of bids last year in the electricity sector were made at levels of around 14 times earnings, according to Andrew Stone, analyst at Daiwa, but CE Electric's price values Northern at a ratio of about 10.5.
""There might well be some upside, but I don't think we're likely to see the 14 times earnings figure,"" Stone added.
CalEnergy's Sokol said CE Electric had targeted Northern Electric, based in north-east England, because it wanted to add distribution and supply to its existing skill base of generation while the previous bid had made information on the regional electricity company more accessible.
In addition, he said Northern's size was ""very manageable.""
""They are the smallest regional electricity company and that means that you can get them cheaper,"" said one analyst who asked not to be named.
Northern urged its shareholders to do nothing and said it would make a further statement later on Monday, while CalEnergy's Sokol said he hoped to secure a recommended bid.
Rumours a U.S.-based company, possibly Houston Industries or Duke Power, might bid for one of the five remaining independent British regional electricity companies sent shares surging on Friday, but Northern had been seen as one of the least attractive because of its high gearing.
East Midlands Electricity, which led Friday's climb, slipped back 9.5 pence to 555 pence, while Yorkshire Electricity added nine pence to 757 pence and Southern Electricity rose 18.5 pence to 647 pence with London Electric gained 16 pence to 600 pence.
Some analysts suggested that CE Electric might have to raise its bid to cover a 56.5 pence special dividend which Northern intends to pay as a special dividend in February.
CalEnergy is a U.S.-based power generator which uses geothermal, natural gas and hydroelectric resources and operates facilities worldwide. Total assets are $3.5 billion with a market capitalisation of $1.9 billion. ($1=.6264 Pound)

1521,"Shares in media group Pearson rose sharply on Monday as takeover speculation swirled on a report, later denied, that broadcaster BSkyB might be planning a bid, just days after new management was appointed.
""The price was boosted last week by the management change but now it reflects revived bid speculation,"" said one sector analyst who declined to be named.
Pearson shares were up 25 pence at 721-1/2 pence by 1115 GMT after touching a peak of 745 pence, a high for the year.
A report in Monday's Independent newspaper said BSkyB, in which Rupert Murdoch's News Corp has a 40 percent stake, was in the early stages of planning a bid worth more than four billion pounds ($6.4 billion) in cooperation with a U.S.-based media group.
But BSkyB's chief executive, Sam Chisholm, was quoted in later editions of Murdoch's Times newspaper saying there were ""no talks taking place between News Corp, BSkyB or any associated company about a bid for Pearson.""
BSkyB was not immediately available for comment on Monday.
Pearson, which owns the Financial Times newspaper, Penguin Books and a number of television production companies, said it did not comment on speculation.
Analysts said although BSkyB appeared to have ruled itself out of a bid, observers felt any move on Pearson was likely to be made before new management takes control next year.
Last week, Pearson appointed Marjorie Scardino to be chief executive from January 1 -- the first female head of a company represented in the key FT-SE 100 share index -- and Dennis Stevenson chairman.
""If someone is thinking seriously about a bid, now is the time to do it. The new management hasn't arrived yet and so it would be harder to mount a defence,"" said one media analyst who asked not to be identified.
But analysts said Pearson shares were now approaching the top end of their price target range for full valuation of the business and the price tag attached to speculation around BSkyB was high.
""It is touching the stratosphere at these levels,"" said Anthony De Larrinaga of Panmure Gordon.
The media analyst said it was difficult to put a price tag on Pearson because its diversified nature meant it could have specific attractions for a variety of bidders.
Speculation of a bid for the company last surfaced in August when Anglo-Dutch publisher Reed-Elsevier was rumoured as a possible buyer.
After initial stock market disappointment, Scardino's appointment at Pearson was greeted with a 12 pence jump in shares on Friday as hopes emerged that she might reorganise the sprawling media company.
The Sunday Times newspaper reported that a sale of its television interests, which include soap opera and games show producer Grundy, might be on the cards.
""It may be that BSkyB want to acquire Grundy or Thames Television but whether they would want the entire group is another matter,"" said Anthony De Larrinaga of Panmure Gordon.
So far, Scardino appears to be keeping her options open, analysts said.
""There is no real evidence yet that she would consider any demergers and it is open to question whether such a move would bring shareholder benefit,"" the sector analyst said.
""We have the stock on a hold at the moment. Let's see what the new management comes up with and let's see if there is anything concrete behind this bid speculation,"" he added. ($1=.6298 Pound)

1523,"J. Sainsbury Plc announced plans Friday to launch a jointly owned banking service with Bank of Scotland, the first supermarket to do so in Britain's hotly competitive food retailing business.
""It could be a winner if it is done in the right way,"" said one industry analyst who asked not to be identified.
Sainsbury said it had applied to the Bank of England for authorisation for a new bank to be owned 55 percent by the company and 45 percent by the Bank of Scotland, based in Edinburgh.
The venture, to be called Sainsbury's Bank, will offer telebanking services for deposits, lending and cash management to a target audience of 12 million customers, Sainsbury said. It will kick off next year with the launch of Classic and Gold Visa cards along with account and card-based services.
""It certainly shows Sainsbury is alive and kicking, which we had begun to doubt,"" one sector analyst said.
Sainsbury, which posted lower profits for the first time in 22 years last year, was forced to launch its Reward loyalty card in June after archrival Tesco Plc offered its ClubCard, which allows shoppers to build up credit balances at favourable interest rates to be used in Tesco stores.
But Sainsbury's move makes ClubCard Plus look timid, one analyst said. ""The market wanted to see them doing something and this is certainly a pleasant surprise,"" the analyst said.
Sainsbury Chairman David Sainsbury said that Sainsbury's Bank would give customers ""the reassurance of a name they know and trust, coupled with the banking expertise of the Bank of Scotland.""
The move will result in ""a compelling alternative ... for Sainsbury's customers,"" said Bank of Scotland Chief Executive Peter Burt.
Analysts warned, however, that Sainsbury's Bank would have to offer attractive deals to secure customers, many of whom already have bank accounts.
""It has to undercut the competition or link banking up to Reward points, a lot will depend on the marketing,"" one industry analyst said.
Another warned that the financial services of retailer Marks &amp; Spencer, although not directly comparable, made only a small contribution to profits even though it had been running for 15 years.
""They will have to decide to really go for it if they are going to make it profitable,"" he said.
Analysts said the market would still look for progress in its core grocery business sales when Sainsbury reports interim results on Oct. 30.
Sainsbury shares rose 10.5 pence (17 cents) to 360.5 pence ($5.75). Tesco rose 2.5 pence (4 cents) to 324 pence ($5.17).

1527,"Britain's decision to take legal action to ban Resale Price Maintenance (RPM) on non-prescription medicines is likely to boost competition and could benefit some stores in terms of market share, analysts said on Friday.
""Anything that actually causes prices to fall is not good news (for retailers), but for those wanting to increase market share it will mean more people coming through the stores,"" said one share analyst who asked not to be identified.
Office of Fair Trading head John Bridgeman said in a statement earlier that he would seek to remove RPM from over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, because ""there are good reasons for believing that it is time to end price-fixing.""
RPM allows manufacturers to set minimum levels for sale of certain over-the-counter medicines. The Community Pharmacy Action Group, which lobbies on behalf of pharmacies, said its removal could mean the closure of one in four local outlets.
The OFT's request goes to the Restrictive Practices Court which is unlikely to be able to consider the issue before late 1997, Bridgeman told a press conference.
Retailers therefore did not appear to be about to start an immediate round of price cuts.
Chemist and beauty products store chain Boots said it was disappointed at the decision and believed that RPM ""operates in the public interest.""
Boots has not reduced prices of such medicines during a long-running inquiry into price-fixing and industry sources said it was unlikely to take that route in the near future.
UniChem, a pharmaceuticals wholesaler and retailer, said removal of RPM would be ""immaterial to...profitability,"" while Superdrug, the high street chemist chain owned by Kingfisher, welcomed the move but ruled out immediate price cuts.
Supermarket retailer ASDA, which has led the campaign over the last year to have RPM removed after successfully lobbying for it to be withdrawn from books, also welcomed the OFT's decision, saying it could save consumers 300 million pounds ($476 million) on everday healthcare products.
But it said its stance on prices would not change.
""RPM is still in place, we are still in the same situation we were in yesterday and we will still be in it tomorrow,"" a spokesman said.
ASDA is currently refusing to sell Anadin Paracetamol, a painkiller produced by Whitehall Laboratories, and large packs of indigestion treatment Alka Seltzer, after it baulked at manufacturers' price increases.
It has launched a range of some 40 own-brand OTC medicines and vitamins selling for as little as half the price of branded equivalents, and says they have helped it extend market share.
Also on Friday, ASDA said it was launching an initiative to help support local pharmacies, shops which chief executive Allan Leighton told BBC television he had no wish to see put out of business.
Share analysts said that removal of RPM on non-prescription medicines could see specialists such as Boots increasing market share, reflecting events after RPM was taken off books when specialist retailer W H Smith increased market share.
""Smiths got stronger, increasing market share through promotions and using muscle with suppliers. I expect the same will happen to Boots - it'll get bigger and stronger,"" said Nick Bubb of MeesPierson.
Boots shares dipped on the news and stood at 638-1/2p, down 5p, by 1440 GMT. ASDA was up a penny to 114-1/2 pence while Kingfisher was down 1-1/2 pence at 654 pence. ($1=.6298 Pound)

1530,"British opposition Labour party's plans for a one-off ""windfall"" tax on utility companies may be causing more stock market damage through uncertainty than the tax itself would, analysts said on Thursday.
If it won the next general election, due within six months, Labour has said it would levy a tax to reap excess profits from recently privatised utilities to help pay for welfare reform.
""The market does not like uncertainty -- give it a tax like this with no parameters and it will assume the worst-case scenario,"" said one analyst who asked not to be named.
As parliament prepared to debate the issue, at the prompting of the ruling Conservatives, analysts said if the Labour party would be more specific about plans, some of the uncertainty weighing on utility shares might lift.
""They have promised to raid the utilities but they have not said which, how much or when, and that is damaging,"" said Philip Hollobone, analyst at Williams de Broe.
Labour, which is well ahead in opinion polls, has said it would use the funds to tackle youth and long-term unemployment but has declined to set target companies, amounts or timeframes.
Newspaper reports have suggested the tax might be aimed at raising more than five billion pounds ($8.42 billion) and possibly as much as 10 billion pounds.
Speculation on possible targets has widened to include up to 30 companies, like British Telecom, British Gas and perhaps airport operator BAA Plc, in addition to the water and electricity companies initially pointed to.
Some of these, such as BAA, have already rehearsed arguments why they should not be included in any windfall tax net.
The water and electricity sectors, privatised around the start of the decade by the Conservatives, became unpopular after a spate of huge executive pay rises, hefty dividend payouts, and head-turning takeovers deals.
One analyst who declined to be named, suggested that the water sector stocks are currently undervalued by around five billion pounds, reflecting concerns over the tax.
Thames Water, for example, has underperformed the FT All Share Index by as much as 10 percent since late August, according Reuters Securities 3000 data, although its relative has improved recently to underperformance of some four percent.
Shares in regional electricity companies, however, were pulled in two directions as a resurgence of bids in the sector boosted speculation which analysts said may have offset some of the downside of a utility tax.
""The worries over the windfall tax are severely overdone...even if it does happen, most companies will be able to find the money, even if they do not want to,"" said Hollobone.
Along with several other analysts, he warns that even if Labour does win power it may not be able to effect the tax because of legal problems in ensuring it is non-discriminatory.
Several utility companies have said they would challenge any windfall tax plans in court, but Labour's treasury spokesman Gordon Brown described the proposal as ""legally iron tight.""
On Thursday, the Institute of Directors (IoD), which represents British business interests, warned against the tax although it acknowledged that ""some of the utilities do have spare funds at the moment.""
The IoD said the tax could lead to problems over who should pay what amounts and said customers might face increased prices.
The Conservatives have claimed the tax could mean an extra 192 pounds on the average household bill and challenged Labour to come up with figures to contradict this.
""Investors who are wise to the market's over-caution on the proposed tax are buying. These stocks are undervalued and...some are yielding more than long-term bonds,"" said one analyst.

Sainsbury announced on Friday that it had applied for authorisation from the Bank of England to set up Sainsbury's Bank in which it would have 55 percent with Bank of Scotland taking 45 percent.  
He said the banking service would offer ""great products...at better value than is currently available,"" but declined to comment on possible interest rates on accounts.
Sainsbury will draw on its database of customers signed up to its Reward loyalty card and other store cards for direct marketing of the banking facilities, McCarten said, but added that it was not planning to limit access to these customers.
""Our objective is to build (the business) across the UK,"" he said.  
Sainsbury currently has about five stores in Scotland, while Bank of Scotland will benefit because it has a limited presence south of the border.
""It's a lovely distribution channel,"" a Bank of Scotland spokesman told Reuters, adding that the new bank would have its own identity and would not carry the Bank of Scotland logo.
McCarten said there would not initially be banking counters in stores but added it could not be ruled out for the future.  
No decision has yet been reached on use of cash dispensers, the Bank of Scotland spokesman said, although he ruled out stand-alone machines.
McCarten said the banking facilities would be ""completely separate"" from its Reward loyalty card other than using the database.
He added that the aim was to encourage customers to see banking as part of Sainsbury's supermarket offer, which should have a knock-on effect for the stores.

1537,"Virginia-based Dominion Resources Inc., continuing an American invasion of the recently privatised utility industry in Britain, agreed Wednesday to acquire East Midlands Electricity Plc for about 1.3 billion pounds ($2.15 billion).
Executives from Dominion met East Midlands management late Tuesday to offer 6.7 pounds ($11.07) a share for one of five remaining independent electric companies in Britain.
But East Midlands shares languished well below the offer price Wednesday as concerns emerged that the bid might face obstacles from British competition authorities.
""Everyone's expecting the MMC (Monopolies and Mergers Commission) to take a close look at the deal,"" said one trader.
Dominion, based in Richmond, Va., said last week it was considering a bid ""at a price not much in excess of 608 pence per share."" But East Midlands scorned that price, saying it would undervalue the Nottingham-based electricity company.
East Midlands Chairman Sir Nigel Rudd said Wednesday that his board was recommending the latest offer ""because it represents fair value for an excellent business, which has successfully differentiated itself from the sector.""
Seven of Britain's original 12 regional electricity companies have already been bought -- four by U.S. firms -- since they came up for grabs last March when the government's protective golden share expired, five years after privatisation in 1990.
""Dominion's offer looks a fair compromise price,"" said Chris Perry, utilities analyst at Charterhouse Tilney.
But he added that there were ""very genuine concerns"" that the offer might be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Dominion Chief Financial Officer Linwood Robertson said in an interview that the company was talking to the regulator.
""We intend to run this as a stand-alone business,"" he said, adding that he certainly hoped for approval.
He also said the group hoped to keep East Midlands' management team, which is highly regarded by industry analysts.

1552,"Chen Yifei, China's top-selling modern artist, is back home in Shanghai, basking in the glow of his international success and planning a shift in subject matter -- this time to illustrate China's Generation X.
The artist, best known for his almost photographic paintings of Chinese beauties, opened his first-ever retrospective exhibition on Saturday in the new Shanghai Museum.
The show, running through to January 19 before going on tour to other cities, is Chen's first exhibition in China.
It brings together more than 40 works from a variety of public and private sources, including drawings from Chen's youth during the 1960s Cultural Revolution, through to his latest paintings depicting the strong faces of Tibetan peasants.
But his next artistic goal is to capture on canvas the feel of Chinese urban youth in the mid-1990s, increasingly influenced by trends and concepts from beyond the borders of China, particularly Western culture.
""I want to do something on the life of the new generation, the ones I see dancing at the Hard Rock Cafe or New York New York (a Shanghai disco),"" Chen said in an interview.
""This is a new generation of China after the revolution. I look at them and I think about the value of life. They look very happy, but maybe thinking a different way,"" he said.
MODERN CHINA'S TOP-SELLING ARTIST
Chen holds the record for the highest price paid at auction for a modern Chinese painting -- 2.86 million yuan ($344,000) for a Tibetan-theme painting called Wind of the Mountain Village, now owned by a Chinese securities firm.
Now 50 years old, Chen left China in 1980, the first mainland Chinese artist to emigrate to the United States in modern times.
But in spirit and in terms of artistic inspiration, he never really left.
His most famous paintings so far are a series of life-like portraits of Chinese women dressed in traditional garb, while his paintings reflecting the atmosphere of old Shanghai are well-known.
He continues to produce landscapes showing the canals and villages of the east China region that is his ancestral home and looking at his Tibetan portraits, you can almost smell the yak butter.
China is also at the heart of his other artistic interest -- making movies. In recent years, he has directed several movies with mixed commercial success but he says he is determined to press on with this branch of the visual arts.
He is currently working on three film projects, the first of which will be a documentary on the Jews who lived in Shanghai in the years before the Communist take-over in 1949, most of them refugees from repression in Europe.
CHINA'S NEW GENERATION OF ARTISTS
Chen said he was impressed by the standard of younger Chinese artists, particularly in Beijing and Shanghai, but declined to name any favourites.
""Many of the new generation are very hopeful. China will become very important on the world art market, the standard is really very high,"" he said.
He maintains apartments in New York and Shanghai, but there's an important difference.
""In my heart, Shanghai is my home,"" he said. ""This is where I grew up. In New York, it's just a room.""
He said he was really happy to see Shanghai developing so fast and so strongly.
""Everyone is watching Shanghai. If it can continue this level of development, this place has a lot of hope.""

1560,"China is firming up a shortlist of foreign banks that will be allowed to do local renminbi currency business, foreign bankers said on Monday.
Hongkong Bank, Citibank and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi are expected to be among the winners, they said.
Foreign banks with branches in China, currently restricted to doing business in foreign exchange, have been promised that a handful will be given the right to take deposits and make loans in the Chinese currency before the end of the year.
""The Hongkong Bank, Citibank and Bank of Tokyo are in, the Chinese have made that clear,"" said one banker. ""There may also be a European bank and a Hong Kong-based bank added as well, but they may not. They are being very cautious.""
""The decision will be made as always on a geopolitical basis -- one from America, one from Japan, one from Europe,"" said a Hong Kong-based European banker.
Officials from Hongkong Bank and Citibank declined to comment on their chances and Bank of Tokyo executives were not available.
But other bankers said there were still conflicting reports as to when the announcement would be made.
""It has to happen soon,"" said a Shanghai-based banker. ""We've waited far too long. We're all tired and bored with the waiting.""
Once the announcement has been made, foreign bankers said they expected it to offer only very limited renminbi business rights, restricted to taking in money from, and lending money to, foreign-funded enterprises in China.
""The funding problem is the key one,"" said a foreign banker. ""Foreign-funded firms wouldn't generally want to put their renminbi on deposit with a bank, it's their working capital. If they did, it would be an act of charity (towards the banks).""
The foreign banks will definitely not be allowed in the foreseeable future to take in deposits from Chinese firms or individuals, bankers said.
The answer may be that the People's Bank of China, the central bank, will lend renminbi funds to the foreign banks to lend on to customers, thereby giving the central bank power to control the extent of the business, they said.
Once the first batch of banks have begun to do limited renminbi business, it could be as much as a year before any other foreign banks are allowed to join them, bankers said.

1578,"China unveiled on Tuesday the country's first major shipping exchange which it hopes will consolidate and standardise ship chartering and cargo fixing in East China and be a focus for the shipping trade nationwide.
Officials told a news conference that all shipping and freight companies in the east China region had been told to move their business as soon as possible to the new Shanghai Shipping Exchange.
Like the Baltic Exchange in London, the Shanghai Shipping Exchange will allow ship owners and charterers to arrange deals and fix prices for carrying cargoes.
The exchange, which has the direct support from the Beijing authorities, has been under preparation for two years and has as its founding members 116 companies, mostly shipping firms in Shanghai and the adjacent provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangsu.
""The foundation of the exchange shows the government's determination to make Shanghai into an international shipping centre,"" said Zhang Jinxiang, an official with China's biggest shipping firm, COSCO.
""Other world shipping centres such as London and New York also have such exchanges,"" Zhang added. ""With China's fast-growing economy and Shanghai's good location, the exchange should help attract more shipping companies here.""
Zhu Yongguang, a senior Ministry of Communications official told the news conference that the Shanghai exchange was one of a number of shipping and freight exchanges planned for China.
""There will be Tianjin in the north, Shanghai in the east, Guangzhou in the south and Wuhan inland. But the focus of the business nationwide will be the Shanghai exchange,"" he said.
Zhu declined to speculate on how much business the exchange would attract, but said:
""This will be a gradual thing. The shipping companies (in East China) will be expected to move their business to the exchange, but it won't happen overnight.""
Members of the exchange include ship-owners, mostly state-run companies in Shanghai and surrounding areas, and freight forwarders.
The exchange will handle international cargo-fixing, but most of the business in the initial stages is expected to be domestic.
The establishment of the exchange was welcomed by an official for Shanghai Haixing Shipping Co, China's second-largest shipping company and its largest in domestic trade.
""The exchange may help cut illegal competition in the shipping market,"" the official said. ""At present, there are some small shipping firms which make use of improper relationships or offer high commissions to get business.""
Exchange officials said the exchange was under the supervision of the Ministry of Communications and the Shanghai city government and would be treated for the foreseeable future as ""experimental"", in line with other new markets in China.

1579,"The crackdown on China's young stock markets has triggered huge losses in share values and highlighted problems, particularly widespread irregularities and the lack of a regulatory structure, analysts said on Friday.
The week of losses on the exchanges in the wake of a Beijing warning on speculation was also a re-run of the age-old Chinese boom-and-bust cycle: controls are relaxed, rule-breaking surges, the screws are tightened and the machine almost breaks.
""Widespread irregularities are partly a legacy of the old planned economy,"" said one economist. ""But given the power of administrative edicts to influence the markets, some firms have no choice but to resort to irregularities to survive.""
The sudden announcement of Beijing's wrath at the unruly stock markets, expressed in a People's Daily commentary on Monday, aimed to dampen speculative trading, but ironically could have the opposite effect, some analysts said.
""Policy changes have always been a key speculative topic on China's stock markets,"" said one trader. ""To regulate the markets with official orders like this time might temporarily depress the speculative mood, but in longer term, it will further add weight to the speculative fever on policy shifts.""
Market sources said that had Beijing used market means rather than administrative edicts to check the dangerous roller-coaster trend in share trading, the response of the markets would have been much less volatile.
As it was, Shanghai's domestic A share index plunged 20.07 percent to 922.34 points at the close of Friday's trading against Friday's close last week, while the foreign currency B index was down 3.84 percent to 63.743 points.
In Shenzhen, the A share index nosedived 29.07 percent on the week to 328.96 points, while the B index lost 15.94 percent to 125.56.
""Most investors are pessimistic about the short-term trend with turnover sharply down this week against last week,"" said one broker. ""We had nearly no new accounts opened this week.""
""The inflow of fresh money into A shares has almost stopped completely,"" a Shenzhen-based trader said. ""Many investors are in despair seeing the price of their shares diving nearly every day.""
Analysts said the dramatic changes this week sparked reflections on the bust-boom cycle which has dominated China's stock markets since they were re-established in 1990.
At its height, Shanghai's A share index had surged more than 100 percent and its Shenzhen counterpart over 300 percent since April when Beijing announced that it supported stock market development.
""The markets are poorly regulated,"" said one stock analyst. ""One of the reasons for this is the lack of a national securities law governing the stock market.""
The draft Securities Law, the topic of hot debate in the corridors of power in Beijing for years, is not expected to be enacted soon, analysts say.
Irregularities, including manipulation of selected share prices, have been rife in the Chinese markets for years.
In an effort to bring the industry to heel, authorities over the past month have punished branches of nearly all major state-run banks and securities houses for involvement in shady stock dealings.

1582,"China's futures markets, which fell deeper into the gloom of official disapproval in 1996, look set for an even tighter year in 1997 with some small exchanges likely to be swallowed by bigger ones, analysts said on Friday.
There is still no sign of the long-awaited Futures Law being unveiled, but the analysts said the securities authorities have promised some new regulations in the first half of 1997 to provide a stronger regulatory basis for futures trading.
The markets, set up in the early 1990s, quickly became casinos with huge trading on commodities with often very small physical quantities for delivery, making the use of the markets for hedging -- the original purpose -- virtually impossible, analysts said.
In the past two years, trading volumes on China's futures exchanges have plummeted in the face of a relentless campaign by the securities authorities in Beijing to squeeze speculative activity out of the markets.
""The official measures, especially the ban on many institutions from trading futures, have pushed large amounts of money out of the markets and dramatically pulled down trading volumes on most exchanges,"" a local futures analyst said.
The Shanghai Metal Exchange, which is the least speculative of the 14 futures exchanges left open, expects total trade volume of 230 billion yuan in 1996, down from 455.8 billion yuan in 1995 and a high of 682 billion yuan in 1994, an exchange official said.
The authorities have ruthlessly hounded the speculative ""hot money"" which used to chase its way round from Suzhou red beans to Zhengzhou green beans and Hainan coffee, and have largely succeeded in killing the enthusiasm of speculators for futures.
In March, the China's Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) banned securities brokerages, trust and investment firms and state-run enterprises from trading commodities futures, forcing many traders out of the industry, traders said.
All commodity futures exchanges have been ordered to cap daily price movements and total holdings.
In October, the CSRC also abolished limits on the total amounts of goods for physical delivery, which was used to make it possible for wealthy institutions to build up huge long positions and then short-squeeze the market.
""Beijing has stressed restrictions rather than development for the futures markets because officials are angry about the repeated violations of rules and rampant irregularities,"" a local trader for metal futures said.
""No new money is coming into the futures markets,"" he added. ""There are several safer investment methods, such as stocks and treasure bonds. Why take the extra policy risk?""
""Few people will pay much more attention to China's futures markets until the long-awaited Futures Law is introduced, which will indicate that the government has accepted the industry,"" a second trader said.
""It will still take some time for the Futures Law to be completed,"" a local exchange official said. ""But the CSRC has said it will announce five new rules for the industry in the first half of the next year to fill up the regulatory vacuum.""
Analysts said some of China's 14 existing futures exchanges will probably be closed down, merged or taken over in 1997 as the authorities continue their efforts to clean up the industry.
It is believed the authorities want to end up with four or five big exchanges.
In October, China's securities authorities ordered the Changchun United Commodity Exchange to merge with the Beijing Commodity Exchange, which was seen as the first of an expected series of mergers of exchanges, the analysts said.
""There are too many exchanges in China with most of them trading similar contracts and trading volumes for most contracts are too thin for hedging,"" a Shanghai-based dealer said.

1584,"Last week's stern crackdown on China's stock markets has increased the speculative instinct of investors to trade on rumours of policy shifts rather than on fundamentals, analysts said Monday.
The share markets started their latest bull run in April when Beijing announced it would support the markets.
Rumours and guesses about Beijing's attitude and plans have been the primary trading factor ever since, the analysts said.
While the Beijing authorities have been trying to convince investors to look more at long-term investment based on the fundamentals of the economy and of individual companies, they again chose an old-fashioned means of reining in the markets.
""The crackdown has shown again the risk of policy changes for China's stock markets,"" said an executive with a major Chinese securities house.
""Policy changes have been a very hot speculative topic in the past and the use of administrative orders like this to cool down the markets will make them an even hotter topic in the long run,"" he added.
Beijing last Monday charged that China's two stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen were overheated and warned that Beijing would not come to investors' rescue if the markets crashed.
""The action has cooled speculative activity for now,"" said an analyst with a foreign brokerage in Shanghai. ""But the investment pattern has not changed. It is still political issues which drive the stock market up and down.""
In the shake-out last week, investors generally took refuge in blue-chip shares and dumped the so-called ""rubbish shares"" that have soared in recent months on the basis of little more than an impression that Beijing wanted the markets up.
Analysts said market psychology could have been better influenced if the authorities had pulled share prices back down using market means such as the issue of more shares or the listing of some state or institutional shares.
One key problem of the Chinese stock markets is the lack of suitable supervisory mechanisms and regulations, leading to widespread irregularities such as share price manipulation and the use of credit for stock trading, the analysts said.
""With a stock market law lacking and regulations incomplete, many trading activities are in a legal no-man's land, making it difficult to check irregularities,"" said one analyst.
The draft Securities Law, the topic of hot debate in the corridors of power in Beijing for years, is not expected to be enacted any time soon, due partly to differences over who will have the final say on securities policy, the analysts said.
Responsibility for securities policy at present overlaps between the Securities Commission under the State Council (cabinet), the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the People's Bank of China, or central bank.
Shanghai's domestic A share index rose 17.606 points or 1.91 percent on Monday to end at 939.946 after losing about 20 percent in last week's trading. The foreign currency B share index was up 0.944 points or 1.48 percent to 64.687.
In Shenzhen, the A share index fell 6.71 points or 2.04 percent to 322.25, while the B share index soared 6.11 percent or 7.68 points to 133.24.

1588,"China is expected to end the year without loosening its three-year old tight credit policy as rampant local fixed asset investment continues to threaten economic over-heating, analysts said on Thursday.
Earlier this year, China seemed poised to modify the austerity measures, but a surge in fixed asset projects since July has led Beijing to change its mind, they said.
In the latest high-level clue to credit policy, Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji was quoted by the official media on Thursday as saying there was a need to strictly control new fixed asset investment projects.
""There is the need to continue to curb inflation and strictly control new industrial projects,"" Zhu was quoted as saying during a recent visit to the eastern coastal province of Fujian.
The People's Daily, mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, on Wednesday also criticised a rush by provinces to invest in high-profile industries, citing 22 provinces that had listed car production as one of their key industries.
""There is still the threat of a resurgence of inflation and of the economy over-heating with fixed asset investment climbing again since the central bank cut bank interest rates earlier this year,"" said a Beijing-based official with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC).
Growth in retail price inflation is expected to slow to six percent year on year in 1996 against 14.8 percent last year.
Official figures show that local governments around the country have allowed 700 new fixed asset investments since July.
China's State Planning Commission estimates that fixed asset investment will hit 2.3 trillion yuan ($277.1 billion) this year, about three times the level of 1992.
""The resurgence of fixed asset investment in the second half of this year seems to have made the central bank more cautious about loosening credit,"" a banker with the Bank of China said. ""The most important signal is that the much-discussed bank reserve ratio cut now seems to be off the near-term agenda.""
In mid-July, Dai Xianglong, president of the People's Bank of China, said the central bank would shortly cut bank reserve ratios by a margin possibly as large as three percent. This would release huge amounts of money into the market.
Chinese banks and other financial institutions are required to place 13 percent of their deposits with the central bank and keep another five to seven percent themselves as reserves.
Between July and October, central bank officials talked frequently about cutting the bank ratios, which were set eight years ago and have never been changed.
""But now they are focusing on the need to continue the austerity measures,"" said an analyst with the Communications Bank of China. ""The main concern is the large amount of money in the system beyond the direct control of the central bank.""
China's central bank has direct control of the four major state banks -- the ICBC, the Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China and the Construction Bank of China.
Credit supplied by the four banks once accounted for more than 90 percent of total loans but this proportion has now shrunk to around 70 percent and is still falling.
Analysts said the impact from a cut in bank reserve ratio could be balanced by other policy controls such as the credit quota system.
But the bulk of money liberated from other banks and financial institutions would inevitably enter the markets with the central bank being unable to directly intervene.

1589,"China will open its domestic A share markets to overseas investors through Sino-foreign joint venture mutual funds early next year, a Hong Kong newspaper said on Tuesday, but analysts predicted a cautious approach.
Brokers and analysts in Shanghai said the long-awaited experiment in foreign investment in China's A share markets would probably involve only a handful of funds in the first few years.
The Beijing-controlled Hong Kong newspaper Wen Wei Po quoted the executive deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, Chen Yuan, as saying China will allow some foreign joint venture firms to invest in A shares from early next year.
The newspaper quoted Chen as saying regulations governing Sino-foreign investment funds would be issued soon.
""Rumours on this have been circulating in the markets since the start of this year,"" said one A share trader. ""It is certain that the regulations are under consideration, but a timetable has yet to be confirmed.""
Officials at the central bank and the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the top securities watchdog, declined to comment.
Shanghai's A share index surged 9.94 percent on Monday, partly on speculation that Beijing was considering opening the A share market. It consolidated down 1.02 percent on Tuesday on a technical correction.
Analysts said a major problem is the Chinese yuan. While convertible on the current account since December 1, it is still a long way from full convertibility, and officials have given no hint as to the timetable for making it convertible.
""Solving the convertibility issue is a major obstacle,"" said a broker with a Chinese brokerage.
""There are also no definite candidates for establishing the funds. In the initial stages, the impact will be more psychological than real,"" said the broker.
An analyst with a foreign brokerage in Shanghai said the Chinese would probably seek to establish joint ventures with U.S. firms in the initial stages to learn from the highly developed and sophisticated U.S. mutual fund industry.
Without convertibility, it is unclear how foreign money will be exchanged for yuan to invest in A shares, and how funds being retrieved by foreign investors would be shifted back into foreign currency, analysts said.
""The key issue is how much liquidity from the funds the authorities will allow to be invested in the markets,"" said Xu Zhiling, deputy general manager of the securities trading department of China Guotai Securities.
Traders said introduction of joint venture funds would help stabalise the highly-volatile A share markets and create a secure vehicle for long-term investment.
""Funds from developed countries are often very large, seeking long-term investment,"" said a broker with China Finance Trust and Investment Co. ""Their entrance into the market will alleviate a trend of excessive speculation.""

1613,"Shares in debt-mired Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel SA fell on Tuesday after they were requoted following a week's suspension, amid disappointment over terms of its restructuring with creditor banks.
The troubled Anglo-French company unveiled on Monday details of the refinancing its 69.6 billion francs ($13.50 billion) of junior-ranked bank debt after a year of complex negotiations with bank lenders.
The shares were trading at 8.50 francs at 1052 GMT, on heavy volume of 16 million. They were 9.15 francs when they were suspended on September 30.
Analyst Jean Borgeix at broker Pinatton said the stock market was disappointed with the 10.40 francs for which the banks will getting new Eurotunnel shares in an eight billion franc equity for debt deal.
The market had been looking for a conversion price of between 12-15 francs per share, he said.
The current shareholders also stand to effectively ""lose"" 30 percent of Eurotunnel's future cashflow, as this is the percentage earmarked for paying the ""stabilisation notes"" it would issue to banks in return for an interest-free credit line.
The company negotiated the right to issue the stabilisation notes in case it fell short of cash to meet interest payments. It can issue up to 14.8 billion francs of the notes.
Factoring in that loss of future cashflow gave the shares a present value of around 8.5 francs per share.
Another French analyst said, ""The restructuring assures the industrial viability of the project, even though the shares remain a risky investment.""
The debt deal looked good on paper and the zero-interest stabilisation notes provided Eurotunnel with a last line of defence if its cash failed to meet interest payments, he said.
A trader at a major U.S. brokerage in Paris said the share price suffered from the dilution of equity due to the debt pact.
The restructuring will dilute the holdings of current shareholders to 54.5 percent of the capital after the debt swap.
The complex agreement also includes issuing eight billion francs of bonds redeemable in shares, which could further dilute the equity holders to 39.4 percent if the banks exercised their conversion rights at 12.40 francs per share.
But shareholders will also get share warrants at the same price to bring them back to owning 51.3 percent of the capital.

1616,"French holding company CGIP said on Tuesday it was buying 20 percent of car parts manufacturer Valeo, solving a problem which has occupied the government, France's car makers and Italian businessman Carlo de Benedetti.
Cerus, a French investment firm controlled by de Benedetti, sold the 20 percent stake to Compagnie Generale d'Industrie et de Participations (CGIP), for a sum which could total 6.7 billion francs, if Valeo hits 1997 profit targets.
The Valeo stake has been on the market for a year, as Cerus sought to raise cash to reduce debts, and sparked U.S. interest which set off alarms among European car makers. French industry minister, Franck Borotra, said he wanted a ""French solution"" for the Valeo holding.
But the Valeo purchase was made because ""it is good for our group, our shareholders and for Valeo,"" CGIP chairman Ernest-Antoine Seilliere told a news conference, explaining why his company chose to become the lead shareholder in Valeo.
The Valeo purchase was driven by CGIP's desire to rebalance its portfolio away from the packaging business, in which CGIP had 49 percent of assets following the acquisition of U.S. Crown Cork &amp; Seal shares last year in exchange for its interest in CarnaudMetalbox.
CGIP halved its stake in Crown Cork to 9.9 percent last month and with the 3.2 billion franc proceeds, helped pay for the holding in Valeo, which has significant growth potential, Seilliere said. These were ""parallel operations"" he said.
The question of keeping Valeo in French hands did not figure in its calculations. ""It's not our problem,"" he said.
CGIP wants Valeo to adopt a more generous dividend policy, pursue acquisitions more aggresively and use debt financing to leverage its financial results.
""We will ask for a payout of a third of the net,"" Seilliere said. Valeo has historically paid out 15 to 18 percent of net profit, while the average on the Paris stock exchange is 35 to 40 percent.
The CGIP move seemed to have borne fruit as Valeo said as part of the acquisition announcement it will make an exceptional 10 franc dividend later this month, for which Cerus would still be the beneficiary.
But Valeo's chairman Noel Goutard emphasised ""There is no change in direction,"" he told a separate news conference. The priority will be a ""strong and healthy balance sheet,"" and the company will pay particular attention to pursuing ""controlled and profitable growth,"" he said.
He added that Valeo had relied on its own resources in the past as Cerus did not want to see its 28 percent stake diluted in any capital raising in the markets.
With the new ownership structure, Valeo would be free to tap the markets for funds when it saw acquisition opportunities.
French car industry analysts said the deal was good news for all involved. Valeo had a solid partner in CGIP to develop on its own, even if this would not rule out a merger with another car parts firm in several years as the industry changed.
In the deal, Valeo, Europe's second largest car parts maker and a leading supplier of French and German carmakers, said it would make a 1996 dividend downpayment of 10 francs. Another payout of 10 francs per share would be made to Cerus if Valeo's 1997 net attributable profit hits 1.45 billion francs.
Shares in CGIP closed 3.93 percent higher at 1,190 francs while Valeo ended 2.64 percent. Cerus was down 7.29 percent at 127.10 francs.

1617,"The French government said on Friday it would reveal early in the New Year how it plans to sell the Thomson-CSF state defence electronics firm and that the sale would be covered by a 1986 privatisation law.
The decision, announced by the finance ministry, makes the sale process slower than if it had been carried out under another 1991 privatisation decree.
The independent Privatisation Commission earlier this month forced the state to rethink its plan to sell the Thomson SA electronics group in a private deal to the Lagardere Groupe conglomerate, when it objected to a key element in the disposal.
Following that setback, the state decided to privatise Thomson SA in two parts, with a sale of Thomson-CSF first, followed by Thomson Multimedia, the loss-making consumer electronics unit, to speed up the process.
But the complex sale details mean any decision will only be made in the beginning of 1997, government officials said.
The Council of State, France's highest administrative court, ruled that the Thomson-CSF sale is covered under the 1986 act, after the government asked it to rule on the legal framework.
The court said that as Thomson-CSF constitutes an essential part of the assets of Thomson SA, the sale should be seen as a means of privatising the parent company, the finance ministry said in a statement.
""The privatisation of Thomson-CSF is covered, just as that of Thomson SA, by chapter II of the law of 6 August 1986 on privatisations,"" it said.
A number of possibilities have emerged for Thomson-CSF since the Privatisation Commission derailed the sale process.
Thomson-CSF's chairman Marcel Roulet and its executive committee have lobbied the Prime Minister Alain Juppe for a stock market flotation instead of selling it to an industrial company such as Lagardere.
A flotation would preserve Thomson-CSF's independence and would be faster than a ""trade sale"", a source close to the firm said. The company has all the financial details to hand and 42 percent of its capital is already traded on the stock market.
Floating Thomson-CSF would allow a faster restructuring of the defence industry, which was the aim of the privatisation move. It could still form alliances with other groups, such as the planned merger between aircraft companies Dassault Aviation and Aerospatiale.
Thomson-CSF wants a ""clean"" flotation, without the traditional cross-shareholding pact which protects companies from hostile takeovers. A flotation would also ensure clarity in the sale terms, a senior source close to Thomson said.
But Lagardere chairman Noel Forgeard argues a flotation could lead to a break up of Thomson-CSF as members of any shareholders pact would want to buy up parts of the business.

1618,"French President Jacques Chirac looked set on Wednesday to achieve his ambition of creating a national defence giant to rival huge U.S. conglomerates through the planned merger of Lagardere's Matra with Thomson- CSF.
The government announced on Wednesday it preferred a bid by missile-maker Lagardere Groupe for electronics firm Thomson SA over a rival one by civilian engineering group Alcatel Alsthom. Both offers have been referred to the independent Privatisation Commission.
The preference for Lagardere seems to vindicates the integration sought by Noel Forgeard, chairman of Lagardere's Matra unit, who has fought a highly-public campaign for Thomson, in order to win its Thomson-CSF defence arm.
The deal will ""indisputably strengthen the missiles activity in France and particularly Europe,"" said Jean-Marc Baron, a partner specialising in defence at consultants KPMG Peat Marwick. ""The merger wil create a critical mass,"" he added.
Matra specialises in air-to-air missiles with the Magic and Mica weapons, while Thomson-CSF has ground-to-air missiles including the Crotale NG (New Generation) and Starstreak very- short-range missile built with Shorts Brothers Plc, a unit of Canada's Bombardier.
The addition of Thomson-CSF reinforces a vital joint venture between Matra and British Aerospace Plc to create Matra BAe Dynamics, which Lagardere wants to be the pole for future European industrial concentration.
Besides the missile synergy, Baron pointed to the benefits of marrying Thomson-CSF's radar and communications expertise with Matra's space satellites, which will give Thomson access to a new market.
Lagardere has major space interests with its Matra Marconi Space (MMS) joint venture with GEC Plc of Britain and also wants to use this a platform for building a single European satellite giant, to make the most of scarce funds.
This vertical integration of detection, communications and weapons makes the future Thomson Matra a powerful ""systems"" player rather than a seller of separate products. Each of these segments has annual turnover of about $1-$2 billion, Baron said.
In the United States, the defence industry has quickly consolidated through $40 billion of mergers and acquisitions to create giants such as Lockheed Martin. Integration is seen as key, with firms such as Hughes, a unit of General Motors, not only building missiles and satellites but also operating the satellites.
European and U.S. defence firms have had to adapt to shrinking military spending since the end of the Cold War and soaring research and development costs. But Europe has lagged in that restructuring due to differing national interests.
With the aid of Matra's links with BAe and GEC and through overtures to Daimler-Benz Aerospace (Dasa), Forgeard wants to forge a European grouping which would have world class status in terms of turnover and product range.
Chirac launched the privatisation of Thomson SA in February as part of a restructuring of France's fragmented defence industry, widely seen by analysts as a vital step toward a badly needed consolidation of European capacity.

1620,"France's national audit office criticised on Monday a lack of clarity and insufficient competition in the water supply market, dominated by two giant companies Cie Generale des Eaux and Lyonnaise des Eaux.
""There is a high degree of concentration. That is not to say competition is absent, but it is organised competition,"" said Francois Logerot, author of the Cour des Comptes (court of auditors') report.
""It may be that concentration in this sector is accentuated by agreements between these companies...sometimes by creating joint subsidiaries at the request of local councils.""
Logerot cited as an example the Saint-Etienne city council, where the water company Societe Stephanoise des Eaux is jointly owned by Lyonnaise des Eaux Dumez and Generale des Eaux (CGE).
The report, presented at a news conference, said the private sector held 75 percent of the supply of drinking water in France in 1991, up from 60 percent in 1980 and 31 percent in 1954.
The price of water rose by a national average 47.7 percent from 1990 to 1994, it said.
Significant price rises occurred where contracts were awarded to the private sector, Logerot said.
""Sometimes there was a catch-up effect but there were also excesses and abnormal situations.""
But CGE noted in a statement that the report said the main reason for rising water prices was higher quality and increasing investment needs.
It said the official audit pointed to a near doubling of the cost of water treatment between 1990 and 1995, while the price to the consumer rose by 30 percent.
Logerot said local authorities often awarded contracts to the water companies in exchange for payments which the companies then recovered in the price charged to customers.
The study followed a 1995 law which banned ""right of entry"" payments that water companies paid to win an operating licence.
The report cited the Alpine city of Grenoble, where a contract with Lyonnaise des Eaux resulted in the conviction for bribery of the mayor, former Gaullist minister Alain Carignon.
Grenoble used the proceeds of the water contract to finance its general expenditure, while accounting principles call for water expenses to be kept separate from the general budget.
Lyonnaise said in a statement that each water company had given details of its contracts to the audit office and, of the 12,000 in France, only about 20 had drawn explicit comment. And these had been agreed under conditions prevailing before the 1995 law.
The CGE statement said much of the criticism in the report related to the past, when payment for contracts was legal. It added that the company was pleased such payments had been banned and the duration of those contracts was limited.
CGE said the water market was highly competitive and 1996 had shown that, when contracts expired, there was competition to win new licences. The sector was also subject to strict controls by a number of public bodies, including competition and quality experts.

1630,"The European Airbus consortium said on Tuesday it was confidently pressing ahead with studies on a 555-seat passenger plane despite a decision by archrival Boeing to scale back work on a larger jumbo jet.
Boeing on Monday said market conditions did not justify the risk and expense of building a new version of its 747 jumbo jet, the 747-X, and it was diverting half the 1,000 staff on that project to smaller planes.
""We are confident the A3XX will meet market needs,"" an Airbus spokesman said. ""The signs from major airlines working with us on shaping the A3XX are definitely encouraging.""
Airbus, ever quick to seize on any perceived gaps in Boeing's armour, says airlines want an all-new plane rather than Boeing's 747-X, which the Airbus spokesman said was the ""end of the line for a product developed in the late 1960s"".
""Airlines want to fly into the 21st century facing forward, not backwards,"" the spokesman added.
Airbus must attack Boeing's monopoly on the large-capacity segment and is studying designs for an A3XX product family which it hopes to launch in 1998 for service in 2003.
It wants to grab at least half of the aircraft market by the end of the decade, up from its estimated historic share of 35 percent. But it lacks large planes to compete with Boeing's 777 giant twinjet and the best-selling 747 jumbo.
The four-nation consortium differs with Boeing over the potential market and development costs for a new large plane.
Airbus forecasts a market of 1,383 planes seating more than 400 passengers over the next 20 years, while Boeing believes demand would only stretch to 470 planes seating 500 or more, which would not allow it to get a return on its money.
A basic A3XX would cost around $200 million, giving potential sales worth more than $275 billion on the Airbus forecast.
""A split market would have been a big challenge for two manufacturers but now Boeing is opting out, that enhances our prospects,"" the Airbus spokesman said.
Airbus accepts the view that the market will fragment further as people want to fly more frequently, non-stop, long distance between city pairs.
The ""fragmentation"" effect was one of the factors cited by Boeing for cutting demand for larger planes and reducing the importance of big airport hubs.
But Airbus believes it will meet that market change with its A340 long-haul plane and that the A3XX will co-exist.
Saturation of air routes and airport landing slots calls for higher capacity planes, it argues. Countering critics who point to already lengthy waits at airports, it says its A3XX designs would allow a quicker passenger turnaround than the jumbo.
Airbus is talking to 14 leading airlines on what the plane should offer and is confident that it can match or better the airlines' operating demands. These include fitting within an 80 metre ""box"" at the airport terminal.
It is officially sticking to its estimated $8 billion development cost for the A3XX, despite scepticism among some experts that it cannot be done for less than $15 billion.
Airbus is a consortium made up of French state-owned Ste Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale, British Aerospace, Daimler-Benz Aerospace (part of Daimler-Benz) and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA of Spain.

1632,"Air France on Wednesday ordered 10 Boeing jetliners and 10 Airbus jets, and the government-owned airline reported dramatically improved profits of 802 million francs ($158 million) in the first half.
The profit estimate for the six months ending Sept. 30, disclosed in an Air France board statement, compared with a loss of 335 million francs ($66 million) a year ago.
The improved results and Air France's aim to break even in 1996/97 was underlined by the orders for 10 Boeing 777 twinjets and options for 10 more. The airline also ordered five Airbus A340s, confirmed five orders made in June and took options for an additional five.
Air France Chairman Christian Blanc won vital support from French Prime Minister Alain Juppe to buy from Seattle-based Boeing instead of ordering solely from its archrival Airbus Industrie, the European consortium based in southwest France.
At list prices, which are rarely paid, the orders and options for the Boeing 777-200 version ordered could be worth around $2.7 billion. Airbus would stand to gain $1.75 billion.
List prices for the B777-200 range between $128 million and $146 million, while the Airbus A340-300 costs $110 million to $120 million.
""In the reorganization of its fleet, Air France is obliged to buy Boeing,"" Transport Minister Bernard Pons told parliament.
""It is obliged to meet commitments made in 1989 unless it accepts losing deposits and taking legal action, which risks being much more expensive than making this decision.""
The French airline had outstanding Boeing orders worth $994 million and $2 billion in options, Pons said, adding that the airline had skilfully negotiated the latest order to respect the initial commitment.
The three government representatives on the Air France board approved the Boeing 777 purchase ""not because they are the best or the most profitable but because they best meet the company's needs,"" Pons said.
Air France had also accepted to be a launch customer for the planned A340-600, a ""stretched"" version of the A340, he said.
Airbus hopes to build the 375-seater to smash Boeing's monopoly in the large-capacity aircraft segment.
Air France said that, due to financial problems, it froze at the end of 1994 all aircraft orders, including the 1989 Boeing order, and opened talks with the two plane makers.
Air France has since reorganized its fleet, restructured its network around a centralized ""hub"" at Paris Charles De Gaulle airport and optimised aircraft use. It has over the past two years increased the number of flying hours by 14 percent.
Pons welcomed Air France's financial results, saying: ""The results are very encouraging.""

1633,"French aviation executives said on Tuesday they feared renewed turbulence with the United States over airline market access in France, with flagcarrier Air France caught up in a looming ""air war"".
The U.S. government wants France to sign a bilateral treaty which would grant more landing rights to American airlines, while Paris seeks a gradual market liberalisation.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. embassy in Paris told Reuters the U.S. authorities had not rejected the new winter schedule for state-owned Air France.
""However, Air France has requested increased services over last winter,"" she said.
""The Department of Transportation has extended the deadline to rule on Air France's request until October 27, thereby giving our government time to discuss the schedule with the French authorities.""
That delay on approving Air France's schedule was seen as a strongarm measure to force Paris into agreeing a new aviation treaty.
""It's like placing a dagger at our throat,"" an aviation executive said. Air France's winter schedule was due to enter service on October 27.
Air France has requested an extra flight to San Francisco, two to Los Angeles and one to Chicago this winter, compared to the 1995 winter schedule. It wants to add extra cargo capacity from March to Miami and Chicago.
A second French executive said if the United States took unilateral measures, Paris would not hesitate to retaliate against U.S. airlines, as it did in March when U.S. Transportation Secretary Federico Pena rejected Air France's summer schedule.
Paris cut landing rights of six U.S. airlines before the junior transport ministers of both countries, meeting in Paris, agreed to open talks aimed at reaching a treaty to replace one which expired in 1992.
Without such a treaty, each route and landing rights have to be negotiated on a case-by-case basis, whereas Washington would like a global, market-driven solution.
Separately, Washington is withholding approval of a planned alliance between American Airlines and British Airways Plc until Britain agrees an ""open skies"" treaty with the United States.

1636,"A restructuring agreed between Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel SA /Plc and bank negotiators on its 69.6 billion francs of debt was a ""robust"" deal, French co-chairman Patrick Ponsolle said on Monday.
He told a news conference the restructuring was robust as it would eliminate a total 16 billion francs of debt by swapping eight billion of loans into equity and a further eight billion for equity notes.
The plan secured the company's future until 2003, when the London-Folkestone high-speed rail link would be built, he said.
""After 2003 we will see an explosion of revenues from the railways,"" Ponsolle said.
The restructuring meant the interest bill would be fixed at 5.2 percent or 3.21 billion francs for the seven-year period. That rate was much lower than market rates, the company said.
If there is a cashflow shortage to repay interest, it will be able to draw down on stabilisation notes, which are effectively a credit line, free of interest until January 2006.
The plan also pushed back the debt repayment periods by a significant period, Ponsolle said. The resettable bonds mature in 2050, the participating loan notes in 2040, the remaining junior debt in 2025 and stabilisation notes in 2026.
Eurotunnel has also negotiated the right to refinance all its debt after 2004, free of penalties, to benefit from any improvement in market conditions. Previously, that refinancing incurred heavy financial penalties.
The deal had been worked out using a wide range of scenarios and sought to preserve the company's future and independence, Ponsolle said. ""It is the best compromise under the circumstances. The sacrifices for shareholders and banks are equal and equitable.""
The two chief aims of the deal were ""to preserve a clear majority for the shareholders and to ensure long-term financial stability,"" he said.
Although the company planned to pay a first dividend in around 10 years, if it performed very well it could make a payment at the date envisaged in the 1994 rights issue -- 2004.
Asked what would happen if shareholders rejected the deal, Ponsolle said, ""I think we would go back to the choices at the starting point. The starting point was either we come to a friendly agreement or insolvency.""
""I think, contrary to some, an insolvency could only be a catastrophe for the small shareholders.""
Prices should rise ""to a reasonable level"" following the merger announcement last week of P&amp;O and Stena of their cross-Channel operations, Ponsolle said.
The merger news had come as a surprise to Eurotunnel, which had not expected such a move until later, perhaps in 1997, he said.
The earliest Eurotunnel could hold a shareholders' meeting to vote on the deal would be late March or early April, he said.

1639,"The four partners of the Airbus consortium on Monday signed an agreement aimed at making the European plane maker a unified company better able to compete with Boeing Co.
In a statement, Airbus Industrie said its four European partners had signed a memorandum of understanding to restructure Airbus into a limited liability company by 1999.
""The establishment of Airbus Industrie as a single corporate entity (SCE) is an important initial step in the consolidation of the aerospace industry within Europe,"" Airbus said.
Toulouse-based Airbus is currently a partnership between French state-owned Ste Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale, British Aerospace Plc, Daimler-Benz Aerospace(DASA), and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA(CASA) of Spain.
The French and Germans both have 37.9 percent, the British 20 percent and Spanish company 4.2 percent.
The new entity will have a single management structure which should add control of engineering, testing, production, procurement and customer service to Airbus's current responsibilities for marketing, sales and product support, it said in a statement.
""Transfer of assets associated with these functions... will depend on how far the assets are essential for the described functions and their detailed valuation, to be completed by the end of 1997,"" it said.
""The ultimate objective is the restructring of the entire European (aerospace) industry, of which Airbus in one element and not the integrating entity,"" Aerospatiale chairman Yves Michot told the Le Monde newspaper.
""Airbus will be made a single company before the end of 1999 with a shareholding strictly the same as now,"" he added
Currently Airbus is mainly a sales and marketing organisation with the four partners manufacturing the planes.
Airbus first announced a preliminary agreement in early January. The four partners decided last July to turn Airbus into a corporation to streamline decision-making and production.
These restructuring plans took on a more urgent tone after Boeing and McDonnell Douglas said in December they would merge and form a civil and military giant with nearly $50 billion in annual sales.
Airbus said in its statement that the restructured company would facilitate continuing improvement in overall operational efficiency, the introduction of new international strategic partnerships and the longer term opportunity for ""external participation"" in Airbus.
Airbus spokesman Robert Alizart said that these options included a future stock market listing of Airbus.
Airbus said that the restructured company ""presented a great opportunity for business growth both for its existing shareholders and its future partners.""
It said Airbus was studying expansion of its product range with an aircraft in the 100 seat category, with Alenia  ALEI.RO of Itlay in co-operartion with AVIC of China and Singapore Aerospace.
It is also mulling derivatives of the four-engined A340, the A340-500 with a range of 8,300 nautical miles and the A340-600 with seating capacity of close to 400 seats.
In the high-capacity long haul market it is planning to launch the A3XX, which would break the stranglehold on the lucrative top-end of the market now held by Boeing's 747 jumbo jet.
Airbus is also pondering work on the Future Large Aircraft (FLA), a military transport aircraft to match the future needs of Europe, next to its civil work.
British Aerospace said it expected its wing development and production operations, employing more than 4,000 people, to be transferred to Airbus.
",PierreTran,1
1642,"European aircraft consortium Airbus said on Friday it had no evidence that archrival Boeing was putting pressure on U.S. suppliers to prevent them from working on Airbus' planned A3XX large plane.
Daimler-Benz Aerospace (Dasa) chairman, Manfred Bischoff, said on Thursday he was concerned Boeing and merger partner McDonnell Douglas were signalling to a big U.S. subcontractor, understood to be Northrop Grumman, not to work on the Airbus project, newspapers reported.
""We have no evidence of any kind of pressure,"" an Airbus spokesman said.
But an industry source close to Airbus said Boeing had put pressure on Northrop to stay out of the A3XX project, which threatens Boeing's lucrative monopoly of the high-capacity segment with its 747 jumbo. ""It is a fact,"" he said.
Dasa is a partner in Airbus Industrie, alongside France's Aerospatiale, British Aerospace Plc, and Casa of Spain.
Boeing was not immediately available for comment.
Airbus had been in exploratory talks with Northrop over supplying engine housing sections for the A3XX but those negotiations had ended, the industry source said.
Airbus has been looking for risk-sharing partners to supply up to 40 percent of the targeted $8 billion in the A3XX development costs. The plane would seat 550 passengers in the basic version, which it wants to enter service in 2003.
Airbus managing director Jean Pierson told journalists on Thursday at the Toulouse headquarters that he would lay out Airbus' competition concerns on the Boeing merger when he gives evidence to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the European Commission, as expected.
In the long term, the Boeing merger ""will pose a problem for Europe's civil aviation industry,"" he said, adding there would effects in military markets, particularly helicopters.
The industry source said the merged Boeing/McDonnell company would have bigger clout on suppliers, have a wider technology base though its portfolio of patents and gain larger access to indirect state funds for research and development through military programmes.
But Pierson said the merger was inevitable. ""The Boeing-McDonnell merger will go ahead,"" he said.
Airbus is determined to fight back and is holding to its aim of securing a half share of the world passenger plane market by the early part of the next decade. A niche player strategy was doomed to failure, as McDonnell Douglas and Fokker found out, he said.
The consortium needs to field products at the top and bottom end of the range, with respectively the A3XX and a 100-seater plane to be built with China and Singapore, as well as extend the A340 family of long-range jets to compete against Boeing.

1648,"Partners in European aircraft consortium Airbus must speed up plans to convert the partnership into a single company after news of a merger between its two U.S. competitors, an aerospace executive said on Sunday.
Boeing Co and McDonnell Douglas earlier announced a $13.3 billion merger plan which would create the world's largest aerospace firm, with 1997 sales of about $48 billion and employing 200,000 people, dwarfing rival Airbus.  
The merger meant Airbus's shareholders had ""to get their act together quickly,"" the executive said.
Airbus is a consortium made up of Ste Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale, British Aerospace Plc (BAe), Daimler-Benz Aerospace, a unit of Daimler-Benz AG and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA (CASA) of Spain.
The partners, who are also Airbus subcontractors, are in talks on how to change the grouping into a joint stock company from the present ""groupement d'interet economique"" (GIE) partnership. The aim is to create a more competitive and responsive organisation.  
""The need for the Europeans to integrate becomes more urgent,"" the executive said. The merger move showed ""the arguments (between partners) are trivial.""
BAe's group managing director John Weston has said the future Airbus should be a large, integrated company with design offices, manufacturing and sales functions, and have a solid balance sheet to finance aircraft sales, to better rival Boeing.  
But Aerospatiale's chairman Yves Michot has said he sees the new Airbus as essentially a large prime contractor, directing its suppliers' work, but retaining its design offices.
Some executives see the design office as the heart of the business, with the ability to create new aircraft. Aerospatiale's design office are in the southwestern city of Toulouse, next to Airbus headquarters.  
Eventually, BAe wants Airbus to be the civilian arm of a huge pan-European aerospace grouping, with a military wing to build future generations of combat planes, built from the national companies.
But for the time being, the partners also need to resolve differences over the valuation and transfer of assets.
Airbus declined comment. ""We can't comment on things happening in North America,"" an Airbus spokeswoman said.
Officials at Aerospatiale were not available for comment.  
The Airbus negotiations slowed over the summer, when the government moved then-chairman Louis Gallois to the helm of troubled state railway operator SNCF and promoted his number two, Yves Michot.
A memorandum of understanding was due to be signed by the end of this year setting out the main lines of the new company, but the industry executive said the talks are due to last through the winter, up to March 31.
U.S. broker Lehman Brothers has estimated Airbus could be worth between $15-18 billion after its conversion, based on historical and prospective financial data.  
Previous major consolidation moves in the United States between fierce rivals such as Lockheed and Martin Marietta, and now Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, showed all that was needed was the ability to look ahead and for the political will to exist.
The internal debate over the shape and scope of the future Airbus has run on for years, with managing director Jean Pierson a fervent enthusiast of an integrated company. The new Airbus company is supposed to be formed by the end of 1999.
Airbus expects to notch up firm orders for more than 300 aircraft in 1996, worth around $20 billion, compared to 106 sales last year, worth $7 billion. Boeing said it has received orders for 621 planes at the end of November.
The irony is that Airbus held merger talks with McDonnell Douglas in 1988, but the U.S. firm was stronger in those days and Airbus had not consolidated its position in the world market. The European company has historically held around a 30 percent share of the market, with Boeing around 60 percent and McDonnell 10 percent.

1650,"Ivorian 1996/97 cocoa arrivals picked up in early January, pushing the total to 640,000-650,000 tonnes by January 13, analysts and exporters said.
This was still down on the 730,000 tonnes recorded by January 13 last year.
The 1996/97 figure includes 50,000 tonnes of arrivals in the first three weeks in October as the season opened three weeks late.
""The problem now is that there is too much cocoa in the port,"" said one exporter with offices in Abidjan and San Pedro.
""Some exporters in San Pedro are slowing down (buying) because there is no storage space left.""
Sources close to the Caisse de Stabilisation marketing board gave an even higher arrivals total -- 707,000 tonnes by December 27, excluding the pre-season 50,000 tonnes. Exporters said the estimate was too high.
One exporter put arrivals lower, with 185,000 tonnes at San Pedro and 450,000 taken to Abidjan.
Other exporters put total arrivals at 555,000 tonnes by the end of December after 450,000 for mid-December.
""Cocoa is coming in at about 60,000 tonnes (a week) so there's a lot of cocoa about,"" said another exporter. ""Quality is still quite good with bean sizes averaging 95-97 (beans per 100 grams),"" he added.
Humidity levels were around 9-10 percent due to a lack of harmattan drying winds usually seen at this time of year, he said. Exportable quality is 7-8 percent.
Up country buyers noted, however, that humidity levels had already fallen from 11 percent noted in December.
""Bean sizes are around 95-97 per 100 grams but humidity is already down to 9-10 percent because of the sun,"" said one Gagnoa buyer, adding that the harmattan had arrived there.
National weather data showed no rains at eight out of 10 monitoring stations in the first 10 days of January. Rain at the other two was negligible.
Up-country buyers said bush tracks had now dried out after late-December problems and collection rates were normal.
""There is still a bit of cocoa out there and we expect February will be a bit better than usual,"" said Husseini Khaled, a buyer working around Gagnoa. ""As for the mid-crop question, we don't know yet,"" he added.
Buyers said they were paying at least the minimum recommended farmgate price of 315 CFA a kilo despite poor world prices and initially poor exporter offtake.
Exporters had originally said they would begin marketing a large coffee crop earlier then usual. ""Some people turned attention back to cocoa as coffee quality turned out to be terrible,"" said one exporter.
San Pedro exporters said they expected strong arrivals to continue at least into early February. Other exporters said they expected a late-January tail-off.
Shipping forwarders said warehouses were filling up but did not give precise warehouse figures. One source said at least 350,000 tonnes of cocoa had been exported since October 1.
""People talk of between 100,000 and 300,000 sitting as stock,"" said the port source. ""A middle figure would be a good working assumption,"" he added.
The industry's focus is now turning to final estimates for the mid-crop, which so far has been put at anything between 70,000 and 200,000 tonnes.
Pod counters were expected to complete up-country tours in January before firming up estimates.

1661,"Cocoa producers broadly agree on output management and have struck a compromise to unite against use of non-cocoa fats in chocolate in the European Union while accepting the change in other markets, Ivory Coast's commodities minister said on Monday.
""Europeans are rich consumers who can afford to carry on buying pure chocolate,"" Gauze, outgoing head of the Cocoa Producers Alliance (CPA) ministerial council, said on the sidelines of a two-day council meeting in Gabon.  
But Gauze added that world cocoa demand could rise by allowing use of vegetable fats in some countries.
""Residual markets needs dynamising,"" he said after palm-oil and cocoa producer Malaysia dropped its blanket acceptance of non-cocoa fat use as part of the compromise.
""Malaysia has moderated its position,"" he said. ""It has adopted the same line as the CPA.""
The ministers, who wrap up their meeting on Tuesday, were reviewing a 1993 International Cocoa Agreement and plans to cut member output by 90,000 tonnes by the year 2000.  
Gauze, current chairman of the International Cocoa Organisation Council, predicted that members would resolve differences over CPA output projections for the next three years by Tuesday.
""The differences are slight,"" he said after objections from Brazil, Ghana and Malaysia during preliminary talks among experts last week.
He said Malaysia had put forward a 1996/97 output proposal of 120,000 tonnes against a 130,000 tonne CPA projection. Malaysia's 1997/98 projection was 140,000 tonnes compared to the CPA's 137,000 tonne forecast.  
Gauze said Ghanaian and CPA projections for Ghana's 1996/97 output differed by only 20,000 tonnes.
""I do not want to leave here with any outstanding differences,"" Gauze said, adding that member output agreements were likely to be available late on Tuesday.
Gauze said efforts would continue to persuade the largest non-CPA producer Indonesia to join and to persuade Mexico to reconsider a decision to quit the alliance. Colombia would also be asked to join, he said.  
Ivory Coast, the world's top producer, has spearheaded opposition to European Union plans to allow use of up to five percent of non-cocoa fats in chocolate throughout the EU next year. It says this would cut demand for cocoa by 200,000 tonnes and harm cocoa-producing economies.
A Dutch study in September put the drop in demand at just 33,000 tonnes.  
Ministers from producing nations agreed in September at an ICCO meeting to cut output by 15,000 tonnes in 1996/97 and by 30,000 tonnes and 45,000 tonnes respectively in the two following seasons to balance world supply and demand and boost cocoa prices.

""The strategic issue for us was to win vertical control of raw supplies as there was a danger of others exporting for overseas revenue,"" group vice-president Martin Rushworth told Reuters in an interview.
The supplies from the plantations and factories, in which Blohorn now holds a 34 percent stake, total 190,000 tonnes of annual oil production, he added.
Ageing plantations on 36,000 hectares would be overhauled as some trees were nearing the end of their 28-year productive life and needed replacing at a rate of 4-6 percent a year.
""In some plantations trees have an average age of 22 years so there will have to be extensive replanting,"" Rushworth said.
Nine crop processing factories would also be refurbished over two years.
Palmoil prices (CIF Europe) averaged around $380 a tonne in 1993, $680 in 1994, $650 in 1995 and $540 in 1996, he said.
""Export prices are now around $560 a tonne but we think they will stabilise at around $540 a tonne in 1997,"" said Rushworth.
Blohorn's tender for leading stakes in the two state-owned Palmindustrie blocks were accepted by Ivory Coast and signed on November 28 and December 27.
Blohorn linked up with competitor SIFCA to complete the purchase along with the Belgian firm SOCFIN SA for its technical expertise in plantation management.
""Output will be used for domestic production of cooking oil and soaps with only consumer goods and refined oil for export,"" he said. Sites would sell palmoil to Blohorn at going-rate transfer prices and operate largely as separate entities.
Other Palmindustrie capacity of 40,000 tonnes was taken by the Belgian firm SIPEF with Ivorian SAFIPAR taking the remaining 35,000 tonnes.
Blohorn, whose main oil-based domestic brands are Dinor cooking oil and Savon de Marseille, bought three sites sold as two large blocks. Shareholders paid a total 64.5 billion CFA and took on 24 billion CFA in staggered government debt.
Palmoil processors are also seen as potential cocoa grinders but Rushworth said Blohorn would only do so from June to August to help with overheads during slack periods.
Ivory Coast's donor-sponsored privatisation programme saw 26 companies sold between 1991 and 1995 and another 10 in 1996.
Blohorn's main 34 percent shareholding is followed by Ivory Coast (30 percent), SIFCA (17 percent), village farmers (11 percent), SOCFIN (5 percent) and employees (3 percent).

1672,"Ivorian 1996/97 cocoa arrivals stood at around 390,000-410,000 tonnes by mid-December, after a slow start to the month, analysts and exporters say.
Exporters blamed a combination of crop profile and demand factors for the dip in December -- usually the strongest month.
The figures to December 16 were down from an estimated 540,000 tonnes by that date last year, but some analysts said a further 50,000 tonnes should be added to this year's total for comparative purposes as the season had opened three weeks late.
An averaged figure plus the 50,000 tonnes would put arrivals since October 1 at 450,000. Various sources put arrivals at San Pedro since October 1 at 130,000-140,000 tonnes with the rest going to the main port of Abidjan.
""Arrivals were slower than usual for December but in the past week arrivals have overtaken last year's (weekly) rate,"" said one exporter. ""People are completing December contracts but January will be strong,"" he added.
Subsequent arrivals up to December 22 were said by exporters to be around 50,000 tonnes per week. They expected the deficit in arrivals compared to last year to grow in December before narrowing sharply in January, when arrivals pick up again.
Difficulty in obtaining export contracts from the Caistab marketing board and problems with bean drying after rains upcountry had accentuated the usual Christmas period drop-off.
Rains had damaged bushtracks, delaying collection and raising humidity and moisture to above acceptable levels in some areas.
""We are refusing some cocoa. There is a lot more coming down now the sun is out,"" said one Abidjan-based exporter.
Drying problems and poor fermentation had raised bean humidity to 11 percent in some areas, extending both normal and machine drying times.
""Humidity levels are slipping back down from anything up to 11 percent,"" said one San Pedro-based buyer, and the guideline farmgate price of 315 CFA per kilo had on the whole been paid to growers.
Upcountry buyers visited by Reuters over Christmas had taken the chance to dry out large quantities of fresh through to greyish moist beans as a wet early December gave way to usual dry sunny weather ahead of the holiday.
""It's patchy, but sunny days are here again,"" said one buyer. ""Whatever was cut off in village stores or too wet can now be properly dried out,"" he added.
San Pedro received over 15,000 in the week from December 16, exporters there said.

1683,"Ivory Coast 1996/97 cocoa marketing season began on Thursday with the farm-gate price unchanged, the export tax lower, but confusion over freight rates.
Agriculture Minister Lambert Kouassi Konan told a news conference late on Wednesday that the farm-gate price would remain at 320 CFA francs per bagged kilo.  
Kouassi Konan, whose comments were broadcast on Ivorian state television on Thursday, said the Droit Unique de Sortie (DUS) export tax would be cut from 160 CFA francs to 150.
""To maintain the price, the government itself had to agree to a sacrifice of about 10 billion CFA francs, through the lowering of the Driot Unique de Sorti for cocoa,"" he said.
""If we had not made this cut we would have had to touch the price. The head of state insisted that the price of 320 CFA be maintained for our producers.""
Exporters had been expecting no significant price change.
Shipowners spoke of disagreements with officials over an indicative freight rate for 1996/97.
The Office Ivoirien de Chargeurs had requested detailed information on proposed freight rates on shipments for 1996/97, they said.
""We cannot give that kind of information now that markets have been liberalised. This is a part of our business strategy,"" one said.
""Normally (the Ivorian shipping industry forum) FEDERMAR would organise a meeting to discuss matters but we have been waiting.""
Kouassi Konan said the government had approved on Wednesday without amendment a decision taken by the Caisse de Stabilisation marketing board on the campaign.
Noting that the 1995/96 campaign was ending on Wednesday, he added, ""As a result, remaining stocks must be declared to the Caistab.""  
The opening of the season had been delayed by about three weeks. The government had given no explanation but some exporters linked the delay to the appointment only last month of new Caistab head Yves-Marie Koissy.
Koissy, who previously worked for the International Monetary Fund in Washington, has formally taken over but is not expected back in Ivory Coast until mid-November.
The 1995/96 season produced a record of around 1.2 million tonnes but a dispute over shipping rates blocked exports from early October to mid-November.
Export financers say bank liquidity was good with interest rates down on last year after Ivory Coast repaid some external debt.

A weather front expected to bring hot dry weather southwards over the whole of Ivory Coast had backtracked to the country's northern border with light rains taking hold in dried out areas.
""It has moved up to Korhogo (10th northern parallel) from Dimbokro (8th),"" said one weather analyst. Rains usually fall in a sweep 200 km to the south of the front's position, he added.
Crop analysts said the front's retreat meant no dramatic changes in cocoa pod development but they welcomed continuing rains.

An average of 30mm fell at ten weather stations monitored in the last ten days of November with heavy showers concentrated around Abidjan and Yamassoukro. In the preceeding ten days the average was 42mm, also boosted by heavy showers in Abidjan.
Overall November rains in three successive ten day periods rose from 104mm to 423mm before dropping to 295 mm in the last third of the month.
Light rains fell in Daloa and Man, after none in the first ten days of November. More southern cocoa belt areas received 53 percent of end-November average rains around San Pedro, and 62 percent around Gagnoa. Rains around Abidjan and Yamassoukro were 200 percent above average.
""November rains moved into surplus in the south towards the end of the month but we are still in deficit in the north,"" said a weather analyst.
Crop analysts said the latest weather picture was highly variable and mid-crop development would depend on December's pattern. Rains last year continued into December, they said.
""This year, dry weather up to early November slowed down mid-crop development but we could still be heading towards a reasonable crop,"" said the crop analyst.
""It is too early to draw conclusions as last year's weather picture was different,"" he said.  ""We had twice the normal rains for December but then a strong mid-crop.""
One crop analyst said on November 20 a long dry spell pushing into the year's short rainy season could slightly affect young cocoa fruits. The degree would depend on an extension rains seen since early November which would cushion the drying effect of Harmattan conditions, he said then.
Up-country buyers welcomed rains after dry weather in September and October but said drying problems had increased harvested cocoa humidity levels to up to 10 percent.
""Drying has slowed deliveries a bit, but overall quality is still good,"" said one.

1701,"In a move that would reshape the world medical device business, St. Jude Medical Inc agreed Wednesday to make four long-awaited, strategic transactions that would lift it into the top ranks of manufacturers of devices for regulating heartbeat.
The $665-million package of interlocking deals is costly and poses some risks, but likely will proceed, analysts said.
Shares in St. Paul, Minn.-based St. Jude traded down 1-1/2 to 37-1/8 after the announcement, while shares in other companies in the industry also fell.  
""There's a small chance this won't go through, and the Street is also concerned about dilution. But I think this is perfect timing ... It's an idea whose time has come,"" said Montgomery Securities medical technology analyst Kurt Kruger.
The main thrust of St. Jude's bold move is an agreement to buy Ventritex Inc in a stock swap valued at $505 million. Ventritex, of Sunnyvale, Calif., is the smallest of three companies that dominate the fast-growing, $500-million world market for implantable defibrillators, or ICDs -- electronic devices implanted in the chest and connected to the heart by wires to keep it from beating too rapidly.  
To resolve some long-standing legal actions and help free Ventritex from cross-licensing restrictions that have hobbled it for years, St. Jude is making three smaller deals.
The company agreed to buy certain assets from Telectronics Pacing Systems, a unit of Australia's Pacific Dunlop ; to acquire Medtel, an Asia-Pacific medical goods distributor also tied to Pacific Dunlop; and to buy certain intellectual property rights from the Intermedics unit of SulzerMedica, owned by Swiss medical giant Sulzer AG.
""Part of the brilliance of this deal is bringing all these parties together,"" said Piper Jaffray analyst Arch Smith.  
St. Jude is the world's largest maker of heart valves, markets for which are growing, but slowly.
In search of growth and risk diversification, chief executive Ronald Matricaria engineered St. Jude's 1994 acquisition for $500 million of the Pacesetter Inc unit of Germany's Siemens AG. The deal transformed St. Jude into a leading manufacturer of heart pacemakers.  
Since then, rumors have swirled that St. Jude might acquire Ventritex--a deal seen by many analysts as setting a capstone on Matricaria's efforts. ""If he pulls this off, it's the highlight of his career,"" said J.P. Morgan analyst Michael Weinstein.
Even with St. Jude's careful efforts, analysts said legal action could ensue. The other two main players in the ICD market -- Medtronic Inc and Guidant Corp -- could seize the chance to drag St. Jude into the courtroom.  
Shares in Minneapolis-based Medtronic were down 7/8 to 63-3/4, while shares in Indianapolis-based Guidant were off 2-3/8 to 41-3/8. Analysts said both fell on a perceived competitive threat from the St. Jude-Ventritex combination.
""Medtronic's world is getting more competitive, but I think they're less vulnerable than Guidant ... A hard rain is going to fall on Guidant,"" Kruger said.
Acquiring Ventritex promises to cut into St. Jude's future profits. UBS Securities analyst Samuel Navarro estimated 1997 earnings could be reduced by 10 to 15 percent.
Analysts disagreed on whether 1998 earnings would show a neutral, positive or continued negative impact from the deal.
St. Jude earned $129 million, or $1.71 per share, on sales of $723.5 million in 1995. The pre-merger First Call consensus of Wall Street analysts' estimates projected St. Jude earnings of $1.85 per share in 1996 and $2.19 per share in 1997.
""""One of the reasons the stock is off is uncertainty over 1997 earnings ... It's very difficult to say what St. Jude's earnings will look like in 1997 in the wake of this. But if you look into 1998 and beyond, it's powerful,"" Smith said.

1711,"The growing attractiveness of the subprime auto lending market was underlined again Monday when Olympic Financial Ltd said it had received expressions of interest from more than one potential acquirer.
Olympic expects to get a formal acquisition offer ""within the next several weeks,"" said spokeswoman Jennifer Weichert.
The company's stock price shot up 6-1/4 to 23-7/8 in heavy trading Monday amid speculation of a buyout.
""We don't have an offer on the table ... and we don't have a price,"" Weichert said.  
She also declined to identify those expressing interest in buying Olympic. But she said, ""Generally the kinds of companies that would look at a firm like this are other finance companies or regional banks or a conglomerate.""
Two major regional bank companies have waded into the subprime auto lending market via acquisitions in the past year. KeyCorp bought AutoFinance Group Inc last September, and Southern National Corp is in the process of buying Regional Acceptance Corp.
""It's partly the banks saying they want to recapture this market share,"" said Robison-Humphrey analyst John Coffey.  
Minneapolis-based Olympic, as with other subprime lenders, makes loans to borrowers with credit histories classified as weak or on the average- to lower-end of prime.
""These companies exist today because the banks have been unable to serve these markets ... and because you don't need to be a deposit taker to make auto loans,"" Coffey said.
Returns on well-managed subprime car loan portfolios can be strong and attractive to banks, he said.
Earlier this year, the Consumer Bankers Association warned of pitfalls in the subprime business and cautioned banks against jumping headlong into this growing market.  
Analysts said banks that could be interested in Olympic include KeyCorp, Norwest Corp and BankAmerica.
Also mentioned by analysts as a possible suitor was the GE Capital unit of General Electric Co.
Whoever the buyer, Coffey said, Olympic is ""intent on selling this company.""
He suggested the price could go higher than the $30 per share that other analysts set Monday as the likely top limit.
Trading volume in Olympic shares Monday was triple normal levels. ""There's some people taking some bets that it's going to go,"" said Principal Financial analyst Bob Ollech.

1718,"United Airlines said Thursday it ordered 51 new airliners valued at $4.4 billion from Boeing Co. and Airbus Industrie, and although the lion's share went to Boeing, one industry analyst said the European consortium scored a big victory over arch-rival Boeing.
United said it will buy 24 narrow-body A319 aircraft from Airbus. The order is valued at $900 million based on manufacturers' list prices, but United will likely pay much less thanks to special discounts.
United chose the Airbus planes over competing Boeing 737-700s and 737-300s after evaluating both, a UAL spokesman said.
""It certainly is a big win for Airbus,"" said Peter Jacobs, aerospace analyst at Ragen MacKenzie.
Boeing hardly walked away empty-handed, as United said it will buy 27 new wide-body planes -- 19 747-400s, six 757s and two 777s -- from the Seattle-based aircraft manufacturer.
The Boeing order is valued at $3.5 billion based on list prices. But again, United spokesman Joe Hopkins said, ""We're not paying the retail price.""
Jacobs said United may have won discounts from Boeing and Airbus of 10 percent to 15 percent off list price.
The new wide-body planes will replace older Boeings in United's fleet, said the airline, a unit of Chicago-based UAL Corp.
Boeing has been flooded with orders for new aircraft over the past 18 months. That may have made the manufacturer less willing to offer rock-bottom prices to beat Airbus for the narrow-body planes, Jacobs said.
""Boeing may have been more willing to walk away from an order than it would have been earlier,"" he said.
Airbus initially sold United a fleet of narrow-body A320s in 1992 by offering the airline deep discounts and an unusual walk-away lease arrangement.
""What that did was it got Airbus planes into the United fleet. That made this next decision for United easier,"" Jacobs said.
United will likely need to order another 100 narrow-body planes over the next seven years to update its fleet, he added.
United said the planes will be part of its ""retire and replace"" programme to update its fleet.
""By 2000, the programme is expected to generate more than $100 million in annual operating cost savings, reducing fuel, maintenance and labour costs,"" it said.
The programme will also ensure that United meets certain noise reduction requirements.
Delivery of all aircraft is scheduled to be completed by 2002, United said.
The carrier said it placed orders with United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt &amp; Whitney unit for engines for the Boeing aircraft and with International Aero Engines AG for engines for the Airbus jets. United Technologies owns 33 percent of International Aero Engines.
The Airbus A319s will replace United's older Boeing 737-200s, the airline and Airbus said. The new planes are configured to seat 126 passengers.
The A319 is a smaller derivative of the Airbus A320. United already operates 34 A320s and will take delivery of 16 more by the end of 1998, they said.
United joins German airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG as the largest airline customers for the A320 family, each with 74 planes.
Airbus Industrie is a consortium made up of French-owned Societe Nationale Industrielle, British Aerospace Plc, Daimler-Benz Aerospace, a unit of Germany's Daimler-Benz AG, and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA of Spain.

1721,"Major retailers reported mixed results Thursday for the crucial holiday sales season, sparking a drop in their stocks on Wall Street.
The preliminary holiday reports by J.C. Penney Co. Inc., Dayton Hudson Corp., Carson Pirie Scott &amp; Co. and others are ""further confirmation that the holiday was one of moderate growth,"" Morgan Stanley retailing analyst Bruce Missett said.
""There's a lot of nervousness about retailers and what they're going to report. It's definitely taking a toll on the stocks,"" said UBS Securities retailing analyst Annie Erner.
J.C. Penney said sales for the four weeks ended Dec. 28 were close to the Plano, Texas-based company's goals but that markdowns were higher than expected.
Total sales, including drug store sales, for the period were $3.6 billion, a 23.2 percent increase from the $2.9 billion in sales for the comparable period in 1995.
Same-store sales at J.C. Penney, not including drug stores, for the holiday period increased 6.2 percent over 1995. The company did not release dollar figures for same-store sales, which cover stores open at least a year.
The company also said it expected fourth-quarter earnings before charges would not meet Wall Street expectations and that profit margins for November and December were below planned levels.
J.C. Penney stock dropped $1.25 to $47.50 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Dayton Hudson said same-store sales at its 65 department stores in the Midwest, 736 Target discount stores nationwide and 300 Mervyn's discount stores in the West and South were up 4.2 percent for the same period. The Minneapolis-based company did not give dollar figures.
""Results at Target and Mervyn's for the four weeks were on plan, while department stores sales were below our expectations,"" Chief Executive Bob Ulrich said in a statement. ""With the shorter selling season this year, we planned our sales conservatively and generally met our plans for the season.""
Dayton Hudson department store sales increased 0.3 percent, Mervyn's sales decreased 4.1 percent and Target sales rose 7.1 percent, the company said.
Dayton Hudson stock fell $1.375 to $37.875 on the NYSE.
Carson Pirie reported a 12.8 percent increase in sales to $194.1 million for the four-week period. Same-store sales rose 7.6 percent.
""The sales results during the 1996 holiday season were in line with my expectations,"" Chairman Stanton Bluestone said in a statement.
But the Milwaukee-based company, which operates 53 department stores and four furniture stores, said it expected five-week sales results for fiscal December will fall slightly below those for the five-week period ended Dec. 30, 1995.
Carson Pirie and Dayton Hudson expect to report five-week results next week.
Last Friday, Seattle-based Nordstrom Inc. warned that holiday sales would decline from year-ago levels and that earnings would be below Wall Street estimates.
The reports put retail analysts on edge, but they remained confident that other big names, such as Chicago's Sears Roebuck and Co., May Department Stores Co. of St. Louis, and Federated Department Stores, of Cincinnati, would meet or exceed expectations.
""My impression is that May did okay. Federated looks like they're on plan and for Sears, we're looking for a good fourth quarter,"" said Brown Brothers Harriman analyst Joseph Ronning.
A big factor in the mixed sales performance for the holiday season was the fact that it was five days shorter than the previous year since the Thanksgiving holiday was later.
""None of us knew what this five fewer days would do ... to the mechanics of the season,"" said Morgan Stanley's Missett.
The net result was that most big sales gains were restricted by the shortened season, while mediocre showings were made worse by it, analysts said.
""You came out with a trend line not dissimilar to what we've seen all year, which is modest growth,"" Missett said.
Carson Pirie's stock dropped 25 cents to $25 on the NYSE. Among other retailers, Sears dropped $1.25 to $44.75 and May fell $1.25 to $45.50, both on the NYSE.

1724,"Monsanto Co. said on Monday it will spin off its chemicals business in a long-awaited and costly move that will allow the company to focus on its faster-growing agriculture, food and healthcare units.
Between 1,500 and 2,500 jobs will be eliminated in the transaction, causing the company to take a $400 million to $600 million fourth-quarter charge against earnings, it said.
""What they're trying to create is one company that's clearly focused on growth and one that's clearly focused on efficiency,"" said Smith Barney industry analyst James Wilbur.
St. Louis, Mo.-based Monsanto is a far-flung conglomerate whose varied products include Roundup weed killer, NutraSweet sweetener, carpet fibers, and drugs for treating arthritis and insomnia, as well as genetically engineered corn and soybeans.
Wall Street had long expected the giant company, which has about $8.9 billion in annual sales, to break itself up.
""It was a fait accompli,"" Wilbur said. ""The market likes companies that are less diversifed.""
The pared-down Monsanto will focus on its higher-profit margin agricultural, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology businesses, a spokesman said.
The new chemicals business will have to emphasize production efficiencies in a market subject to cyclical sales trends and intense global competition, analysts said.
""After careful consideration, we're convinced these businesses must operate separately to reach their maximum potential and thereby unlock significant value in both,"" Monsanto Chairman Robert Shapiro said.
Shapiro will head the post-spin-off Monsanto and Executive Vice President Robert Potter, who runs the chemicals business, will run the new company, still unnamed, Monsanto said.
The scope of job cuts coming with the spin-off has not been determined, but more details will likely be available by the end of January, a spokesman said.
Monsanto employs 28,500 people around the world. The anticipated cuts would reduce that headcount by 5 percent to 9 percent, the company said.
The tax-free spin-off proposed would create a new firm by the end of 1997. Current Monsanto shareholders would keep their Monsanto shares and get shares in the new concern as a special dividend, the company said.
Monsanto said its directors approved the spin-off.
The company also said the exact amount of the after-tax charge, which is to cover the costs of job reductions, asset and equipment write-offs, and consolidation of some manufacturing and offices, would be fixed at a later date.
Analysts estimated the one-time charge would total between 80 cents and $1 per share.
Monsanto, which reported 1995 profits of $739 million, or $1.25 a share, is expected to post per-share profits for 1996 of $1.50, according to First Call, which tracks analysts' projections.
Monsanto said in October it was considering options for its chemicals business, which had about $3 billion in 1995 revenues but is growing less rapidly than other units and is subject to more ups and downs.
""Chemicals would hurt the multiple of the company if they held onto it ... because the chemicals growth rate is not as high as the agriculturals growth rate and the earnings are more cyclical,"" said PaineWebber industry analyst Paul Raman.
The chemicals business -- making acrylic carpet fibers, plastic interlayers for glass, industrial phosphorus compounds and other products -- was shopped around for months, but no buyer was found, in part for tax reasons, analysts said.
Monsanto said the spin-off requires shareholder approval and clearance by government agencies and the Internal Revenue Service for it to be tax-free.
The spin-off is intended to be completed no later than the end of next year. Until then, the two companies will operate separately within Monsanto beginning early next year, it said.
Monsanto's stock slipped 37.5 cents to $40.75 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

1730,"Merger synergies that were supposed to carry Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Inc through a dry spell in its new product pipeline are not being realized as planned, raising questions about the drug giant's short-term future.
Shares in the barely one-year-old Swedish-American concern fell 6-1/2 to 34-7/8 on Friday after it said its third-quarter profits would be well below Wall Street estimates.
""This clearly indicates that the merger is not going as smoothly as hoped. I think this is a wake-up call for the company,"" said independent drug industry analyst Hemant Shah.  
Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn, formed through the merger of Sweden's Pharmacia AB and Kalamazoo, Mich.-based Upjohn Co, formally began operations in November, 1995.
""There's a cloud over the beginning of 1997. There's no earnings guidance,"" said Rodman &amp; Renshaw analyst Mario Corso.
In a conference call on Friday, the company said the merger is on track and cost savings of $500 million by 1998 are still projected. It said the merger has reduced the work force by 3,000 people to date. But the company earlier blamed ""the usual short-term disruptions seen in a multinational merger"" in part for its third-quarter earnings disappointment.  
""The problem is they're not realizing synergies as they thought they would,"" said Mehta &amp; Isaly analyst Steve Lisi.
Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn blamed the third-quarter earnings shortfall chiefly on currency translations. It said foreign exchange -- especially involving the Japanese yen, Italian lira and Swedish krona -- reduced quarterly sales by two percent and increased the cost of goods sold.
Limits to the company's currency hedging activities were blamed by the company for the foreign exchange hit. These inadequacies, coupled with an ongoing sales force transition, can be traced to the merger, analysts said.  
Merger programs are progressing, but the combination may never realize the synergies hoped for, Corso said.
That could compound another problem. Several of Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn's top drugs face competition from generic equivalents and few new products are in the pipeline, analysts said.
Xalatan for glaucoma and Camptosar for cancer are rolling out and could give the fourth quarter a boost. The company said it expects earnings for the fourth quarter and the full year to exceed year-ago levels. It also said it anticipates profit margin improvement through 1997.
But analysts were uncertain about the near-term outlook. They said the company offered no specific guidance on the conference call for 1997 earnings levels.
""They were hoping that through this merger they would realize synergies to ride this out ... We just don't know if they can do it,"" Lisi said. ""They'll get through these next couple of years, but it's going to be ugly.""

1731,"TheraTx Inc does not expect the federal government to implement new guidelines for certain key Medicare reimbursement rates until the summer of 1997, postponing until then any likely damage to the health care services concern's profitability.
""It's a government reimbursement change which is forthcoming. It will definitely pressure our earinings, there's no doubt about it,"" chief financial officer Donald Myll said in an interview.  
Like other companies that provide rehabilitation services to patients mostly in nursing homes, TheraTx has been waiting for two years for action from Washington on the reimbursement issue.
The company's stock has been depressed during that time by a market unjustifiably focused on one issue, Myll said following a presentation to investors at a Robinson-Humphrey conference here on Tuesday.
""At this point, I'd rather have bad news on salary equivalency than what we have now, which is no news,"" Myll said, referring to the issue.  
Public since 1994, Alpharetta, Ga.-based TheraTx operates 29 nursing homes and provides rehabilitation services on contract to dozens of other nursing homes companies. The firm also runs several occupational health clinics.
The rehabilitation division provides about 45 percent of revenues and offers three main forms of therapy: speech, occupational and physical.  
Most revenues in the rehabilitation area come from Medicare, the federal healthcare program for the elderly. The U.S. Health Care Financing Administration, which oversees Medicare, has been rewriting its reimbursement rules for speech, occupational and physical therapy since October 1994.
If HCFA proceeds with its latest set of reforms, TheraTx could see 1997 earnings come in flat to down compared to this year's level, Myll said.
Much remains to be determined, however, he said. Moreover, despite market concerns, the potential earnings hit from the changes is not large enough to hurt TheraTx seriously, he said.  
""There's no real threat. It's a one-time pricing issue.... The market has no clue on this,"" Myll said.
TheraTx on Tuesday reported third-quarter profits of $0.29 per share, up from $0.26 per share a year ago. The First Call consensus earnings forecast for the third quarter was $0.30 per share.
""The general performance of the company is on track. Whether (1996 per-share net) is $1.17 or $1.12 is not for me to say...but I would guess that analysts are probably going to revise their estimates downward because the third quarter was a couple pennies below the consensus,"" Myll said.

TheraTx shares closed Tuesday up 3/8 at 10-1/2.

1740,"Outboard Marine Corp said it is only five percent finished with a radical restructuring that it expects will result in more charges against earnings in 1997 and possibly in 1998, the company said.
Restructuring is about ""five percent complete as far as going down the road and getting the savings,"" said spokesman Stan Main. ""That does not mean that we've taken only five percent of our restructuring charges ... There will likely be more charges during '97 and perhaps even into '98.""
Shares in Outboard on Friday were off 1/4 to 15-3/4.  
The Waukegan, Ill.-based maker of boats and boat engines reported fourth-quarter profits Thursday that, excluding restructuring charges, beat Wall Street estimates.
Analysts cautioned, however, that a turnaround at Outboard remains a long-term project.
""They're going to be continuing this restructuring process in '97 and they're going to continue to have some more charges ... They describe the phase they're in now as the discovery process,"" said Lehman Brothers analyst Harriet Baldwin.
A key moment could come Tuesday when Outboard executives are scheduled to meet with analysts and investors in New York.  
Expected to be in attendance are the principals of Greenway Partners, an investment firm led by former Carl Icahn associates Alfred Kingsley and Gary Duberstein. Greenway bought an 8.5-percent stake in Outboard this summer.
Although the firm is known for activism, Greenway so far has not pressured Outboard to alter course, Main said. Nor has there been further communication between Greenway and company executives since initial discussions in August, he said.
Analysts speculated there could be fireworks next week or at the January 16 annual meeting of shareholders, who are said to be growing impatient for a cohesive recovery plan.  
A restructuring was set in motion this year by chief executive Harry Bowman, who came aboard in 1995, when the stock was trading in the low 20s. Bowman continues to deliberate over how to fix Outboard and key pieces remain to be put in place, analysts said.
The business is under evaluation from top to bottom, Main said. Once restructuring is complete, Outboard ""certainly will be a marine products company,"" he said.  
""Longer term, we could get into products that would not be marine related. But our initial focus over the next two to three years is to fix the business that we're in and then perhaps look at other areas that might be less cyclical or seasonal,"" said Main, who is director of strategic planning.
Bowman has spoken of finding more stability for Outboard, which suffers more from boating's boom-bust cycles than rivals, such as Lake Forest, Ill.-based Brunswick Corp, which has diversified into bowling, fishing and camping gear.
Outboard sees opportunities to enter other markets -- such as motorcycles, snowmobiles and personal watercraft -- via its innovative FICHT fuel injection engine technology, Main said.
Spending on capital and tooling in fiscal 1996, ended September 30, fell to $52.7 million from $66.5 million the year before, but spending on FICHT is holding steady as the company converts more of its engine line to it, he said.
Sales of 150-hp FICHT engines to dealers will begin in December and consumers will see the engines in January. A promotional roll-out is underway.
The company plans to convert its entire outboard engine line above 20-hp to FICHT engines, which will cost 22 to 25 percent more than their traditional equivalents, Main said.

As a result, analysts who had looked for Heartport to turn its first profit in 1999 are now talking about 1998.
For its part, the company plans a U.S. launch of its port-access surgical system in mid-1997. ""That's about a year earlier than we had previously expected,"" said chief executive Dr. Wesley Sterman in an interview with Reuters.

""We're targetting having 30 surgical teams trained by the end of the year, then drastically increasing our training capabilities over the next six to 12 months,"" Sterman said.

The Hong Kong Preparatory Committee, a group hand-picked by Beijing to chart the British colony's return to Chinese rule on July 1 next year, chose 340 members of the Selection Committee from a list dominated by pro-China politicians.
The 400-member Selection Committee would make the final selection of the first post-colonial chief executive in a meeting on December 11 in Hong Kong, officials of China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office said.
""The 400 members of the Selection Committee are shouldering a great historic mission, I hope they willl not let down the trust of the nation and will not let down the hopes of six million Hong Kong people,"" said Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen.
The committee should chose a leader capable of maintaining Hong Kong's stability and prosperity, Qian said in a speech to the Preparatory Committee in Beijing's cavernous Great Hall of the People.
The Preparatory Committee meeting chose the 340 Selection Committe members from a prepared list of 409 candidates made up largely of prominent Hong Kong politicians, well-known businessmen and community leaders.
""I think this is a very broad-based representative committee,"" Chen Ziying of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, when asked why few democrats were in the group.
Preparatory Committee members select 340 of the 400 members. Of the remaining 60 seats, 26 automatically go to 26 delegates on China's National People's Congress, or parliament.
The other 34 members will be appointed by local deputies of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.
The Selection Committee will also choose a provisional legislature to replace the current elected Legislative Council on July 1, 1997.
Anxiety has grown in Hong Kong in recent months over how much political freedom China will allow after it regains control of a colony run by Britain for more than 150 years.
Democratic campaigners in the colony have accused Beijing of using undemocratic methods to shape its future government and have condemned the scrapping of the existing legislature.
China this week ordered two Hong Kong democratic activists to leave the country after they tried to deliver a petition to officials that criticised the selection method and called for a reprieve of the legislature.
Businessmen Peter Woo and Tung Chee-hwa and retired judge Simon Li, who are front-runners in the contest to become Hong Kong's chief executive after the handover, are members of the Preparatory Committee.

""What we don't want to do is let the CTBT die,"" Downer told a news conference during a visit to Beijing on Friday. ""An enormous amount of effort has gone into it, there has been a very wide measure of agreement on the text.
""We think the best way to take it forward is for us to ... take a resolution to the United Nations General Assembly in support of that text,"" he added.
Government officials in Canberra said Australia would lead the charge to win agreement for the treaty and would look for co-sponsors for a U.N. resolution to allow it to be opened for signing despite the failure to reach a consensus.
""We will work to achieve the treaty's endorsement during the current session of the U.N. General Assembly and its opening for signature at the earliest possible date,"" Downer said in a statement released in Canberra.
The 61-nation Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, which needed a unanimous stance to allow it to approve a draft text, on Thursday decided it could not even agree to report its failure to the General Assembly.
New Delhi, which had demanded nuclear powers commit themselves to move towards total disarmament, was able to block the treaty's progress singlehandedly -- prompting calls for a new way to be found to keep it alive.
Diplomats have said there is little time left for the 51st General Assembly to open the pact for signature at a ceremony in late September.
Australian ambassador for disarmament Richard Starr told Reuters in Geneva that Canberra still believed the treaty could be salvaged after nearly three years of negotiation and ""decades of expectations"".
""There is a clear need for friends of the CTBT to consider action so that the whole international community will be able to consider, endorse and sign this valuable treaty,"" Starr said.
""We would not want to see a treaty text die in a pigeonhole in Geneva,"" he said.
Australia, using its standing as a middle-ranking, non-nuclear power, has sought to play a leading role in the campaign to end nuclear testing.
Diplomats in Geneva said earlier this week the five declared nuclear powers -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- considered Australia best placed to present the draft treaty to the UN general assembly in the form of a resolution calling for a swift signing ceremony.
Downer said there was still some way to go to ensure the treaty's survival but expressed optimism a resolution would find widespread support.
""This is just the beginning of a process,"" he said. ""I think there will be very strong support for our move.""

1762,"Beijing accused the United States on Tuesday of pursuing hostile policies towards China and defended a campaign to boost patriotism as a shield against aggressive foreign forces.
""In the last few years the United States has pursued antagonistic policies toward China,"" said the official People's Daily, mouthpiece of China's ruling Communist Party.
""U.S. media circles have spared no effort to attack and sully China,"" it said as disarmament talks between Chinese and U.S. officials entered a second day in Beijing.
U.S. Undersecretary of State Lynn Davis began talks on arms proliferation in the Chinese capital on Monday, part of a visit seen as a vital step towards rebuilding ties long strained by disputes over trade, human rights, copyright piracy and Taiwan.
Both sides, however, say relations have warmed in recent months after a string of high-level meetings. But the Chinese state press has continued to issue harshly worded condemnations of U.S. policies and individuals seen as hostile to Beijing.
In an angry reaction to an article in the New York Times on October 24 by former U.S. ambassador to China James Lilley, People's Daily slammed the U.S. media for unfriendly reporting that was harming vital cross-Pacific ties.
In his signed opinion piece, Lilley wrote that the loss of communism's appeal in China had left a vacuum that was being filled by nationalist xenophobia, but warned that nationalism was a dangerous road to take.
People's Daily said no such warning was required.
""(Some Westerners) see Chinese people's patriotism as being narrow-minded nationalism that will be catastrophic for the West and must quickly be discarded,"" it said.
Over 100 years of abuse at the hands of imperial powers had taught Chinese how to be patriotic without straying into blind xenophobia, it said.
Washington's anti-Chinese actions did not stop at thwarting Beijing's bid to hold the 2000 Olympics or at U.S. threats over human rights, trade or nuclear proliferation, it said.
Chinese feelings had been badly hurt by outrages such as Washington's dispatch of two aircraft carriers to the seas near Taiwan in March, it added.
Washington sent the aircraft carrier battlegroups to monitor intimidatory war games and missile tests carried out by China near Taiwan in the run-up to the island's first direct presidential elections, a decision that infuriated Beijing.
""It is this kind of pressure from the United States and other Western countries that has inspired the enthusiasm of the Chinese people's patriotism,"" People's Daily said.
""This kind of intense spontaneous reaction to interference by foreign forces is an ordinary manifestation of the Chinese people's patriotism,"" it said.
""Only when the motherland is strong and prosperous can the interference and aggression of outside forces be fundamentally resisted and forestalled,"" it said.
Analysts say Beijing is keen to boost nationalist sentiment in China to fill an ideological vacuum caused by the rush from strict communist values to a market-style economy.
Repeated calls for more patriotism have been accompanied by repeated state media diatribes against the United States and by a mass campaign for a return to orthodox socialist values.

1766,"Australia's Foreign Minister Alexander Downer announced on Friday an agreement with China to expand their security dialogue, saying recent frictions had failed to spoil growing ties between the two Pacific powers.
Disagreement over Taiwan, a coming meeting with the Dalai Lama and Chinese concerns over a Canberra-Washington security pact had not spoiled the atmosphere during meetings with his Chinese counterparts, Downer told a news conference in Beijing.
""I have been able to develop a security dialogue between Australia and China,"" he said. ""What I would like to see happen is us holding, on an annual basis, senior officials' talks about regional security issues.""
Downer said an Australian proposal for broadening existing annual bilateral disarmament talks into such a dialogue had been accepted by Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, but he gave no details of how they were likely to be organised.
""It's symbolically important because it reaffirms ... that the Australian government does not support a policy of containment of China,"" he said.
Downer's coming meeting with the Dalai Lama, Beijing's arch-rival for the loyalties of the Tibetan people, had not been a sticking point in talks with Premier Li Peng, he said.
Beijing regards the Dalai Lama as an anti-China ""splittist"", and condemns all attempts by Tibet's supreme spiritual leader to gather international support for autonomy in the restive Himalayan region.
Downer said he would meet the Dalai Lama when he arrived in Australia next month, but said the Chinese premier had made no direct mention of the visit.
A defence pact in July between Washington and Canberra that raised hackles in Beijing had not been brought up as a Chinese concern, while a proposal to supply uranium to Beijing's rival Taiwan was far from becoming a reality that could disrupt growing ties, he said.
Australian officials said Downer had fulfilled a pledge made last month in Hong Kong to raise the case of jailed Chinese-born Australian businessman James Peng during his Beijing trip.
Peng, 36, was sentenced to 18 years in a Chinese prison last September after being convicted of embezzling about A$240,000 (US$180,000) in the southern city Shenzhen. He has insisted he was framed by powerful commercial rivals.
Downer had requested that China deport Peng before the end of his scheduled term, but had been told the prisoner's sentence was a matter for the judiciary to decide, officials said.

1778,"The goodwill generated by recent high-level visits may warm a Sino-U.S. presidential meeting this weekend, but lingering disputes mean the two leaders will still have much to talk about, diplomats and analysts said on Friday.
Chinese President Jiang Zemin's meeting with his U.S. counterpart Bill Clinton at a conference of the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in the Philippines would be a key chance to bolster recent progress in easing ties, they said.
A visit this week by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher had brought Beijing welcome signs of new U.S. flexibility on such thorny issues as weapons proliferation, trade and Taiwan, said a Chinese specialist on U.S. affairs.
""During Christopher's visit to China there was progress on all the issues,"" said Niu Jun of the North American foreign policy department of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
Both sides had acknowledged a need to boost contacts and exchange state visits, while Christopher had accepted that U.S. arms sales to Beijing's island rival Taiwan were a weapons proliferation issue, Niu said in a telephone interview.
The clearest sign of Washington's desire to repair the battered cross-Pacific relationship was U.S. willingness to consider starting peaceful nuclear cooperation even before a previously signed accord on the issue was implemented, he said.
""This change (on nuclear technology transfer) symbolised the change in the U.S. attitude,"" he said.
""There has to be a belief in the possibility of establishing fairly good relations with China in the future (for the United States to be willing) to transfer this kind of advanced technology,"" he said.
China is eager to buy nuclear reactors from U.S. firms equally keen to tap into its potentially large market, but cooperation has been stunted by U.S. fears that Beijing places few controls on the proliferation of nuclear technology.
While nuclear flexibility is controversial in Washington, mutual interest made nuclear cooperation the issue one that Washington and Beijing could use to ensure a recent improvement in ties did not falter, said a Beijing-based Western diplomat.
""I think that's the big carrot the Americans are trying to hold out for more progress on non-proliferation,"" the diplomat said. ""It's something the Americans would quite like to do anyway because there's money in it.""
While Christopher's visit had helped to boost ties in general, China was still likely to hold out for unilateral concessions from Washington on the terms of its accession to the World Trade Organisation, human rights and trade, he said.
""They don't really seem to have made a lot of progress,"" he said. ""I get the impression that there's still a lot of hard pounding to go.""
A U.S. desire to see more concrete commitments from Beijing before making concessions meant that the Jiang-Clinton meeting could end up achieving little of real substance, he said.
Taiwan, which Beijing has considered a rebel province since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, would remain China's main policy focus at the presidential meeting, said Niu.
""For China the most important issue is Taiwan...and the reaffirmation that (the United States) will not sell weapons to Taiwan,"" he said.
While China's stance on most Sino-U.S. bugbear issues was clear, Beijing was unlikely to give any public signal of its intentions on newer issues such as a U.S. push for tax-free imformation technology imports or other APEC proposals, the Western diplomat said.
""I think the Chinese are keeping their powder dry on all these issues,"" he said.

1785,"A huge ethylene venture linking a British Petroleum subsidiary and Shanghai Petrochemical Co Ltd would give BP a major presence in China's downstream petrochemicals, company officials said on Tuesday.
BP Chemicals signed a letter of intent with Shanghai Petrochemical on Thursday to set up a $2.5 billion plant in Shanghai capable of producing 650,000 tonnes of ethylene a year.
""It's a big step forward for our development in China,"" said Zhang Jianning, BP's Beijing manager of government affairs.
He said BP's biggest China project so far also marked a change of focus for the company, which has until recently concentrated most of its Chinese investment in upstream activities such as drilling and exploration.
Analysts have predicted huge growth in China's downstream petrochemicals industry, as booming economic growth sends demand for products such as ethylene soaring.
""At the moment I would think petrochemicals is getting quite exciting,"" Zhang said in a telephone interview.
Officials of Shanghai Petrochemical, which is majority-owned by China Petrochemical Corp, or Sinopec, said the huge project demonstrated the company's confidence in its own future and in China's economic development.
It was too early to say how long a feasibility study for the project would take, but for a project of such a scale preliminary research could reasonably last up to two years, said Shanghai Petrochemical deputy director Lian Xiaolu.
Completion of such projects could take up to eight years, Lian told a news briefing in Beijing, adding it was too early to decide the details of how the venture would operate or of the investment required.
BP will own a 50 percent stake in the ethylene plant with the remaining 50 percent either held by Shanghai Petrochemical or shared with its parent Sinopec, officials said.
The venture is one of six ethylene projects with annual capacity of 600,000 tonnes or more promoted by state planners, the official China Daily said.
Sinopec president Sheng Huaren said last week the state oil refiner planned to more than double ethylene production capacity to around five million tonnes a year by 2000 from the current annual 2.36 million tonnes.
Shanghai Petrochemical officials said they hoped to establish a joint venture company with BP to produce acrylonitrile, used to make synthetic fibres.
The joint venture could then be expanded if all went well with technical studies for the ethylene plant, they said.
""If the market is there we will go ahead very quickly on this one,"" BP's Zhang said. He declined to say when the British firm hoped to begin production.
While the letter of intent showed a major commitment to working with BP, even if the ethylene project developed it did not mean Shanghai Petrochemical would slow cooperation with other foreign firms, said board of directors secretary Cai Hongping.
""It's not like love with a marriage of one husband and one wife,"" he said. ""I think Shanghai Petrochemical will not stop looking for other partners.""

1786,"Chinese state media on Friday lashed out at a U.S.-funded radio news station, accusing the United States and other Western nations of stepping up ""Cold War propaganda"" against Beijing.
U.S. Radio Free Asia, which broadcasts news to China in Chinese, had been launched by Washington to create chaos and sow dissent in Asian nations, the official China Youth Daily said.
""With the broadcasts of Radio 'Free Asia', the United States is further stretching its gossiping tongue into the Asian region,"" the newspaper said in an article published on the same day a senior U.S. official began a visit in Beijing.
U.S. Undersecretary of State Lynn Davis had arrived in China for talks on arms proliferation and to lay the groundwork for a crucial visit later this month by Secretary of State Warren Christopher, a U.S. Embassy spokesman said.
Christopher's visit is intended to be the latest in a series of moves by Washington and Beijing to mend ties long strained by disputes over human rights, trade, copyright piracy and Taiwan.
Officials on both sides say relations have warmed in recent months after a string of high-level contacts, but articles in the Chinese state press on Friday took a more hostile tone.
""Although the Cold War has been over for years, the United States and other Western nations rely on the superiority of their communication and information technology to increasingly launch Cold War propaganda,"" China Youth Daily said.
""The real goal of setting up Radio 'Free Asia' is to use news media to interfere in the internal affairs of China and other Asian nations, to create chaos, and to destroy the stability of these countries,"" the newspaper said.
Radio Free Asia would only boost people's abhorrence of U.S. power politics and hegemonism, the China Youth Daily said, calling for Asia-wide vigilance against the station.
China last month told Washington to pull the plug on Radio Free Asia, created by the U.S. congress as an Asian counterpart to the anti-communist Radio Free Europe. But U.S. officials have said the local-language news broadcasts were here to stay.
The station announced on Thursday that it planned to begin beaming uncensored news to Tibet this month and to expand Chinese broadcasts next year.
U.S. commentators have suggested the station could become a new irritant in fragile cross-Pacific ties, particularly after U.S. congressmen reversed a change of name to the less contentious Asia Pacific Network.
Another potential stumbling block for Sino-U.S. reconciliation is the case of Chinese dissident Wang Dan, who was jailed for 11 years for plotting against the government after a trial on Wednesday that lasted less than four hours.
Beijing's human rights record has long been a major focus of U.S. concerns and a perennial source of dispute.
While the China Youth Daily focused on the pro-democracy rhetoric of Radio Free Asia, a separate report in the official Legal Daily took aim at the entire U.S. political system.
In a scathing analysis of the current U.S. presidential election, the newspaper said ordinary Americans had little say in the choice of their leadership.
""U.S. democracy is essentially democracy of the capitalist classes or democracy of the rich -- it certainly is not democracy of the whole people,"" it said.
Most voters chose not to turn out for mud-slinging contests between presidential candidates promoted by special interest groups, it said.
While some analysts see the Chinese media's anti-U.S. rhetorical broadsides as evidence of growing nationalist sentiment, Beijing officials say they are keen to mend fences with a nation also seen as a vital economic partner.

1790,"China on Sunday used a Long March 2D rocket to fire a scientific research satellite into orbit from a base in the remote northwestern province of Gansu, the Xinhua news agency said.
The successful launch of the remote-sensing satellite followed a string of setbacks for the Chinese space industry that have sent insurance premiums for commercial launches soaring.
""The satellite went smoothly into orbit and all instruments aboard are operating well,"" Xinhua said.
The launch of the satellite, which is designed to spend 15 days in orbit before returning to earth for retrieval, was the third successfully completed by the two-stage, liquid-fuelled Long March 2D rocket, the official agency said.
China's space industry, once much admired for its bargain prices and its strong track record of launch successes, has been plagued by problems in recent years.
In August, a domestic communications satellite launched aboard a Long March 3 rocket from Xichang in the southwestern province of Sichuan failed to reach its proper orbit.
In February, a Long March 3B carrying an Intelsat satellite veered wildly seconds after lift-off before exploding in mid-air near the Xichang space centre.
China said six people were killed, 57 injured and 80 homes destroyed in the incident. Video footage smuggled out of China by an Israeli scientist showed dozens of levelled buildings and suggested the casualties were higher.
Chinese officials said the loss of the rocket and its payload was caused by a failure of the ""inertia platform"" that operates the rocket's directional controls.
In January 1995, a Long March 2E rocket blew up, killing a family of six in a rain of debris and destroying the Hughes-built Apstar 2 satellite it was carrying.
The failures, although hardly exceptional in the high-risk satellite business, have sent insurance premiums for Chinese launches soaring, eroding China's price advantage over Western and Japanese competitors.
Several launch contracts with foreign companies were cancelled following the setbacks, partly because of concerns over delays due to China's launch backlog.
China says it still has a high success rate, with only a handful of the 43 launches carried out by its Long March rocket series going wrong, and officials said this month they had tightened safety measures to prevent further disasters.
Launch vehicles would now self-destruct in the case of failure and officials would ensure people living nearby are evacuated before each launch.
In July, China took a step towards restoration its reputation for reliability when it successfully launched the Apstar 1A satellite.

1796,"European record business executives on Friday sang the praises of China's crackdown on widespread copyright piracy, saying Beijing appeared sincere in its desire to build a legitimate music industry.
European companies were eager to establish cooperative ventures with local firms that would allow them to supply music to a vast listening audience currently largely supplied from illicit music production lines, the executives said.
""The Chinese market has enormous potential,"" EMI Europe President Rupert Perry told reporters in Beijing, adding that China was making progress in its crackdown on piracy.
Beijing vowed to clamp down on pirates and prise open its cultural markets in a June agreement with the United States that narrowly averted a multibillion dollar cross-Pacific trade war over violations of intellectual property rights.
Analysts and some industry figures have cast doubt on China's commitment to wipe out piracy, but the music executives said they had been encouraged by their talks with Chinese copyright and publishing officials.
""Our conversations with Chinese officials in the last couple of days lead us to believe that they are very cognisant of the problem and doing everything that they can to control it,"" said Perry.
""The laws are in place, they have an understanding of what has to happen and yes, they have had successes in closing certain factories,"" he said. ""We believe that will continue.""
The executives, who are part of a trade delegation to China led by European Commission Vice President Sir Leon Brittan, said they hoped to build an industry that would develop Chinese musical talent for a domestic and international audience.
The multimillion dollar Chinese music market had the potential to grow 10-fold over the next few years, industry officials in the delegation said.
""We... tried to explain to the Chinese what we could do together,"" said Polygram Far East president Norman Cheng, ""They have been pretty receptive to all these ideas.""
""This is our first round of meetings,"" said Michael Smellie, senior vice president of BMG Entertainment International Asia Pacific. ""We were encouraged.""
Music imports into China were still negligible, while pirate sales were estimated at $170 million a year, roughly equivalent to the value of legitimate sales, said Adrian Strain of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI).
European music companies were looking for Chinese partners to develop the local market, with former pirate firms among the potential wedding partners, the executives said.
While it was impossible to wipe out piracy with a single campaign, Beijing's crackdown on illicit production had worried illegal producers and had forced them to shift some production lines to Vietnam and even South America, IFPI officials said.

1797,"China's rising foreign debt should not cause anxiety because the economy is booming and foreign exchange reserves are bulging, financial analysts and economists said on Tuesday.
Beijing was being cautious about raising the level of its foreign debt despite strong demand for capital, they said.
Foreign debt rose 6.3 percent to $109.57 billion at the end of June from a year earlier, the State Administration of Exchange Control said on Thursday.
Total foreign debt was up by 2.8 percent, or $2.98 billion, compared with end-1996.
The growth in debt was lagging well behind the expansion of the economy in a sign that Beijing was retaining its tight grip on overseas borrowing, said a foreign analyst in Beijing.
""(The debt increase) is not out of line with the size of the economy... I wouldn't think it is an alarming number,"" he said.
The need to restrain companies hungry for capital and the traditional reluctance of China's communist leadership to be indebted to foreigners were partly responsible for Beijing's tight limits on debt, said a Hong Kong-based financial analyst.
""Basically, the growth in the debt has been very moderate over the last couple of years,"" he said.
Demand for foreign loans and investment has soared as China's economy has boomed and officials and businessmen have pursued ambitious infrastructure and development plans, but Beijing was reluctant to depend too much on foreign finance, the analyst said.
Healthy foreign exchange reserves that reached a record $95.0 billion by the end of September had given Beijing the ability to boost debt levels without damaging lender confidence, but also enabled it to limit borrowing by providing a separate foreign currency source, said the Beijing analyst.
""China tends to be more conservative in borrowing, that's the culture, and this is more on the conservative side,"" he said.
""There is capacity for them to borrow more...without worrying about the underlying fundamentals,"" he said.
A senior Chinese economist under the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation said the rise in total debt was a response to a slight reduction in foreign direct investment and the continuing demand for capital.
He welcomed the exchange administration's report that the proportion of debt held by foreign-funded enterprises had risen to 18.6 percent, compared with the 30.2 percent accounted for by government debt and a 39.1 percent share for financial institutions.
""It is difficult for foreign-invested companies to raise money in China, so it is normal for them to raise funds overseas,"" the economist said. ""China is not responsible for the debts of foreign-invested companies.""
State media said in June that China intended to borrow more abroad, but would also adjust the foreign currency structure of its debt to make it match exchange income and reserves.
The decision to expand the scale of the national debt had not weakened Beijing's administrative vetting of the quality of overseas loans, which remained strict, the analysts said.

1800,"U.S. mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments said on Saturday that Canadian regulators were investigating trades made by Veronika Hirsch, the star manager of their new Canadian equity fund.
Hirsch's 27-city road show to promote Fidelity's True North fund has been postponed as a result of the regulatory review, said a spokesman for the Boston-based mutual fund company.
The tour was scheduled to begin on Monday.
""Veronika Hirsch ... was recently contacted by a regulatory agency about her personal investments before she joined Fidelity,"" Chethan Lakshman, a spokesman for Fidelity's Canadian subsidiary, Fidelity Investments Canada Ltd., said in a telephone interview.
""At this time it is appropriate to postpone the tour and we're hopeful that the regulatory review of her trading activity will result in a favorable conclusion,"" Lakshman said.
He did not identify the regulator, but Canadian newspapers reported on Saturday that the British Columbia Securities Commission was looking into the matter.
Lakshman said Hirsch was not available for interviews and he was unsure of her whereabouts.
The controversy is over Hirsch's investments in a Vancouver-based exploration firm, Oliver Gold Corp., earlier this year while she was a high-profile fund manager with AGF Management Ltd. in Toronto.
Hirsch, a flamboyant stock picker compared to her sedate peers in Canada's mutual fund industry, was hired by Fidelity with much fanfare in August after only 10 months at AGF.
Fidelity is conducting its own review of Hirsch's actions before she joined the company.
During her brief stint at AGF, Hirsch bought 65,000 special warrants of Oliver Gold for herself through a private placement in April, according to statements filed with the British Columbia Securities Commission and reported by Vancouver-based Canada Stockwatch, a newsletter which tracks Canadian stocks.
Hirsch paid C$1.53 ($1.14) per warrant.
A short time later, the AGF Growth &amp; Income Fund managed by Hirsch bought 295,000 special warrants, according to the filings with the B.C. commission.
The AGF fund paid over double the price, C$3.60 ($2.69) per warrant, paid by Hirsch.
Another related issue is whether Hirsch used a false address in British Columbia to buy the Oliver Gold shares. Canadian newspapers have reported that the home address of a Vancouver stock analyst and institutional salesman was used.
Hirsch is a resident of Ontario and the Oliver Gold stock was only available to British Columbia residents.
AGF chief executive officer Warren Goldring has said Hirsch broke company rules by failing to report her personal investment in Oliver Gold. He added Hirsch could have been fired if AGF had known about the trades.
The controversy swirling around Hirsch has dominated the business pages of Canadian newspapers, but Lakshman said the publicity has not hurt Fidelity's efforts to build a higher profile in Canadian equities management.
""We have had a lot of great responses to the (True North) fund. It has been well-received and has grown to more than C$150 million ($112 million),"" Lakshman said.

1801,"Shares in Canadian waste and transportation firm Laidlaw Inc soared on Tuesday as investors and analysts applauded major moves in ambulance services and waste management worth over $2 billion.
While Laidlaw's stock hit new heights on the Toronto Stock Exchange, chief executive officer James Bullock said the company is poised for strong growth with two huge deals announced after the market closed on Monday.
In a bid to become North America's top ambulance operator, Laidlaw plans to acquire Colorado-based American Medical Response Inc in a $1.12 billion cash deal and merge it with its California-based MedTrans ambulance services unit.
In the other transaction, Laidlaw has signed a letter of intent to sell its South Carolina-based Environmental Services unit for $1 billion in cash, shares and debt to Rollins Environmental Services Inc of Delaware.
Laidlaw will own 66-percent of a new combined company, Laidlaw Environmental Services Inc., which will be the dominant player in North American hazardous waste management.
The moves came a few weeks after Burlington, Ontario-based Laidlaw completed the $1.65 billion sale of its solid waste management business to Allied Waste Industries Inc of Arizona.
Laidlaw's class B stock closed up C$1.80 ($1.33) at a 52-week high of C$18 ($13) in heavy turnover of 9.3 million shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Laidlaw's class A stock improved C$1.45 ($1.06) to a new high of C$17.95 ($13.23).
""We've got a (share price) target level of around C$19 ($14) and C$20 ($15) for the year and it will probably go higher when the dust settles,"" said Ira Katzin, an investment advisor with RBC Dominion Securities.
AMR jumped 6-3/8 to close at 39-3/8 on the New York exchange, while Rollins Environmental added 1/2 at 2-1/2.
Analysts said the Rollins deal will further consolidate a fragmented industry and may improve hazardous waste prices which have been depressed in the past four to five years.
The AMR acquisition will also boost Laidlaw's presence in the fast-growing healthcare transportation area.
""Strategically it is quite wise,"" Bunting Warburg Inc. analyst Ted Larkin said in a telephone interview.
""The highest growth potential is with their transportation companies. They are also able to partially spinoff the hazardous waste operations and also allow that company to regain a profile by listing on the New York Stock Exchange,"" Larkin said.
In a note to clients, Lehman Brothers analyst Jeff Kessler said the $40 a share offer for AMR is fair and he recommended investors tender their shares.
With combined annual revenues of about $1.3 billion, the new AMR will hold a 14 percent share of the $10 billion ambulance industry. It also gives Laidlaw access to related medical transport services which are a $30 billion market.
Bullock said AMR will immediately boost Laidlaw's earnings, but he declined to give a specific forecast.
Larkin bumped his profit forecast for Laidlaw in the 1997 fiscal year ended August to $0.71 a share from $0.70 per share. He also revised his 1998 forecast up to $0.88 per share from the low eighties.
Some analysts raised concerns that anti-trust issues may hamper the AMR deal, but Bullock said he does not foresee any problems with regulators.
The transaction with Rollins Environmental will be neutral to Laidlaw's earnings in the near term while operations are consolidated.
Bullock said staff levels may be reduced by between 15-20 percent and 20 facilities may be closed, leaving about 100 facilities in the merged firm. The integration will yield more efficient operations and savings of US$75 million annually.

1809,"Canada's major banks, still smarting from last year's bank-bashing budget, are hoping for no major surprises and perhaps some tax relief from Finance Minister Paul Martin next week.
Last year, Martin stunned the banks when he rejected their bid for expanded powers in insurance. He also extended a controversial capital tax on the banks for another year.
In the run up to next Tuesday's 1997/98 budget, bankers have lobbied for a lighter tax burden which, they argue, is among the heaviest in corporate Canada.
""We feel the banks are paying more than their fair share of taxes. Particularly our concern is capital taxes,"" said Mark Weseluck, vice-president of banking operations for the Canadian Bankers Association.
The Big Six banks -- Royal Bank of Canada, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Bank of Montreal, Bank of Nova Scotia, Toronto-Dominion Bank and National Bank of Canada -- have rung up record profits in the past three years.
The group earned a combined C$6.26 billion in 1996, up 21 percent from the previous year. The banks are expected to report strong first-quarter results later this month.
At their annual meetings this year, bankers stressed they paid record taxes of more than C$5.5 billion in 1996.
But social activists argue the banks should pay more tax on what they call ""excessive"" profits.
In its ""alternative"" budget released this week, the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives urged Martin to impose an ""excess profits"" tax on the banks and other financial institutions totaling C$496 million in 1997/98.
Other groups want Martin to use the existing 12 percent capital tax to encourage small business lending -- an area in which the banks have been criticized for not doing enough.
In Ontario -- where five of the six major banks are based -- the Conservative government hit the banks with a 10 percent capital tax surcharge in last spring's budget.
The banks can eliminate some or all of the tax if they invest more in small business between now and the end of 1999. Ontario Finance officials said it was too early to measure the program's performance, but several major banks unveiled small business loan programs in recent months.
Weseluck said the Ontario tax had little to do with those announcements. ""The problem when you do this is that taxation gets less efficient the more they are used to boost investment in a certain part of the market which the banks are doing extensively anyway,"" he said.
Analysts doubted Martin would do any major tinkering on bank taxes next week.
""I don't expect any new additional taxes and I doubt if there is any tax relief. The only possible source of tax relief is that the government would not extend this capital tax,"" said Nesbitt Burns analyst Hugh Brown.
With bank bashing a popular sport among Canadian voters, Martin may be loathe to give the banks a tax break in what is shaping up to be an election year, analysts said.
Adding to this year's budget boredom is the absence of last year's noisy battle between the banks and insurers.
Martin shocked the banks when he slammed the door on their bid for broader insurance powers and pre-empted a government white paper on financial reforms, which was several months away from being released.
Martin has set up a task force to study those and other competition issues, including whether major banks should be allowed to merge. But reforms recommended by the task force are not expected to take effect until 2000.

1810,"Far from the hoopla of the U.S. presidential race, Jack Kemp's youngest son, Jimmy, has been tossing footballs on Canada's windswept prairie and relishing his relative anonymity.
To football fans in this small western Canada city, Kemp is better known as the quarterback of their beloved Saskatchewan Roughriders than the son of the American Republican vice-presidential candidate.
""It's nice to have your own identity. Up here I'm a Roughriders quarterback and not Jack Kemp's son. I'm proud of my dad, but it's great to be in Canada,"" Kemp, 25, told Reuters during a recent interview at a local sports pub.
The well-mannered, cherub-faced Kemp is finishing his third year in the Canadian Football League. He was traded to the Regina team last August after stints with the Montreal Alouettes and the now-defunct San Antonio Texans and Sacramento Gold Miners.
As the Nov. 5 election nears, Kemp said he does not get too bothered about his high-profile father. The local press has pretty much left that part of his life private.
""Kemp Just a Normal Guy,"" the Regina Leader-Post newspaper said in a story about the young quarterback when he arrived in town.
Before going to Saskatchewan, Kemp joined his family at the Republican convention in San Diego and pondered quitting football to work on his dad's campaign. But the elder Kemp, a former American Football League quarterback who tried out for the CFL's Calgary Stampeders in 1958, urged his son to continue playing.
""We prayed and talked about it and my dad wanted me to take this opportunity that has been given to me,"" said Kemp, who has since enjoyed some success with Saskatchewan.
A back-up when he arrived in Regina, Kemp was forced into the spotlight after the club's other quarterbacks fell to injuries.
Kemp had the best game of his career this month, passing for three touchdowns in a come-from-behind win against Hamilton. But the team struggled this year and failed to make the playoffs.
""I think I'm good enough to start in this league. I don't think I'm a great quarterback right now, but I need to play more and go through a training camp,"" he said.
Jack Kemp has kept a close eye on his son's football career. He flew to Canada three times this season when Jimmy played for Montreal and they talk frequently about football over the telephone.
""He's incredibly encouraging. Even to the point that it gets on my nerves sometimes because he is a very proud father and he thinks anything that I do is great,"" the younger Kemp said.
Despite living on the Canadian prairies, Kemp keeps tabs on his father's campaign. He watched the vice presdential debate on CNN and catches the programme ""This Week With David Brinkley"" before a Sunday game.
He said he did not have much faith in opinion polls that show the Bob Dole/Jack Kemp ticket lagging far behind the Democratic team of President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore.
""I think people can change their minds easily and I think the support for Clinton is soft. I guess it doesn't look good, but I think they've got a chance,"" Kemp said.
Kemp does not plan to follow his father into politics, but he does not rule out getting involved at the local level.
""I'm not sure my dad was interested in politics when he was 25. My brother (Jeff) is probably more of a politican than I am, but I do care about the issues,"" he said.

1812,"Ontario Hydro, North America's biggest power utility, said Tuesday that it would take a huge C$2.5 billion ($1.8 billion) charge in 1996 to strengthen its financial structure.
The debt-laden, Ontario government-owned utility said its board of directors also approved a C$600 million ($440 million) charge against 1997 earnings.
The charges, related to accounting and operational changes, come as the ruling Conservative government of Canada's most-populous province ponders the privatisation of the massive utility.
The heavy writedowns add up to an estimated 1996 net loss of C$1.9 billion ($1.4 billion), Ontario Hydro said in a statement. The utility previously forecast net income of between C$600 million ($440 million) and C$625 million ($460 million).
""These decisions are driven by our determination to improve nuclear performance and to make capital and policy decisions that enable us to succeed in the business environment we face,"" said Ontario Hydro Chief Executive Officer Allan Kupcis.
He said the move will not affect Hydro's ability to pay down its debt, estimated at more than C$30 billion ($22 billion) due to overexpansion.
Ontario Hydro is the continent's largest electricity producer based on installed generating capacity and one of the world's biggest non-sovereign borrowers.
It operates 96 hydro-electric stations, five nuclear plants and six fossil-fuel stations.
But competitive pressures from within and outside Ontario have forced changes on Hydro in recent years.
Last June, a government commission recommended that Ontario Hydro lose its 90-year power monopoly and face competition from private Canadian power suppliers and U.S.-based competitors.
Among the operating decisions made Tuesday, the utility said it will scale back or cancel some projects. The biggest single charge was a C$1.2 billion ($882 million) writedown reflecting the costs of surplus heavy water at its nuclear operations.
The decisions will not affect employee staffing levels at the utility.

1816,"Canada's Big Six banks are poised for a third straight year of record profits when they begin reporting year-end earnings on Tuesday, but analysts expect earnings growth to slow in 1997.
The group's combined profit is expected to top C$6 billion ($4.5 billion) for the year ended Oct. 31, eclipsing a record C$5.2 billion ($3.8 billion) in 1995, analysts said.
Most of the increase was due to higher investment banking and fee revenues and lower loan losses.
""It's going to be a very good quarter again, but we may be getting toward the end of very strong quarter-over-quarter growth,"" said Roy Palmer, an analyst with TD Securities Inc.
High-flying bank stocks may get a further boost if the group beats analysts' estimates for fourth-quarter profit gains of between 15 percent and 17 percent.
""If we get good news and they come in at or higher than analysts' estimates, I think you will see some significant strength,"" said Fred Ketchen, director of equity trading for ScotiaMcLeod Inc.

CIBC Wood Gundy analyst Mark Maxwell said the group's valuation multiples were averaging 1.7 times book value -- narrowing the gap between Canadian bank shares and their U.S. counterparts.
Maxwell said in a report that bank officials warned analysts that their estimates for average earnings growth of 14 percent in 1997 were too optimistic and that 8 percent was The earnings parade will kick off with Bank of Montreal on Tuesday and wrap up with National Bank of Canada on Dec. 5.

Bank of Nova Scotia's earnings on Wednesday are seen climbing to C$1.01 (75 cents) a share from 88 cents Canadian (65 cents) a share.

1817,"Shivering icewine enthusiasts, battered by icy winds, headed into a snow-covered vineyard on a recent night to harvest one of the world's rarest wines.
Although Germany discovered the luscious dessert wine in the late 18th century, Canada is the world's largest producer of icewine -- capturing many international awards and helping shed an industry reputation for screw-top plonk that neither amuses nor has any pretentions.
If you can find it, this ""liquid gold"" can cost up to C$200 ($150) a bottle in icewine-crazy Japan -- four times the price in Canada. Japan is by far the biggest export market, but China and South Korea are also developing a taste for it.
But on this cold winter night a cup of piping hot coffee could fetch a better price than any chilled wine. ""It's cold, hard work. You're outside in the dark picking frozen grapes and wondering why you're not asleep like normal people,"" Greg Berti, general manager of Hillebrand Estates Winery, said on a recent midnight tour of Hillebrand's icewine fields.
Most of the Canadian vintage comes from the Niagara wine region where 24 wineries produced 29,700 gallons (112,500 liters) in 1995. That is up 57 percent from 1994 but paltry compared to the eight million gallons (30 million liters) of regular wine produced yearly in Ontario, Canada's most populous province.
Some California wineries produce sweet wines but they are shunned by icewine purists because the grapes are artificially frozen. ""Their wine is interesting, but it's not in the same league as icewine,"" Berti said.
IT MAY BE RARE BUT IT TASTES LIKE PEACHES
Although Niagara wineries say their products are unique in taste, icewine is generally amber or golden in colour with a full-flavored taste similar to honey, apricots or peaches. It is thicker than regular wine, with an alcohol content of about 10 percent, compared to 40 percent for a cognac or brandy.
Canada exports icewine to Germany, Denmark, Hong Kong, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the United States. China and Korea are also emerging markets. But the biggest buyers are Japanese tourists who flock to the Niagara region by the busload -- snapping up several bottles of icewine after a visit to nearby Niagara Falls.
Hillebrand sells about 75 percent of its icewine to Japanese who tour its winery. ""Their image of Canada is Banff, Anne of Green Gables and Niagara Falls, and icewine fits in with that image,"" Berti said.
Last summer, a group of 74 Japanese race horse owners descended on another Niagara winery and drove off with more than $10,000 worth of icewine. ""They came into the winery, sampled, bought and were back in their bus in 45 minutes,"" recalled Debi Pratt, director of public relations for Inniskillin Wines Inc.
ALMOST AS HARD TO PRODUCE AS GOLD
It takes every grape from an entire vine to yield enough juice to make one bottle of icewine -- 10 times the amount used to make regular wines. Many grapes are lost to hungry birds, hail or harsh winter winds before they are picked.
But Canada has plenty of what is needed most to make icewine -- consistently cold weather.
The grapes -- hardy Vidal or Riesling varieties -- must be picked off the vine when temperatures are well below freezing.
Most wineries set aside part of their vineyards in October when the regular wine harvest ends. By mid-December or early January the shriveled grapes have turned a brownish hue and pickers are on call, waiting for the right weather.
Berti said Mother Nature has sometimes forced crews to pick on Christmas Eve or New Year's Eve -- although that did not happen this year.
""The wind is the biggest problem. Every hour or half hour we take a break for hot coffee and donuts,"" Gregory Synos, a six-year veteran of the icewine harvest, said.
The grapes are sorted and rushed to the winery where presses work into the night. The juice then goes through several weeks of fermentation, followed by a few months of ageing in oak barrels to smooth out the acidity and tanins in immature icewine.
Although Hillebrand has tried to modernise the process by using special presses and protective netting for the grapes, Berti conceded: ""There is nothing efficent about it. You have to get into the fields when the getting is good.""

1818,"Toronto stocks soared to new highs on Wednesday as foreign investors jumped into Canada's financial markets, lured by falling interest rates and the recovering economy.
Shares in Canada's big six banks hit 52-week highs on the Toronto Stock Exchange, propelling the country's biggest stock market to its 53rd record close of 1996.
The Canadian dollar has also surged this week, hitting its strongest level in a year.
Declining interest rates, low inflation and falling budget deficits have combined to make Canada the flavor of the month, economists said.
""Overall, foreign investors have just become enamoured with Canada as a place for investment,"" Michael Gregory, an economist with Lehman Brothers, said in a telephone interview.
The Toronto Stock Exchange index of 300 stocks jumped 85.45 points to close at 5,749.92, fuelled by brisk action in interest-rate sensitive issues such as banks and utilities.
The index has gained more than 20 percent this year, compared to 20.7 percent for the Dow Jones industrial average and 17.6 percent for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index.
The Bank of Canada is expected to cut interest rates again as early as this week. The central bank has cut rates 19 times since May 1995 in a bid to revive a sluggish economy.
Bank of Canada Governor Gordon Thiessen said on Wednesday that Canada's improving economy gives the central bank more latitude to set Canadian rates independent of U.S. rates.
He added Canada is now in a better position to withstand a hike in U.S. rates than it has been in recent years.
""The economic outlook is favourable. We will soon see signs of the payoff for the difficult restructuring decisions taken in both the private and public sectors,"" Thiessen said.
After several years of belt tightening, Canadian governments have either balanced their budgets or are on track to wipe out huge deficits.
Canada's 1.2 percent inflation rate is one of the lowest in the world and less than half the U.S. rate.
Several Canadian banks cut residential mortgage rates on Wednesday to levels not seen in about three decades.
Gregory said he expected Canada to continue to outperform the United States on the rate front and that offshore investors recognised that.
""I think investors are coming to terms with the fact that Canadian interest rates -- because of low inflation and improving currency prospects -- should be below U.S. rates,"" he said. ""Many investors are jumping on that and the Canadian dollar is undervalued. It's cheap.""
The Canadian currency closed around C$1.3312 (75 cents) Wednesday after trading around C$1.3300 earlier in the session.
In stock trading, TSE's financial services group jumped 2.5 percent after soaring 3 percent Tuesday. Declining interest rates make bank lending more profitable and bank dividends more attractive for investors.
Soaring bank profits have also lured investors. The major banks report their year-end results in a few weeks and are on track for a third straight year of record profits.
Recent listings on the New York Stock Exchange have given Canadian banks a higher profile in the United States where they are considered cheap compared with U.S. bank stocks.
New York-based Morgan Stanley issued a recommendation on two Canadian banks on Tuesday and predicted a strong fourth quarter for the entire group.

1828,"Ontario Finance Minister Ernie Eves, buoyed by a stronger economy and an improving deficit outlook, said on Thursday his budget-paring knife would not cut as deep this year.
""I would say that the majority of the cost-cutting exercise this government has to do is behind us,"" Eves told reporters after delivering a fiscal update for the third quarter ended December 31.
Ontario's 1996/97 deficit is now pegged at C$7.67 billion for the year ending March 31, down C$508 million from Eves' original budget forecast. Ontario is Canada's most populous province and industrial powerhouse.
Barely four months ago, Ontario's ruling Conservatives said a further C$3 billion in spending cuts would be needed to balance the budget by the turn of the century.
Since sweeping to power in 1995 promising a ""Common Sense Revolution"", the Conservatives have identified about C$8 billion in cuts through the end of the decade.
With the economy now improving, Eves said: ""I don't feel that I am now driven to find C$3 billion in more savings.""
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce has predicted Ontario's economy would pick up steam this year despite government cutbacks. The economy was forecast to grow 3.1 percent this year and 2.3 percent in 1998, compared to 1.7 percent in 1996.
But Eves said the province's deficit fight was far from over and he was still seeking ""cost efficiencies"" for the upcoming 1997/98 budget this spring.
""I don't want anybody to think we don't have a problem. We still have a C$7.7 billion problem on annualized basis in the province of Ontario,"" he said.
Government revenues grew faster than projected in the third quarter, up almost C$1.2 billion to C$47.8 billion for the year. Most of the increase was due to higher than expected personal, corporate and retail sales tax revenues resulting from a stronger economy, Eves said.
He said the government's controversial 30 percent tax cut had helped boost consumer confidence in Ontario. About half of the tax reduction has been implemented, with the remaining 15 percent due by 1999.
Eves said he had not ruled out speeding up that timetable, but that the government had a lot on its plate.
Last month, the Conservatives unveiled sweeping reforms that would fundamentally alter the roles of provincial and local governments in everything from health care and social spending to road maintenance and sewage.
The most controversial move is a proposed merger of Toronto, Canada's biggest city, and five surrounding municipalities, which has drawn fierce opposition from some local politicians and businesses.
CIBC said the provincial government would better its fiscal targets after downloading services such as welfare and transit to municipalities. Toronto is a potential loser under the plan because it has a large share of the province's welfare cases.
Eves said the government would push forward with its plans and on Thursday he doubled the government's restructuring fund to C$1.8 billion.
""I think people realize we can't operate in 1997 the way we operated in 1957 in the province of Ontario. There is a transition and that transition costs money,"" he said.

1833,"Canada's financial markets gave an approving nod to Finance Minister Paul Martin's stay-the-course 1997/98 budget on Tuesday, with some analysts expecting a modest rally on Wednesday.
In what is expected to be an election year, the Liberal government said it will maintain pressure on the deficit while offering minor tax cuts and new spending.
Economists said Martin's assumptions on interest rates and economic growth were prudent and should enable the government to beat its fiscal targets.
""What you're going to see tomorrow? A flow of funds into the Canadian dollar briefly, quite possibly the bond market, quite possibly the stock market,"" said Bob Boaz, director of research for HSBC James Capel Canada Inc.
But analysts predicted the markets would settle down quickly as most of the budget details were widely expected.
""There was no big news in this budget. But he (Martin) didn't relax his fiscal resolve and that will be well received by the markets,"" said John Anania, an economist at Royal Bank of Canada, the country's biggest bank.
The budget had little immediate impact on the Canadian dollar, but currency traders said they expect the unit to strengthen overnight on Martin's favorable deficit targets.
Martin predicted the deficit for 1996/97 would be no more that C$19 billion, compared to a projected C$24.3 billion. The deficit is seen falling to C$17 billion in 1997/98.
In early evening trading, the Canadian dollar firmed slightly to C$1.3534 (US$0.7388) from closing levels at C$1.3546 (US$0.7382).
""We expect the Canadian dollar to appreciate overnight as a result of the positive budget,"" said John Nicholson, managing director of Scotia Capital Markets.
Canadian bonds strengthened shortly after the budget's release as the market welcomed news of only modest new spending initatives.
Some bond analysts expressed concern that Martin did not set a target for balancing the country's books, but overall they expected a neutral reaction to the budget on Wednesday.
""He's made some extremely conservative assumptions, we believe, with interest rates and growth that lead us to conclude he will continue to outperform his own targets,"" said Hank Cunningham, director of fixed income with First Marathon Securities.
The budget is expected to be well received on Canada's biggest stock market on Wednesday, after the Toronto Stock Exchange enjoyed record gains on Tuesday, analysts said.
Before the budget's release, the TSE's key 300 index posted its ninth record close of 1997, up 20 points to 6238.22. Trading was heavy with turnover of 138.4 million shares worth C$2.52 billion, the TSE's second highest value ever.

1836,"Canada's cash-strapped public broadcaster, the CBC, cut almost 1,000 jobs on Wednesday in an overhaul that might eventually include on-air fund-raising drives and corporate sponsorships.
The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. -- faced with a C$414 million ($304 million) reduction in government subsidies -- told 996 employees that they would be laid off.
The layoff notices were part of a plan announced in September to scrap 2,400 jobs through layoffs, voluntary departures and the elimination of vacant positions.
The CBC also set a target of 800 job cuts in 1998.
""Without doubt, the next few months will be tough. However, we have some sense that on the financial front the worst may be over,"" Jim Byrd, vice-president of CBC English television, said in a letter to employees.
The CBC, which provides television and radio services in English and French, previously announced other measures to pare more than a third from its C$1.4 billion ($1.02 billion) budget by 1998.
The Canadian government contributed almost two-thirds of the CBC budget in the past, but the government's huge budget deficit forced deep cuts in funding for the CBC.
CBC unions said the job cuts would result in an inferior product for Canadian taxpayers.
""There's shock. There's anger. These are people with hundreds of years of experience who will walk out the door and never come back again,"" said Dan Oldfield, a spokesman for the Canadian Media Guild, which represents 3,000 CBC workers.
On Monday, the CBC said Radio Canada International -- Canada's voice to the world -- would close next March due to a lack of government funding.
To offset shrinking federal subsidies, CBC President Perrin Beatty said earlier this week that the broadcaster may use on-air fund-raising drives and corporate sponsorships.
Beatty recently visited the New York-based U.S. public television network PBS, which holds fund-raising campaigns and receives millions of dollars from Canadian viewers.
""It's something that is under discussion as we speak,"" said CBC spoksman Tom Curzon, adding that the CBC board had not made a final decision.
To boost revenues and ratings, the CBC relied on popular U.S. television shows and major sporting events in recent years. But some CBC purists complained that the broadcaster had forsaken its mandate to promote and protect Canada's identity from the U.S. cultural behemoth.
In September, Beatty said CBC would return to its Canadian roots by eliminating U.S. shows from prime time and day-time schedules by 1998.
Canadians will also see more advertisements on the CBC, including commercials for the first time on its flagship evening news show, the National.

1852,"Deere &amp; Co. Tuesday reported record fourth-quarter and annual earnings as demand grew for its agricultural, industrial, commercial and consumer equipment worldwide.
Net income jumped 15 percent to $173.9 million, or 68 cents a share, for the quarter ended Oct. 31, from $150.6 million, or 57 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Revenues rose 7 percent to $2.9 billion from $2.7 billion.
""The company's operating margins remain strong as our focus on continuous improvement and growth is having a positive impact throughout our businesses,"" Deere Chairman Hans Becherer said in a statement.
But fourth quarter profits were less than some analysts had expected, although results did include a $15 million after-tax write-off to integrate and consolidate various Mexican operations.
Deere's stock dropped $2.625 to $44 on the New York Stock Exchange.
""Deere came in a little light on a reported basis,"" NatWest Markets analyst Thomas Burns said.
Profits for the fiscal year rose 16 percent to $817.3 million, or $3.14 a share, from $706.1 million, or $2.71 a share, last year. Revenues climbed 9 percent to $11.2 billion from $10.3 billion.
One area of weakness was Deere's commercial and consumer equipment business, such as lawn and landscaping products.
Worldwide commercial and consumer equipment operating profits fell to $1 million for the fourth quarter from $35 million last year, and to $118 million for the full fiscal year from $165 million a year ago. Deere blamed the drop on lower sales volume and increased promotional and growth expenditures.
""The one big operational shortfall that was very, very disappointing and was a surprise to us was the commercial and consumer business,"" Dain Bosworth analyst J. Blair Brumley said.
Moline, Ill.-based Deere said export sales from the United States continued to grow, by 20 percent to $1.58 billion for 1996 from $1.31 billion last year.
Overseas sales for the year remained very strong, rising by 26 percent to $2.75 billion, topping $2.5 billion for the first time in the company's history, Deere said.
Worldwide agricultural equipment operating profits jumped to $202 million for the fourth quarter from $135 million in the year-ago period.
Worldwide demand for John Deere agricultural equipment remains very strong, Becherer said.
Overseas agricultural equipment sales, which were strong during 1996, are expected to continue to increase in 1997 due to sales in Ukraine and Kazakhstan.
Industrial equipment operating profit fell to $34 million for the fourth quarter from $36 million last year. Deere cited increased development expenses associated with improving the fuel efficiency and emissions performance of new engines.
Net income of Deere's financial services subsidiaries was $47.6 million for the quarter vs. $41 million a year ago.
Looking ahead, Deere said it expected worldwide physical volume of sales to dealers on a comparable basis to increase by about 5 percent in 1997 compared with 1996.

1858,"Former Archer Daniels Midland Co. executive Mark Whitacre said Tuesday he was no longer cooperating with the U.S. government in its price-fixing probe, adding yet another wrinkle to the complex antitrust case.
Whitacre, a government informant for about three years in the federal investigation of his former employer, was indicted Tuesday along with two other ex-ADM executives for conspiring to fix prices of the feed additive lysine.
Also indicted were Michael Andreas, former executive vice president and vice chairman of ADM, and Terrance Wilson, a former group vice president. Michael Andreas is also the son of ADM Chairman Dwayne Andreas.
""I have decided not to participate in the government's coverup any longer,"" Whitacre told Reuters.
Asked to comment on the indictment against him, Whitacre said, ""I have no comment other than when all the evidence comes out in this case, the only people that will have questions yet to answer will be the Justice Department and the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) itself.""
The Justice Department did not respond to Whitacre's statement.
Legal experts said it was common for federal informants and cooperative witnesses to be indicted, though they often receive lenient treatment and light sentences in return for their cooperation.
""If the informant got too good a deal, it would diminish his credibility,"" said James Shapiro, a former assistant U.S. Attorney in Chicago who has no direct knowledge of the case involving ADM and Whitacre.
Whitacre's decision to stop cooperating with the government could jeopardise his treatment by the Justice Department. But antitrust attorney Champ Davis of the Chicago firm Davis, Mannix and McGrath, said Whitacre's previous cooperation could still be taken into consideration.
""He can argue, I think, that he was cooperative up to a point,"" said Davis, who is not involved in the ADM case. ""(That) is a factor that ought to be taken into account.""
By no longer cooperating -- and presumably not agreeing to testify on behalf of the government in upcoming trials against the defendants -- Whitacre could weaken the government's case somewhat, legal experts said.
""It would weaken the government's case (against Michael Andreas and Wilson) to some extent, not to have the guy who made the tapes to interpret them,"" Shapiro said.
While he was cooperating with federal investigators, Whitacre had said that he made hundreds of tape recordings of ADM executives allegedly in price-fixing discussions.
But the government's case was unlikely to be derailed since the tapes still could be used, Shapiro said.
In October, ADM pleaded guilty to two counts of fixing prices of lysine, a feed additive, and citric acid, which is used in food, beverages and other products. ADM also agreed to pay a $100 million fine.
A lawsuit Whitacre filed against his former employer in November stated that the government's case against ADM was based ""in large part upon the information obtained from Whitacre.""
Whitacre gave no further reasons for his decision to stop cooperating with the government. But he has been involved in several legal tangles since the ADM price-fixing probe first came to light in June 1995.
In August 1995, ADM fired Whitacre, who had been head of its BioProducts division, for allegedly stealing $9 million from the company. Whitacre has denied those charges, saying the money allegedly involved off-the-books bonuses that he received that were approved by company management.
ADM has sued Whitacre over the $9 million. Whitacre filed a wrongful dismissal suit last month against ADM.
The Justice Department has been conducting a separate investigation into the money that Whitacre received and allegations of off-the-books payments by ADM.

1861,"Conseco Inc's $477 million planned purchase of Pioneer Financial Services Inc, its seventh acquisition announced this year, is aimed at building the company's product offerings for senior citizens.
Conseco is already among the leading providers of supplemental health insurance, retirement annuities and life insurance for consumers aged 40 and older, analysts said.
""The (aged) 65-plus consumer is a key part of the current marketplace and also a rapidly growing piece of that 40-plus marketplace,"" added James Rosensteele, Conseco spokesman.  
For Pioneer, a health and life insurance company based in Schaumburg, Ill., its agreement to join forces with Conseco reflects continued consolidation in the industry.
""With the consolidation that's going on in the industry, you're going to have to be a mega-company to have the greatest efficiency and the greatest value to the customer,"" EVEREN analyst Frederick Sandburg said.
That consolidation is apparent in Conseco's track record of completing 16 acquisitions involving a total of 29 insurance companies since 1982.  
In the latest deal, Pioneer shareholders will receive a fraction of a Conseco share worth $25 to $28 for each Pioneer share held.
Rosensteele said earnings from Pioneer operations will more than offset the dilutive effect of the Conseco shares to be issued in the deal. Conseco said previously it expects Pioneer to add about $0.15 per fully diluted share to its operating earnings in the first year.
Pioneer shares were up 5-7/8 at 24-7/8 at mid-day on Monday, and Conseco shares were up 2-1/8 at 61-5/8.  
Rosensteele said that while acquisitions continue to be a part of Conseco's strategy, roughly half of the growth of its assets has been from new business generated by companies after they have been purchased.
Conseco said it would have $29 billion of assets and $32 billion of investments under management after completion of the Pioneer acquisition and other deals.
Beyond the portfolio of policies, the Pioneer acquisition also will add to Conseco's marketing efforts, particularly to senior citizens, analysts said.  Pioneer has 90,000 agents, in addition to Conseco's 90,000 independent and career agents.  
""It really helps them (Conseco) in distribution capability,"" Dean Witter analyst Michael Lewis said.
Through its Bankers Life and Casualty unit, Conseco sells to senior citizens through career insurance agents.

1863,"The green fields of agricultural biotechnology are turning into a legal battle ground as companies file suits and countersuits against each other to protect their stakes in the budding business.
Biotech players are ""suing each other over control of the technology,"" said Ray Goldberg, professor of Agriculture and Business at the Harvard Graduate School of Business. ""They are going to redefine how they work together.""
At stake are rights to produce and sell genetically enhanced crops. After more than a decade of research, biotech crops are beginning to be commercialized. They include corn and cotton that produce their own pesticides and soybeans that can withstand the use of certain herbicides.
In the end, analysts and company executives say, many of the lawsuits are expected to be settled out of court, resulting in agreements to license and swap technology.
""It is very unlikely, because stakes are very high, that the seed companies will really let this work its way entirely through the court system,"" said Dain Bosworth analyst Bonnie Wittenburg.
""Ultimately (companies) will cross-license, trade rights and use these pieces of protected technology as assets and trade them back and forth,"" added Timothy Martin, a spokesman for Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc.
Pioneer, which provides the leading share of seed for corn, the biggest U.S. crop, has been sued for alleged patent infringement by DeKalb Genetics Corp.
Pioneer's defence is that it has a U.S. patent pending, which if approved could supersede DeKalb's claims. Pioneer said the application for that patent was filed before DeKalb's.
The case illustrates how new and pending patents complicate the legal landscape for agricultural biotechnology as seed and biotech development companies seek protection for their gene portfolios, production methods and the biotech crops themselves.
""The patent positions are not yet clear. The patents that have been issued leave some room for different interpretations,"" said Michael Sund, vice president of communications and investor relations for Mycogen Corp.
Mycogen and Monsanto Co. have sued each other for alleged patent infringement, and Mycogen is considering appealing some recent rulings in Monsanto's favour, Sund said.
Despite the legal complications, companies are expected to continue full-steam to commercialize biotech crops.
""They've made the decision to go ahead,"" said Piper Jaffray analyst George Dahlman.
Mycogen, for example, this year commercialized in limited quantities three corn hybrids that contain the Bt gene, which enables the plant to produce a substance that is toxic to the European core borer, a major pest.
Sund said the hybrids have performed well, as expected, in fighting off the corn borer. ""Performance has been everything we hoped for,"" he added.
A genetically enhanced cotton that contains the Bt gene to fight bollworm has come under some tough scrutiny this year after a heavy infestation of the pest in some areas of Texas prompted farmers to use chemical sprays on the crop.
Monsanto, which collaborated with Delta and Pine Land Co. to produce Bollgard cotton, maintained that the biotech crop still performed well. Monsanto said Bollgard cotton had to be sprayed less than traditional cotton.
The collaboration between Monsanto and Delta and Pine Land is but one example of the partnerships that are being forged in agricultural biotechnology.
Monsanto has an ownership stake in DeKalb and Pioneer has a research collaboration with Mycogen.
These partnerships -- like the lawsuits -- underscore one key aspect of the biotechnology business: no one party has all the key pieces to the puzzle.
""No one single firm has the monopoly on the germ plasm,"" Goldberg said. ""No one single firm has the monopoly on the science.""

1867,"Monsanto Co, which produces genetically altered soybeans, on Wednesday defended the scientific tests that back its safety claims for the crop.
""We did something like 1,800 tests to evaluate those soybeans,"" said Karen Marshall, manager of public affairs for Monsanto. ""These soybeans are absolutely safe.""
The environmental group Greenpeace has continued to protest the genetically altered soybeans and has criticized  Monsanto for allegedly not testing the biotech crop for exposure to the herbicide Roundup.  
Monsanto's genetically altered Roundup Ready soybeans are resistant to the Roundup herbicide, allowing farmers to spray Roundup on the fields to kill weeds without harming the crop.
But use of Roundup to kill weeds could result in residue on the harvested soybeans.
Marshall of Monsanto, however, said Roundup residue is not an issue since tolerance levels for the herbicide had been previously established and did not need to be established by testing.
Therefore, Monsanto's testing of biotech crop focused on genetic alteration.  
""What we figured would be the new piece of information was the one protein that we added to the plant, itself,"" she said.
Marshall said Roundup Ready soybeans have been reviewed and approved by regulatory bodies in Argentina, Mexico, Canada, Japan, the European Union and United States.
She added that Roundup Ready soybeans have also received food safety approvals in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and most recently Denmark, and are under consideration in Switzerland.
Merrill Lynch analyst Douglas Groh said that while concerns about the Roundup Ready soybeans must be addressed, he does not expect any impediments to market the crops.
""In some form or fashion, Monsanto will be able to commercialize the work that they've done,"" said Groh, who focuses on agribusiness and biotech companies.
He added that residue on the soybean crop should not be an issue since Roundup breaks down over time to ""environmentally benign"" substances that do not pose a threat.

1868,"The higher minimum wage signed into law Tuesday will be welcome relief for millions of workers, but it may also translate into higher prices for hamburgers, pizzas and other fast-food items, some restaurant chains said.
The 90-cent-an-hour increase will have little short-term impact on many fast-food chains that already pay workers rates above the federally mandated minimum.
But in the long run, industry officials fear that workers already earning above the new minimum wage, which will rise to $5.15 an hour next year, will be looking for more.
""What we're concerned about is the ripple effect it brings,"" said Bruce Cotton, chief spokesman for Long John Silver's Restaurants Inc. in Lexington, Ky.
""Our average crew wage is about $5.20 (an hour) so short-term there is not going to be any impact,"" said Denny Lynch, spokesman for Wendy's International Inc., which operates about 4,300 restaurants in the United States.
President Clinton signed into law the first increase in the minimum wage in five years, boosting it by 50 cents to $4.75 on Oct. 1 and 40 cents more to $5.15 on Sept. 1, 1997.
The White House estimates the new law will mean a raise for about 10 million American workers, many of them in restaurants and stores.
Most small businesses had opposed the increase, saying it would prompt them to hire fewer people, particularly young people looking for entry-level jobs.
But some economists argued that the negative effects of an increase in the wage, first imposed by the federal government in 1938 at 25 cents an hour, would be minimal.
To help get the bill through the Republican-controlled Congress, a package of about $22 billion in tax breaks aimed mostly at small businesses was added to the measure.
As a result of the higher minimum wage, American Restaurant Partners L.P., which operates 62 Pizza Hut restaurant franchises, expects its total wage costs will rise $500,000 over the next 12 months.
""If you raise someone who started in the last two months (to the new minimum wage level), you also have to raise everybody else,"" said Terry Freund, chief financial officer of American Restaurant Partners.
To compensate, the Wichita, Kan.-based restaurant operator hopes to raise prices by about 3 percent. The risk, Freund added, is that higher prices will keep some customers away or prompt them to scale back on the pizzas or other items they normally order.
Beyond the minimum wage requirements, competition for workers -- from cooks to delivery drivers to counter staff -- has forced many fast-food chains to pay up to hire good help, particularly in metropolitan markets. That competition is being driven by an increase in restaurant openings, particularly fast-food and casual dining establishments.
""There are neighbourhoods where we have to pay $6.00 an hour to $6.50 or $7.00 to get"" good workers, Wendy's Lynch said. ""The competition is setting the wage.""
Fast-food industry executives said there has been competition for workers since the late 1980s, although the increase in restaurant openings is making the search for employees more intense.
Another problem for fast-food chains is wage competition from other employers. A fast-food worker, for example, may be able to earn $50 or $60 a night in tips at a casual dining establishment, executives said.
""For QSRs (quick service restaurants) ... it's even tougher to keep the kids,"" said Roger Lipton, president of Lipton Financial Services.

1875,"Archer Daniels Midland Co., which earlier this month pleaded guilty to two counts of price fixing, took steps Thursday to ease the reins out of the hands of its 78-year-old chairman, Dwayne Andreas.
ADM, which faced strong criticism from big shareholders at its annual meeting on Oct. 17, said it formed a four-member office of the chief executive, a post that has been held solely by Andreas.
""The fact that they (ADM) listed the ages is signalling something: They're setting this up as part of their succession plan and ... there is more to come,"" Dain Bosworth analyst Bonnie Wittenburg said.
ADM also named replacements for two other executives who left the company earlier this month and remain targets for possible criminal indictments in the federal probe -- Vice Chairman Michael Andreas, the son of Dwayne Andreas, and Terrance Wilson, who had been group vice president in charge of corn refining.
The giant agricultural products company said the newly formed office of the chief executive will consist of Dwayne Andreas, James Randall, president, age 72, Charles Bayless, 61, president of ADM's processing division, and G. Allen Andreas, 53, a nephew of Dwayne Andreas and counsel to the executive committee of the board of directors.
Jon Lukomnik, New York City's deputy controller for pensions, which hold about 3.4 million ADM shares, applauded the executive realignment as a means to address succession. But he said more changes were needed within ADM's top ranks.
""There remains another issue, which is corporate culture,"" said Lukomnik.
New York City pension funds have been among several institutional shareholders pressing for changes in ADM's board and management in the wake of the U.S. antitrust investigation that targeted the company.
A shareholder proposal requiring that the Decatur, Ill.-based company's board be composed of a majority of independent directors was defeated at the annual meeting, but received an usually heavy 42 percent of the votes cast.
On Oct. 14, ADM agreed to pay $100 million in fines and pleaded guilty to fixing prices of lysine, a feed additive, and citric acid, an additive used in foods, beverages and other products.
Among the four-member office of the chief executive, Allen Andreas stands out given his experience building ADM's business in Europe, said Merrill Lynch's Leonard Teitelbaum.
""It goes a long way to putting the events of the last several months behind the company,"" Teitelbaum said of the management changes.
ADM made no mention of the antitrust investigation, which is continuing, although the company has been given immunity from further prospecution in return for its cooperation.
Earlier this month, ADM said Michael Andreas took a temporary leave and Wilson retired for health reasons. In its proxy statement for the annual meeting, ADM said indictments were being considered against the younger Andreas and Wilson.
The new vice chairman is Gaylor Coan, 60, an outside director, who heads Gold Kist Inc., a farmer-owned cooperative in Atlanta, Ga., that is the second-largest poultry processor in the United States and one of the largest shareholders of ADM.
ADM also named Larry Cunningham, 52, as president of ADM's corn processing division and a group vice president, in addition to his dutues as president of ADM's protein specialities.
The company's lysine and citric acid products are both derived from corn.

1877,"Archer Daniels Midland Co, which pleaded guilty to price fixing this week, will face tough criticism at its annual meeting Thursday from shareholders seeking to make ADM's board more independent.
""There needs to be dramatic reform at this company, at...both the board and the management level,"" said Edward Durkin, director of special programs at the United Brotherhood of Carpenters.
The carpenters union is among four institutional shareholders pressing for changes in ADM's board.  
Despite the settlement with the U.S. Justice Department, including the payment of $100 million in fines, corporate governance issues remain at ADM, according to Jon Lukomnik, New York City deputy controller for pensions.
""I think people are looking at this (the Justice settlement) as if it's the last scene in a five-act play. It is not,"" Lukomnik said.
Going forward, Lukomnik said he is looking for ADM to, over time, enact steps to make its board more independent and to set a succession plan for the eventual retirement of Chairman Dwayne Andreas, aged 78.  
The chairman's son, Vice Chairman Michael Andreas, is among two executives still being investigated by the Justice Department as the price-fixing probe continues. Also being investigated is ADM Group Vice President Terrance Wilson.
""Dwayne Andreas is not young. A person they were grooming to be a successor is the target of an investigation,"" Lukomnik said, referring to Michael Andreas, who had been seen in the past as a possible successor to the chairman's post.
A shareholder proposal calling for a more independent board at ADM is garnering a significant number of votes.  
The California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) said earlier a survey of votes cast thus far indicated that 47 percent are in favor of that measure.
CalPERS co-sponsored the proposal with the Florida Retirement System Trust Fund.
""Our primary focus is the proposal,"" Brad Pacheco, a spokesman for CalPERS, said. ""But i think we also need to see some increased oversight (of management by the board).""
Other proposals include a measure by the carpenters to hold directors personally liable for gross negligence. The New York City Fire Department Pension Fund proposed confidential voting for directors when there is no competing proxy.
At last year's annual meeting, Chairman Dwayne Andreas kept a lid on shareholder comments. When Durkin of the carpenters union tried to gain the floor, he was told by the chairman, ""This meeting runs according to my rules.""
Durkin, who will attend this year's annual meeting, said he was hopeful shareholders would be able to voice their concerns this year.
He added the company had sent him a fax outlining the agenda, when issues will be raised and how much time will be allotted for comments. ""There needs to be some basic rights allowed to the (share) owners,"" Durkin said.

1887,"McDonald's Corp. on Friday reported a 10 percent rise in net income, despite a weak U.S. operating environment that was offset by growth overseas.
The fast-food giant, which has nearly 20,000 restaurants worldwide, said net income rose to $440 million from $400 million. Earnings per share gained 11 percent, with fewer shares outstanding, to 62 cents a share from 56 cents.
Earnings for the quarter, however, were about 1 cent below what analysts had expected.
McDonald's, based in Oak Brook, Ill., said operating earnings in the United States fell five percent in the third quarter while company revenues rose only one percent.
""Our U.S. restaurants are operating in a complex, dynamic and difficult marketplace and recent operating performance has fallen short of our goals,"" Chairman Michael Quinlan said in a statement.
McDonald's said U.S. same store sales -- measuring results for units open at least one year -- were negative for both the third quarter and nine-month period.
But U.S. sales may be picking up, said Merrill Lynch analyst Peter Oakes. ""I think (U.S. same store sales) are starting to hit bottom,"" Oakes said. ""Thus far in October, it (seems) like they have picked up and are in the flattish range.""
McDonald's recently reorganized its management to address disappointing results in the United States.
Outside the United States, McDonald's operating earnings grew 11 percent in the quarter as revenue jumped 13 percent.
It said growth in earnings was strongest in Hong Kong, England, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Taiwan. Results in Mexico remained weak due to the sluggish economy, it said.
While McDonald's continues to expand its global reach, the company said its new restaurant openings for 1996 and 1997 likely will be at the low-end of its targeted range of 2,500 to 3,200 units.
""We will hit the low end of our projected range (with) 2,500-plus restaurants (in 1996),"" McDonald's spokesman Chuck Ebeling said. ""We're just doing our planning for next year, but we expect to do 2,500 plus next year.""
This would be the first time in at least three years that McDonald's failed to meet its expansion projections, as it cuts back on limited menu, or satellite, units.
In 1995, McDonald's opened 2,430 units, beating the projection for that year of 2,300. In 1994, it opened 1,800 units, beating the projection of about 1,400 to 1,700.
McDonald's has nearly 20,000 restaurants worldwide.
""We've been ratcheting up the level of development every year since around 1991,"" Ebeling said.
Ebeling said McDonald's this year plans to open about ""600-plus"" satellite units worldwide, down from its original plan of 700 to 1,000 satellites. The biggest decline will be seen in the United States.
""We recognise we need higher volume restaurants to meet the kind of profitability that we'd like for ourselves and our franchisees,"" Ebeling said.
Merrill Lynch analyst Peter Oakes said the profitability of some satellite units, which are often built in non-traditional sites such as shopping malls, has been uncertain. ""In the big picture, the financial performance of satellites appears to be spotty,"" Oakes said.
Ebeling said U.S. satellite units will acount for about one-third of the total for these smaller sites, compared with 60 percent as originally planned.
Overall, Ebeling said about one-third of McDonald's total restaurant openings will still be in the United States.

1894,"At Archer Daniels Midland Co.'s annual meeting last year, Chairman Dwayne Andreas declined to give shareholders the floor, saying, ""This meeting runs according to my rules.""
This year, however, shareholders are pressing for different rules.
Four institutional shareholders will have the floor at Thursday's meeting here to present proposals dealing with corporate governance -- or how the board of directors oversees corporate management at ADM, which on Tuesday pleaded guilty to two counts of price fixing and agreed to pay $100 million in fines, by far the highest penalty ever for violating antitrust laws in the United States.
In its guilty plea, the company admitted it fixed prices for lysine, a feed additive, and citric acid, widely used in foods, beverages and other products.
The shareholder vote at this year's meeting is expected to be close for one proposal that calls for ADM's board to be composed of a majority of independent directors with no personal or business connections with the company.
A survey of early votes showed that about 47 percent were in favour of the measure, the California Public Employees Retirement System (Calpers) said on Wednesday. Calpers, the nation's largest public retirement system, known for its shareholder activism, co-sponsored the proposal with the Florida Retirement System Trust Fund.
""This proposal is prompted by our belief that the employment, business and family relationships of any corporate director has the potential to raise conflicts of interest that may limit the vigilance and diligence of the board,"" the co-sponsors said in a supporting statement contained in ADM's proxy materials for the meeting.
The independence of ADM's board has been an issue since it was disclosed in late June 1995 that the company was the target of a federal price-fixing investigation. Despite the settlement with the Justice Department, some major shareholders continue to voice concern about the board's ability to oversee ADM's management.
Of particular concern to some is that the department continues to investigate two top ADM executives -- Vice Chairman Michael Andreas, the son of Chairman Dwayne Andreas, and Terrance Wilson, group vice president in charge of corn refining. Lysine, citric acid and other ADM products are refined from corn.
""There needs to be dramatic reform at this company, at both the board and the management level,"" said Edward Durkin, director of special programmes at the United Brotherhood of Carpenters union, which is sponsoring a proposal this year to hold directors personally liable in cases of gross negligence.
In addition, the New York City Fire Department Pension Fund has proposed that confidential ballotting be allowed in shareholder votes, except in cases where there is a contested board election.
Since last year's meeting, ADM has agreed to cut its 17-member board down to 12 members. All current company executives have left the board, with the exception of Dwayne Andreas.
Some institutional shareholders have questioned the independence of ADM's nominees as outside directors. One nominee, Mollie Hale Carter, is the daughter of H.D. Hale, a former board member who retired from ADM this year. Other nominees include former Secretary of Agriculture John Block and former Ambassador Richard Burt.
At last year's meeting, which was punctuated with rounds of applause for ADM executives, the board defended its independence. Brian Mulroney, a board member and former prime minister of Canada, said at the time that ADM's independent directors ""are fully independent and have the utmost integrity.""

McDonald's Corp dominates the landscape with about 12,000 U.S. units and over 20,000 worldwide. But in spite of a new menu, its U.S. same-store sales are below year-ago levels.
""This will be their sixth consecutive quarter of lower comps (same store sales) in the U.S.,"" Dean Witter analyst David Adelman said, referring to the fourth quarter of 1996.
Wendy's International Inc, on the other hand, has seen U.S. same store sales rise five to six percent in the fourth quarter, following an eight percent gain in the third quarter. Spokesman Denny Lynch declined to comment.
""Wendy's..., although their margins have been squeezed, has the best traffic of the big three,"" said Roger Lipton of Lipton Financial Services.
Wendy's has about 4,425 U.S. units and 4,925 worldwide.
Burger King, a unit of Grand Metropolitan Plc, said its U.S. same-store sales rose 2.6 percent for fiscal 1996 ended September 30.
Burger King had 8,696 units worldwide at the end of fiscal 1996, including more than 6,600 in the United States.
At this point, Wendy's may have the most significant new product offering in 1997, a fresh pita sandwich that is currently being tested in 11 U.S. markets and may be rolled out nationally next year, analysts said.
""It's being given very serious consideration,"" Lynch said of pita sandwiches. ""We're very pleased with the test.""
Adelman said he expects the pita sandwich to be launched in the United States later in 1997, adding, ""That's going to be a material event for (Wendy's).""
In 1996, McDonald's stole the menu spotlight by introducing its Arch Deluxe hamburger, garnished with lettuce, tomato and a mustard-mayonnaise sauce, as well new chicken and fish deluxe sandwiches.
In spite of those new menu items, McDonald's same store sales continued to show declines compared with a year ago.
McDonald's U.S. same store sales showed a negative comparison in the first nine months of 1996, spokesman Chuck Ebeling said, but he declined comment on the fourth quarter.
McDonald's has blamed the drop in its U.S. same store sales in part on an intensely competitive domestic market.
Looking ahead, analysts said the most significant event for McDonald's likely will be the start in 1997 of its 10-year exclusive marketing alliance with Walt Disney Co. That alliance gives McDonald's exclusive rights to marketing tie-ins -- such as toy giveaways -- to Disney movies.
Ebeling said the Disney alliance will be the ""centerpiece"" of McDonald's marketing efforts, ""but not the only thing.""
As for its menu, Ebeling said McDonald's will continue to focus on ""delivering great food taste,"" but he did not comment on new items.

1902,"Hong Kong business groups hit back on Wednesday at U.S. attempts to link China's most favoured nation (MFN) trading perks with how Beijing handles Hong Kong after it reverts to Chinese control later this year.
U.S. Congressman Jim Kolbe, leading a 22-member delegation from the House of Representatives to Beijing, said on Tuesday the United States will probably want to monitor Hong Kong for at least a year before granting China permanent MFN status.
""If MFN were conditioned or taken away, especially during the transition period, it would clearly have a devastating effect and make it much more likely that all the things we want for Hong Kong would not be achieved,"" said Mark Michelson, former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce.
China currently enjoys MFN, subject to annual review.
Hong Kong commentators noted that permanent MFN, which would allow China the same tariff treatment as other big U.S. trading partners without an annual review, was unlikely in 1997, the year that China takes back Hong Kong from Britain.
""It's unfortunate. Were it not for this being the year of the return of Hong Kong to China, I think it would have been an opportune time for the U.S. Congress to finally extend permanent MFN status,"" said Frank Martin, the American chamber president.
""But it is going to be difficult this year. Many members of Congress are very likely to want to take a wait-and-see attitude.""
Legislation on permanent MFN has been submitted to Congress but has not been voted on.
China, which argues full MFN status is essential for healthy Sino-U.S. relations, granted Kolbe's congressional delegation an interview with President Jiang Zemin on Tuesday.
Political analysts said Kolbe was committed to achieving permanent MFN status for China, but had tried to remind Beijing the United States wants to see a smooth handover in Hong Kong, where many are worried that China might impose repressive rule.
""Would a vote to tie MFN to the transition be a good idea? No,"" said one analyst, who declined to be identified.
""But to kind of use it one last time to signal concern while everyone knows annual MFN is going to go through doesn't hurt.""
As the leading entrepot for China-U.S. trade, the Hong Kong government has always backed China's application for MFN status. But on Wednesday it declined to comment on Kolbe's remarks.
China's annual application for MFN status goes to Congress in May. It has won approval every year since 1990.
However, former U.S. president George Bush was occasionally forced to use his presidential veto to eliminate various conditions that Congress attempted to attach.
U.S. President Bill Clinton, who accused Bush of coddling tyrants in the 1992 U.S. presidential election campaign debates, de-linked the annual review of MFN from China's human rights record in 1995.

1911,"The recent Asian tour by U.S. fund managers representing $234 billion in assets, including the hefty California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS), has whetted Hong Kong fund managers' appetites.
""CalPERS has this innate ability of raising everybody's blood pressure because they've got so much money to invest. Get one percent and you double your assets under management,"" said Stewart Aldcroft, sales director for Templeton.
But it appears Hong Kong fund managers might be waiting in vain for a slice of the CalPERS pie.
While expressing a desire to raise their Asian and international weightings, the United States pension funds clearly stated a preference for direct investment over listed equity.
""The amount of transparency that we would expect with the companies is not available at this point,"" CalPERS board president William Crist said of Chinese public companies.
His statement highlighted a significant problem for U.S. money managers seeking increased exposure to Asia.
Foreign access to Asian markets is usually restricted, partly because many countries fear the sort of economic disruption that widened current account deficits after the last wall of foreign money came marching into the region in 1993.
Hong Kong fund managers, pointing to research indicating superior Asian performance by funds managed from within the region rather than from outside, said one option that could meet everybody's needs is private equity funds.
The performance of these funds is private but believed to far exceed that of public mutual funds.
Marcus Thompson, deputy managing director of HSBC Private Equity Management, said his funds hold $560 million, virtually all of it contributed by U.S. pension funds and invested in small companies expected to list within 10 years.
""Over the long term you're likely to get a superior investment performance,"" Thompson said. ""There's a discount for not being able to trade the stock.""
Cesar Zalamea, managing director of AIG Investment Corp (Asia) Ltd, declined to reveal the performance of his funds except to describe it as ""tremendous"".
AIG is the biggest private equity group active in Asia, with $2.38 billion under management -- nearly all of it rumoured to be contributed by one or two very big U.S. pension clients.
Zalamea said AIG's policy is always to hire Western-educated nationals who know the culture and the players in the indigenous business community. Established in Shanghai in 1919, AIG also has long-term relationships with many Asian corporations.
""When these (Asian corporations) decide they want to expand and invite investors outside family and close friends, we are naturals to be invited because (they) already know us,"" Zalamea said. ""CalPERS wouldn't have the kind of relationship.""
But there are disadvantages to private equity funds, the most obvious being their closed-end and long-term nature.
""One of the key issues about investment is to have your money back when you're ready to have it back, not when those in whom you are investing want you to have it back,"" said Aldcroft, who candidly admits Templeton wants to manage CalPERS money.
Another fund manager warned that while many venture capital funds do very well, others do not.
""The risk is higher. You don't have an out. The trick is in knowing how to say no,"" he said. ""If you haven't picked the right companies, how do you get out?""

""We did recognise at a very early stage that there was a certain amount of risk we could accommodate within the joint venture vehicle,"" said NatWest Markets' newly appointed chairman for Asia Pacific, John Howland-Jackson.
""We were perhaps not bargaining on a series of events around the world in a variety of traded markets that would cause such scrutiny of trading businesses,"" he said. ""The whole environment has tightened up considerably.""
Terms and details of the deal were not disclosed, but Howland-Jackson said both partners had contributed US$125 million in capital towards the joint venture before the shareholders went their different ways.
The move followed last month's announcement that NatWest Markets was pulling out of the fund management arm of the joint venture because of its acquisition of British pension giant Gartmore Plc  earlier in the year.
""I think that might have caused some disagreement between the shareholders,"" said Vincent Kwan, analyst at Vickers Ballas.
But representatives of both companies denied that termination clauses in the original joint venture deal signed in May 1994 were enacted.
Nicholas Sibley, managing director of Wheelock Capital, said his company had no immediate plans to replace the joint venture with another financial services subsidiary, but instead would focus on its goal to act as a bridge between China and the rest of the world.
""Financial services isn't the first thing that comes to mind,"" he said, but declined to elaborate.
Analysts warned that although the break-up will not affect Wheelock's earnings, it could signify a substantial strategic setback for a company with stated plans to diversify its earnings base away from Asia's volatile property sector.
""They've always said they wanted four major operating divisions by the year 2000 and financial services was going to be one of them,"" said another analyst, who declined to be identified.
""Now that the joint venture is gone some people may be wondering what the commitment is to diversifying the earnings base.""
Some analysts said the joint venture had failed to perform as well as expected, and company projections of a break-even date by the end of 1997 were unduly optimistic.
""Investment banking in Asia is a very competitive market,"" one analyst said.

1927,"Hong Kong Financial Secretary Donald Tsang painted a rosy picture of an expanding economy on Thursday, just two weeks before he presents the budget that will straddle the territory's handover to Chinese rule.
With economic growth forecast at 5.5 percent this year and the trade picture improving, Hong Kong's economy is well positioned ahead of the territory's transition from British to Chinese sovereignty on July 1, Tsang said.
""Hong Kong will start life as a Special Administrative Region (of China) in sound economic shape, with every prospect that we will remain the most attractive business location in this region,"" Tsang told a Hong Kong Investment Fund Association lunch.
Tsang is due to release the annual budget on March 12.
He revealed the government's economic forecasts but declined to disclose its fiscal reserves or comment on an expected fiscal surplus of up HK$20 billion (US$2.56 billion), substantially higher than a prior government forecast of HK$1.6 billion.
""It makes good sense to separate clearly our economic forecasts from the annual budget,"" he said.
""To maintain our position as a major centre for international business, entrepreneurs and investors need prompt access to the best information on our current performance and our future prospects,"" he said.
Tsang said improvements in foreign trade and rising domestic demand would continue to support Hong Kong's economy through 1997, following a turnaround in the middle of last year.
Consumption and investment were the primary drivers behind last year's recovery, aided by an unemployment rate that fell to 2.6 percent and inflation capped at 6.7 percent, he said.
Private consumption is expected to rise still further by 5.5 percent this year, he said.
The massive airport construction project and public housing programmes boosted investment levels in 1996, as did private sector activity in building and construction, he said.
""The feel-good factor returned in the middle of 1996,"" Tsang told reporters after his speech.
While investment rates are set to fall this year as the Chek Lap Kok airport project nears completion, Hong Kong's economy should continue to leap ahead, thanks to an improving trade picture that will benefit from steady or high growth rates in the United States, Europe and East Asia, he said.
""We expect the economy to perform significantly better than last year,"" Tsang said. ""The improved performance will be generated by faster growth in both domestic demand and foreign trade. We also expect confidence levels to remain high in 1997.""
Exports of goods are forecast to rise 8.5 percent this year against a decline of eight percent last year. Exports of services are expected to grow eight percent in 1997 against a rise of six percent last year.
Although domestic exports should remain static, re-exports should rise 10 percent this year compared with eight percent last year, Tsang said.
Although private consumption growth indicates greater confidence in the territory's future, Tsang warned that Hong Kong was experiencing an increase in price pressure that would push up the benchmark consumer price index (A) by seven percent in 1997 from an inflation rate of 6.7 percent in 1996.
""That is our forecast at this moment,"" he told reporters. ""It will be revised in the middle of the year... I think that seven percent is a reasonable estimate.""

1932,"Foreign cash is holding steady in Thailand, hoping for economic and stock market recovery even though there are few signs of either so far.
""I think a lot of fund managers will be doing a lot of wishful thinking, but at the end of the day I don't think (Thailand) will be going anywhere in a hurry,"" Christopher Day, joint managing director at Thornton Management (Asia) Ltd said.
Most funds appeared to be neutral on Thailand against Morgan Stanley's widely-used Far East Asia ex-Japan free index.
Salomon Brothers said last week that research data suggested funds were neutral to overweight, while Nomura Research Institute said funds were neutral to underweight.
Thailand stock exchange data suggested a one-percent retail fund sell-off in October brought most funds into neutral.
""The worst should be over, both in terms of politics and economics,"" said Stephen Leung, BZW Asia's chief investment officer.
Investor nervousness has abated somewhat following the recent election of a new coalition government headed by the New Aspiration Party. But most commentators agreed the immediate direction of Thailand's SET index, which closed on Friday at 970.30 compared to a year-high of 1,402.81, depends on the announcement of cabinet appointments and new economic measures.
""There's a good chance we'll have a little rally back up to, say, 1,000 if (coalition leader) Chavalit Yongchaiyudh brings good people into his cabinet,"" said Christine Rowley, investment manager with LGT Asset Management in Hong Kong.
Rowley also said the SETI has performed strongly through December and January every year for 10 years.
""There's a very high seasonality element in Thailand,"" she said. ""So we might see some little rally ... but I expect foreigners to sell into that and bring the market back down again, maybe even lower than it has been before.""
Others agreed that more selling can be expected with funds assuming an underweight position while Thailand grapples with gaping trade and current account deficits, a slump in corporate earnings and a weak bank sector.
""Further market downside exists, though the extent of a decline will not be large,"" Nomura said in a research report.
Poor corporate earnings are considered the prime culprit. Jardine Fleming has reduced its corporate earnings forecast for 1996 to four percent from 14 percent, following a decline in price-earnings ratios to 16 from 18 earlier in the year.
Offsetting the bad news are falling inflation, some hopes of improved export competitiveness next year and expectations of better trade and current accounts on a decline in imports.
""Without the new measures, without an improvement in the current account deficit, we think the market will find it difficult to break through the 1,000 level,"" said Patrick Wong, investment director at Jardine Fleming Unit Trusts.
Wong is expecting some turnaround in the first or second quarters of 1997, partly because slower imports will ease the trade deficit and improve the current account deficit.
Most agree improvements in a current account deficit of seven percent of gross domestic product are needed before Thailand can turn around. But there is considerable scepticism about common forecasts of an economic and stock market recovery within six months.
""It's been six months away for a long time now. Lo and behold, the second quarter of 1997 is also conveniently six months away,"" Rowley said.

1936,"Regulations issued by Indonesia earlier this year promoting the creation of mutual funds have become a landmark for the local industry, delegates to a conference said on Wednesday.
""The recognition of open-end funds or mutual funds by the Capital Market Law has been quite instrumental in the development of the Indonesian investment fund industry over the past few months,"" said Melli Darsa of the law firm Hadiputranto, Hadinoto and Partners in Jakarta.
Darsa was one of several fund experts attending a mutual fund conference in Jakarta who predicted a bright future for the domestic industry, with seven open-end mutual funds already established and five more in the pipeline.
Indonesia released regulations in May outlining accounting methods, reporting procedures and valuation methods for open-end mutual funds, which were allowed for the first time by the country's 1995 Capital Market Law.
The new legal framework gives Indonesia an edge, placing it half-way between the high risk and reward markets in China and India and the most exciting developed countries, most of which have hostile tax regimes, said Anthony Travers of the Hong Kong law firm Maples and Calder.
""In many respects, Indonesia is a halfway house,"" Travers told the conference. ""Indonesia has a much more developed (financial) infrastructure than China and India.""
But delegates saw significant obstacles ahead, including an almost complete ignorance of mutual funds among Indonesians, high-yielding bank deposits that lure domestic savings away from Jakarta's illiquid stock market, and restrictions on foreign investment.
Although Indonesian pension funds hold nearly US$2.4 billion they are prohibited from investing overseas, prompting some foreign fund managers to question the benefits of establishing Indonesian subsidiaries that will be restricted to managing domestic funds onshore.
But government officials made it clear that the purpose of the new rules was to persuade Indonesians to invest at home to spur development of domestic capital markets.
""We want to enhance domestic self-sufficiency. That is why you can only invest in Indonesian securities or new offerings,"" said Iwan Pontjowinoto, president director of P.T. Danareksa Fund Management, a state-controlled finance company that launched the first of the new open funds.
""We want to have local funds that can help the government by investing in the stock market,"" he said.
The new funds can only invest in domestic securities and are prohibited from selling more than one percent of their shares or units to any one investor, ensuring a wide investor base.
The new rules also ensure the funds are broadly invested, prohibiting them from spending more than 10 percent of their net asset value on any one company or buying securities representing more than five percent of the issuer's paid-up capital.
The conference, which attracted about 40 delegates from fund management companies, law firms, rating agencies and fund custodians around Asia, ended on Wednesday with a workshop on how to structure and price mutual funds.

1938,"Zero tax and limited regulation are luring billions of dollars into offshore mutual funds, spurring a growth industry in famed tax-free locations such as the Cayman Islands, according to a mutual fund legal expert.
""I think every indication is that the offshore part of the mutual fund industry will grow. In the offshore jurisdiction you have no taxation and a more appropriate level of regulation as a rule of thumb,"" said Anthony Travers, senior partner at Maples and Calder in Hong Kong.
Anecdotal evidence suggests these advantages have drawn nearly US$900 billion into offshore mutual funds so far out of an entire industry sometimes valued at US$5 trillion, he said.
A lack of professional infrastructure is often a compelling disincentive to authorising funds in countries offering the greatest returns, while high taxation levels deter mutual funds from setting up in promising developed markets, he said on Friday.
The alternative is to authorise the fund in an offshore region, avoiding tax while reaching into some of the world's most rewarding investment regions.
There are, however, drawbacks.
""If you go offshore and you invest into the onshore jurisdiction from your mutual funds, you have things like withholding tax and tax treatments that may be imposed on your profits, and marketing is very much an issue,"" Travers said.
Certain double tax treaty networks can allow investors to avoid some onshore tax requirements, but these treaties vary from country to country, as do marketing restrictions, he said. For example, offshore mutual funds are prevented from marketing to more than 100 investors in the United States, while the United Kingdom prohibits marketing of offshore retail mutual funds unless they are based in designated jurisdictions, such as Bermuda, Jersey and Guernsey.
It is possible to market a Cayman Islands-registered mutual fund in the United Kingdom, but only as a private placement and not as a retail fund, Travers said.
Despite their obvious benefits, Travers warned that investing in offshore mutual funds is not for everyone.
The lack of regulation gives greater flexibility in the establishment and administration of mutual funds but it also provides little recourse for unsophisticated retail investors, which partly explains why these funds cannot be marketed freely in the United States or the United Kingdom.
""You are essentially talking about mutual funds which are established by institutions for other institutions or very high net worth and sophisticated individuals, in which case it is felt additional layers of regulation are not appropriate or necessary,"" he said.
It is possible to market offshore retail funds in Europe, but funds must meet the requirements of the ""Undertakings of Collective Investment and Transfer of Securities"" (UCITS) directive, which ensures certain standards are met.
""They are supposed to be able to sell UCITS cross-border in Europe but in fact the European Union is still something of a myth when it comes to cross-border marketing,"" Travers said.
""And you find in these jurisdictions commensurately higher fees. Three to six basis points on net asset value is the price you pay to market to the retail sector,"" he said.

1943,"Hong Kong is among the world's most efficient economies but its continued success as a global financial centre and entrepot is far from certain, Harvard-based economic adviser professor Jeffrey Sachs said on Monday.
Uncertainty associated with the British colony's return to Chinese rule next year could compromise Hong Kong's leading position as the world's most competitive economy behind Singapore, said Sachs, whose Harvard Institute of International Development produced the Global Competitiveness Report 1996.
""I'm not predicting doom and gloom,"" Sachs, an adviser on economic reform to governments around the world, told reporters at the World Economic Forum in Hong Kong.
""I'm just saying that if you want to maintain a high-precision, finely-honed, world-class financial and trading centre such as this there isn't that much room for playing around.""
Hong Kong will continue to flourish past the transition only if the rule of law is strictly observed, media freedoms are upheld and the economy remains completely open, he said.
But only time will tell whether the commercial underpinnings of Hong Kong's successful, highly-complex and capitalist economy will be maintained, he said.
""After Chinese sovereignty comes in July 1997 we're going to see whether the judicial system remains independent, whether the media remain free, whether there's ample opportunity for the full flow of financial and economic and political information that is vital for an entrepot of this kind,"" he said.
Sachs also adopted a cautious view of China's economic promise, warning that its economic institutions need drastic overhaul in order to maintain high rates of economic growth beyond the short-term.
""These institutions are not good enough to carry China toward long-term growth. China's dynamism now is undoubted and it's not going to come klunking to a halt, but it's based on the fact the starting point is so low,"" Sachs said.
Cheap labour, low taxation and access to foreign exchange along China's coastal regions have fuelled the world's most impressive exports boom, Sachs said. But in order for that momentum to be maintained, China must clarify property rights, develop financial markets and establish legal certainty.
""The Chinese government is going to have to run very fast and keep very clear sights on its goals in order ... for institutional change to keep up so that the goal of high growth can be sustained in the future,"" Sachs said.
A major obstacle to long-term success is the state enterprise sector, which employs 20 percent of the population. While it is not sufficiently large to submerge the entire economy, the state enterprise sector is a definite drag on the economy and poses a risk to the entire financial system, Sachs said.
Sachs lauded China's efforts so far to privatise businesses at the local and regional levels.
""Parts of China are reforming from the bottom up with local and regional governments making experiments in privatisation that can be models for the rest of China,"" he said.

1955,"China gave U.S. President Bill Clinton a signal on Sunday that the election had not cleared away nagging trade disputes, saying it planned tit-for-tat curbs on American imports.
Beijing said it would suspend temporarily its imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods and alcoholic drinks in retaliation for Washington's imposition of punitive charges on American purchases of Chinese textiles.
The announcement came only days after Clinton's re-election triumph and ahead of a planned visit to Beijing this month by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
Sino-U.S. relations have been strained over the last year by a range of issues from Taiwan to arms proliferation to trade and human rights.
China and the U.S. have said they saw an improvement in relations since the two sides narrowly averted a trade war over copyright piracy and exchanged diplomatic fire over Beijing's political rival, Taiwan, earlier this year.
Beijing said last week that it saw Clinton's re-election as a good opportunity for better ties in a ""somewhat improved atmosphere"".
The temporary import ban, which would take effect on December 10, was in retaliation for what China called severe violations by the U.S. of a bilateral textile accord.
""The decision was made in response to the U.S. unilateral cut of import quotas of Chinese textiles, which severely violated the bilateral textile agreement,"" the official Xinhua news agency said.
In September, Washington announced punitive charges against 1996 import quotas for Chinese textile goods, accusing China of using transshipments to avoid U.S. quota restrictions.
The action -- which was expected to cost China about $19 million -- marked the first time Washington had imposed so-called triple charges against repeated violations of a bilateral textile accord.
The U.S. move was made without full consultation and clear supporting evidence, Xinhua said.
Beijing accused Washington of imposing a series of barriers that had seriously affected Chinese textile export to the U.S. as well as China's ability to pay for American imports.
China said it had urged the U.S. to withdraw the penalties but its pleas had been ignored, leaving it no choice but to take action.
China's import suspension would also apply to U.S. fruits and animal husbandry products, though there was no indication of which specific items would be barred within the broad product categories.
The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation and the General Administration of Customs would have a detailed list ready before December 10, according to Xinhua.
China also said it opposed any attempt to impose the will of one side upon others in trade matters, and called on the U.S. to avoid such measures in future.
""Once again, we wish to urge the United States to handle trade disputes in the spirit of advancing bilateral trade, and refrain from taking any actions harmful to bilateral trade in the future,"" it said.

1959,"China on Tuesday announced a ban on poultry and poultry products from two U.S. states hit by an outbreak of a deadly disease.
The ban is already in effect and covers poultry from the states of Missouri and Oklahoma, an official of the Ministry of Agriculture told Reuters by telephone.
It was aimed at preventing damage from a ""very destructive disease"", the ministry official said.
The official said, however, that China had banned all U.S. poultry brought into the country either by mail or hand-carried by travellers.
""Travellers are barred from bringing in any poultry goods from the United States,"" he said. ""These products also cannot be brought into China through the mail.""
An official of the State Bureau of Animal Plant and Quarantine said the ban went into effect on Monday.
Official news reports said the ban was slapped on poultry products from the two states because of five cases of a deadly poultry flu discovered between July and September.
The quarantine official told Reuters that the action was unrelated to other trade disputes with the United States and there was no plan to delay implementation of the decision.
The virus in question, known as viscerotropic velogenic Newcastle disease, or VVND, is deadly, Phillip Holloway, representative in Hong Kong and China for the Oklahoma state agriculture department, told Reuters on Tuesday.
""It's a very, very dangerous disease -- the most feared of poultry diseases,"" he said. ""The symptoms are like influenza, and once one bird gets the disease, all the poultry will die.""
But Holloway said he had not heard of any recent cases of VVND in Oklahoma.
The last major outbreak of VVND in the United States occurred in California in the 1970s and led to the eradication of the state's entire poultry population, he said.
Beijing and Washington are also at odds over textile imports, and that dispute has threatened to spill over into the farm sector.
China had threatened to ban some U.S. farm goods -- as well as textiles and alcoholic drinks -- in retaliation for U.S. penalties on textiles purchased from China.
On Sunday, Beijing announced it was delaying for one month implementation of those restrictions, which had been scheduled to take effect on Tuesday, because the two sides were planning to hold further talks on the issue.
In October, China announced a ban on imports of poultry from 10 U.S. states because of fears the meat carried a virus called highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).
China and the United States held talks averting the ban, worth nearly $500 million a year.
China is the second-biggest market in the world, after Russia, for U.S. poultry products.
U.S. poultry exports to China in 1995 totalled 330,000 tonnes transshipped through Hong Kong and were worth $445 million, according to the U.S. Poultry and Egg Export Council.
Every day 700 tonnes of U.S. chicken feet are transported across the border from Hong Kong into China, according to the council.

1962,"China has tried to put new pressure on Taiwan to boost economic ties, courting the island's businessmen with an announcement of rules on direct shipping links, analysts said on Sunday.
But they said Beijing remained far from its goal of securing direct shipping, banned by the rival Nationalist government of Taiwan.
""From what we have seen, this already has put some pressure on the Taiwan authorities,"" said Fan Xizhou, head of the Taiwan Research Institute at Xiamen University.
""This could help stabilise economic ties but more practical steps are needed,"" he said, speaking by telephone from the southeastern port city that would likely benefit from any direct shipping links.
Beijing, which views the island as a renegade province, unilaterally announced last week a series of regulations on direct shipping links, giving its blue print for future trade.
Taiwan's Nationalist government has banned direct air and shipping links with China since 1949 when Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist troops lost the Chinese civil war to the communists and fled to the island.
With tensions easing since the late 1980s, civilian aircraft and vessels have skirted the ban by stopping over in a third country or territory such as the British colony of Hong Kong or Portuguese-run Macau.
Taiwanese businessmen, who have poured over $20 billion into China, are eager for direct transport links, but Taiwanese authorities have been reluctant to lift the ban.
The latest news fuelled hopes among many of Taiwan's businessmen that some of the restrictions might be eased, and it briefly buoyed shipping stocks on the Taipei bourse.
The Nationalists, who say they are committed to eventual reunification with China, see direct transport links as their last bargaining chip in talks with the communists.
China said that direct shipping would be purely a domestic matter, specifying that only Taiwanese or Chinese companies -- or joint ventures including one side or the other -- would be allowed to conduct business on the routes.
""The documents define clearly that direct cargo transport between harbours on the Chinese mainland and Taiwan is regarded as domestic transportation under special management,"" the official Xinhua news agency said.
They also make no mention of the role that Taiwan authorities would play, saying only that all companies engaged in the trade would need Beijing's permission.
Taiwan has set its own formula for future links but it wants to limit the trade to foreign registered companies through a so-called ""offshore"" southern port.
Beijing's tactics echo those applied to the British colony of Hong Kong, where it has tried to lure companies with substantial business interests in China to do its bidding politically while it engages in political arm-wrestling with the British administration.
In Hong Kong, at least, those tactics have been highly successful as many of the same tycoons who once courted the British administration have turned to Beijing to look for economic favours in return for their political support.
Whether that works with Taiwan remains to be seen.
""The new shipping rules were clearly designed to step up the pressure on Taiwan,"" said a Western diplomat.
""But if Taiwan doesn't agree, it's all empty talk.""

1966,"China should take advantage of easing inflation and switch its fund raising efforts to longer term bonds, an official newspaper said on Tuesday.
The Financial News, published by the central bank, said that the reduced interest rates meant that Beijing could lock in long-term funds at cheaper rates.
""Now that we are in a period of lower inflation, this is the time to shift to longer term maturities for government funds,"" the newspaper said.
China's retail price inflation rate slipped to 6.9 percent for the first seven months of the year, well below a target of 10 percent for the year and down sharply from the 14.8 percent for all of 1995.
That persuaded the central bank to cut bank interest rates once this year, and many analysts expect another rate reduction by the end of the year.
China also felt confident enough to eliminate a hefty subsidy on new bank deposits and government debt of more than three years as of April.
The subsidy, paid on top of the normal interest rate, was aimed at attracting investors during a period of high inflation.
The subsidy hit a peak of 13.24 percent in December of last year, paid in addition to interest of 12.24 for three-year bank deposits.
In 1995, China issued 151 billion yuan ($18.18 billion) in domestic treasury debt, representing 2.6 pct of its gross domestic product, according to the daily.
""The government had to raise interest rates on bonds and to give a subsidy on top of this. As a result, this increased the the cost of raising funds and the burden of repayment,"" the newspaper said.
In July, Beijing issued its first tranche of 10-year bonds. They paid annual interest of 11.83 percent but with no subsidy, making them a far cheaper way for the central government to raise funds.
""The advantage to the state is that it is simpler to manage,"" said Xu Hongyuan, an economist at the State Information Centre.
""From the investor's standpoint, the bonds are also quite attractive,"" he told Reuters.
The newspaper said in addition that China also had too much of its debt concentrated in three to five-year maturities, bunching up repayments and straining government finances unnecessarily.
""If we can rely on a certain amount of 10-year treasury bonds that will ease the problems,"" the newspaper said.

1968,"China on Thursday tried to play down friction with the United States over a rising trade gap and called on the U.S. to end curbs on technology exports to put trade back in balance.
""The two sides should avoid taking actions that do not help the expansion of trade,"" said a spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
""These are two of the biggest markets in the world,"" he said. ""They should be complementary.""
The United States said on Wednesday its trade deficit with China climbed to nearly $29 billion in the first nine months of the year, from $25 billion in the same period last year.
The trade gap, already the second largest for the U.S. after its deficit with Japan, was seen reaching $40 billion by the end of the year, up from $34 billion in 1995.
American economists said the mounting deficit was likely to create new frictions between the two countries.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor said the growth in the deficit with China had slowed, but he called on Beijing to live up to its international trade obligations.
A group of influential U.S. senators, in a letter to President Bill Clinton, questioned Beijing's trade practices and said China should not be allowed to join the World Trade Organisation on special terms because it would harm American economic interests.
Beijing has been seeking to join the global trade body on favourable terms given to developing nations, but Washington has insisted that China's economy was too big for this treatment.
The Chinese Trade Ministry spokesman said Washington's policy curbs on U.S. exports were part of the bilateral trade problem. ""There are policy rulings that are holding back U.S. exports,"" he said. ""Where there are limits on technology exports, this is a lost export opportunity for the United States.""
The U.S. appeared to be moving to address this matter.
On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Washington was considering allowing technical cooperation in peaceful uses of nuclear technology despite concerns about safeguards over re-exports.
Christopher, after meeting with Chinese leaders in Beijing, said the U.S. was looking at taking steps that eventually could allow American companies to sell their technology to China.
A Chinese economist suggested some of the criticism over trade was unfairly directed at China as U.S. imports were mainly labour intensive products that were not manufactured in the United States.
""If the U.S. does not buy these products from China it will buy them elsewhere,"" said Wang Jian, an economist with the State Planning Commission. ""These are goods produced by developing countries.""
But the economist conceded that bilateral trade problems could spill over into broader trade issues.
""The U.S. already is the main obstacle to China's plan to join the World Trade Organisation,"" he said, adding that renewed Sino-U.S. trade friction could further complicate the issue.

1969,"China could list more railway companies and is studying a plan to create a fund to boost foreign investment in the sector, a railway official said on Monday.
The moves would be aimed at bringing in cash to help modernise the nation's huge rail system and fend off competition from planes and buses, Ministry of Railways senior engineer Zhang Yanzhao said.
China's first railway stock offer -- the Guangshen Railway Co Ltd -- was being watched for its performance as a possible model for future offerings, Zhang told Reuters in an interview.
""If Guangshen is seen as successful, we could use the same method again,"" said Zhang, assistant director-general of the department for cooperation with foreign countries.
The Guangshen Railway links Guangzhou -- capital of fast growing Guangdong province -- with Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong.
In May, the company's shares were listed in Hong Kong and in New York as American Depositary Receipts.  
The offer was only a modest success, managing to hold just above its offer price. The Hong Kong shares were now trading at HK$2.925 ($0.38) each compared with an offer price of HK$2.91.
""Any operations listed in the future would have to be making money and would probably be along the east coast,"" Zhang said.
The key was corporatising the regional railway bureaus under the ministry's supervision. So far, only Guangzhou and Dalian in the northeast have taken this step.
Another form of financing under study is the creation of a fund that could offer fixed income to foreign investors.
""This is still far off,"" Zhang said without giving details.
The railways have long been the backbone of China's transport sector, but are now facing new competitive pressure for both freight and passenger markets.
Guangshen Railway had to cut ticket prices as of November to compete with bus traffic. The move was expected to hurt revenue and has already pressured the company's share price.
China's railways carried 448 million passengers in the first half of the year, down 14 percent from a year ago, according to official media reports.  
Zhang said that overall China's railways were profitable, although some routes were losing money. And overall, profits were not keeping up with past performances.
""As of last year, we have not been doing as well,"" he said without giving any figures.
Overstaffing was a key problem because the railway system has 3.3 million workers on its payrolls. But shedding jobs requires tough political decisions because unemployment is seen as a source of potential social unrest.
Government control over rail rates is also a problem. The ministry would like to raise rates but has little room to do so.
""This is a sensitive area,"" said Zhang.
The ministry is trying to speed up its trains, increase capacity and provide more comfortable passenger cars. It plans to expand electrified rail service to 28 percent of its capacity by 2000 from 19 percent now.
New plans for electric locomotive production are under discussion, and Switzerland's ABB AG and Germany's Siemens AG are among the top contenders.
Discussions are under way with Canada's Bombardier for joint production of modern passenger cars, and plans are moving ahead for a computerised, nationwide ticketing service.

But the fledgling network has found it hard to tackle a seasoned competitor -- one that is also the market regulator.
""Are they (the MPT) supposed to be the referee or one of the athletes on the playing field?"" asks Li Huifen, president of China United Telecommunications Corp, also known as Unicom.
The arrival of Unicom and the end of the MPT monopoly was initially hailed as a boost for China's long-suffering telephone subscribers, who often had to wait up to a year for a telephone line and endure indifferent service afterwards.
But Unicom has captured only a tiny slice of the market as its entrenched competitor has kept a tight grip on the telecommunications sector, using its regulatory clout to slow the upstart network's advance.
""They have delayed interconnections and won't give us telephone numbers for our customers,"" Li said in an interview. ""We need a telecommunications law to give us a legal framework.""
Unicom has 16 shareholders, but the key backers of the project were the ministries of electronics industry (MEI), power and railways.
MANUFACTURING MUSCLE
The MEI has manufacturing muscle with a corps of factories producing telecommunications equipment. But it feared the MPT's equipment-making capacity would eventually squeeze it out of the market unless it had its own captive customers.
The other key partners had private telecommunications networks with spare capacity, while the MPT's public network was heavily overcrowded.
The feud between the rival Chinese government camps was often bitter, sometimes ensnaring foreign companies. Firms that did business with the new network were threatened with blacklisting by the MPT, according to Western industry sources.
Those frictions have eased somewhat in recent months, but it still took an order from the State Council, or cabinet, for promised network interconnections to emerge.
China expects to have more than 60 million telephone lines installed by the end of this year -- adding a breathtaking 10 million in 1996 alone. The total is likely to top 100 million by the turn of the century, still only a small segment of the nation's 1.2 billion people.
MPT says it should not be considered a competitor to Unicom because it has a separate operating arm called China Telecom.
""Since 1993, we have separated policy making from business operations by creating China Telecom,"" said an MPT spokesman. ""The MPT is not both regulating and competing,"" he said, blaming Unicom's slow progress on its own technical problems.
STRUGGLE TO BE IMPARTIAL
But China Telecom officials concede it is hard to say where one entity ends and the other begins. And even if they can draw the line cleanly, the MPT must struggle to remain impartial.
""They always say they are being fair,"" said Unicom's Li. ""But China Telecom is their own child, and parents are always partial to their own children.""
Li took up the Unicom reins in August, becoming the third president in the company's brief history. She was tapped from her job as deputy mayor of the big industrial city of Tianjin to put political clout behind the second network.
The company started with mobile telephone services, first in the big cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Guangzhou, and eventually expanded to 16 cities. It has made its greatest inroads in Shanghai where it has about 20,000 mobile phone customers, Li said.
""In 10 years we will have 10 percent of the fixed line market and 30 percent of the mobile phone market,"" Li said.
One clear success has been in bringing mobile telephone prices down. They now cost 7,000 to 10,000 yuan ($840 - $1,200) compared with 10,000 to 20,000 yuan before Unicom came along.
Li says Unicom is profitable on its operations, but that excludes heavy investments in building network infrastructure. Despite the cost of putting a network in place, Unicom has one advantage. Foreigners are not permitted to operate telecommunications networks in China, and many foreign firms give Unicom capital in return for a share of the income.
That will at least ease the growing pains for the infant network, analysts said.

1974,"The Stone Group, a Chinese high technology company, plans to inject assets into its Stone Electronic unit to boost trading in the Hong Kong-listed firm, a top group official said.
The asset injections could begin next year as the Hong Kong company recovers from its steep slide in profits in 1995, president Duan Yongji told Reuters.
""We want to expand our float,"" Duan said in an interview late on Tuesday.
""We don't have enough stock on the market. Many investors say 'you are not big enough',"" he said, adding that more shares would be sold once the assets were injected into the listed vehicle.
The plan requires a sharp reduction in the price-to-earnings ratio of the company's stock -- now at about 23 -- to about 10.
Duan said a sharp rise in earnings expected this year and in 1997 would help to set the stage for the plan.
The Beijing-based Stone Group Corp listed shares in 1993 with a HK$300 million ($38 million) flotation for Stone Electronic Technology Ltd.
The group still has a controlling 57 percent stake in the Hong Kong company, which makes integrated word processors and printers and distributes a wide range of products, including computers as well as office and lighting equipment.
Stone Group now has 18 joint ventures and it plans to start placing some of those assets into the listed firm.
""We are preparing to inject some of the profitable companies into that vehicle,"" Duan said.
Stone Group probably will inject a large part of its 40 percent stake in a $60 million China-based joint venture with Matsushita of Japan to produce light fixtures. The plant has required heavy start-up costs but should be profitable next year, Duan said.
Stone Group also has a stake in a $1.6 billion semiconductor project with Mitsubishi Electric and Mitsui in China, although that will not begin production until late 1997 or early 1998.
Stone, one of the success stories of China's electronics industry, was started with a loan of 20,000 yuan ($2,400) in 1984.
""We used to compete with just the little guys,"" said Duan.
""That has changed dramatically in recent years,"" he said, adding that all major multi-nationals were now in the domestic market as China has relaxed its once-tight curbs on imports.
""Technology is also changing rapidly so we have to make use of our capital,"" the executive said. ""We can't let it stand still.""
Stone Electronic's profits slumped to HK$17 million in 1995 from HK$63.88 million in 1994. But earnings for the first half of this year were up 44 percent over the year-ago period to HK$10.22 million.
""I can't give a profit figure for all of this year but the full year growth will be better than first-half growth,"" Duan said, adding that 1997 should continue that trend.
Stone sees specialised electronic products for the banking system and tax collection as areas where it has major advantages over its competitors.
The parent company has also diversified into finance, setting up securities and futures trading operations and investing in a bank. Income from financial operations already has exceeded the company's electronics business. ($1= 8.3 yuan) ($1= 7.8 Hong Kong dollars)

1976,"China's central bank chief has said that inflation would be a modest seven percent this year and this showed the state's economic policies were working.
But Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China, lashed out at companies that had taken advantage of tight money policies used to tackle inflation by lending money at excessively high rates.
""The appropriately tight monetary polices have achieved clear results which have been acknowledged both in China and abroad,"" Dai was quoted as saying in the Financial News on Monday.
""We can now control inflation to about seven percent for the full year,"" he said.
China's retail inflation stood at 6.9 percent year-on-year in the first seven months and at 5.9 percent in July alone.
Beijing has said it wanted to keep inflation within 10 percent for 1996, down from 14.8 percent last year and a communist-era high of 21.7 percent in 1994.
But the central bank chief had harsh words for companies that had taken advantage of the tough austerity programme put in place three years ago to deal with the worst days of inflation.
He did not name any of the offenders but he said that some ""monopoly groups"" and publicly listed companies were lending out money at excessively high rates.
Tsingtao Brewery, which has stock listed in Hong Kong as well as in Shanghai, has run afoul of regulatory authorities in the British colony in the past for lending out funds raised from its public offer.
A senior Chinese economist who asked not to be named said several big ministries were cash-rich and able to earn more than bank deposit rates by lending out their funds.
""The big offenders are some cash-rich ministries,"" said the economist. ""They can earn 16-18 percent on their money.""
That would compare with interest of 7.47 percent earned on one-year bank deposits.
Other economists have said that higher rates were available for even more speculative lending.
Dai gave no indication of whether any measures were being planned to address these problems, although he said that funds in the banking system were unevenly distributed.
He said that China had already taken steps to curb illegal money market trade and that it had taken steps to ensure that other unauthorised financial organisations did not act as commercial banks.
""There are many violations of financial regulations,"" Dai was quoted as saying. ""There must be an expansion of supervision over the financial sector.""

1983,"China needs to extend bank credits to help boost its flagging export sector, a top trade official was quoted as saying on Sunday.
Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi wanted commercial and subsidised bank credits, particularly for machinery and electrical equipment makers, the Financial Daily reported.
""First of all, I believe that the state should expand the size of its export lending,"" Wu said.
""It should maximize its use of domestic credits, finding new sources of credit, and expand use of foreign loans to boost exports of complete plants and equipment.""
China's exports for the first eight months of the year were $90.61 billion, down 4.2 percent over the previous year, according to official figures.
Exports in July and August showed an improvement, however, after the government speeded up long delayed payments of export rebates.
Wu said commercial banks should be encouraged to make policy loans that might not be commercially attractive, and that state subsidies would be required.
""We want to encourage commercial banks to take on policy loans. With the assistance of the Export-Import Bank, the state will implement necessary financial subsidies,"" she said.
The minister said that big, turnkey projects required large amounts of capital and lengthy periods before they were completed.
While the projects were in progress, exporters had to deal with inflationary cost pressures, exchange rate fluctuations and tax rebate delays.
""In order to expand exports of complete plants and equipment we need an overall system to provide financial security for these companies,"" she said.
""This will effectively encourage exports of machinery and complete plants and equipment.""
Wu said she was confident China could reach its total trade goal of $281 billion this year, though she gave no figure for exports.

1984,"China's once strained ties with the United States have improved dramatically in recent months with a series of top level visits healing some of the old wounds.
But as the two nations move closer, the United States is sidestepping one of China's most sensitive figures -- Premier Li Peng -- who is still too closely linked to the 1989 crushing of pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, diplomats said on Sunday.
They said that Li is one Chinese leader who does not fit into the agenda for a visit to Washington.
""It may be a bit unfair but he is the one leader everyone remembers for his role in the (1989) crackdown,"" said a senior foreign diplomat.
Last month U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher made his first visit to China in two years, setting the stage for the series of meetings between other high ranking officials of the two countries.
During Christopher's visit, the two sides reached an understanding that their relationship should not be side-tracked by any one issue. That meant contacts would proceed despite continued disagreements over a range of issues from human rights, to trade and China's political rivalry with Taiwan.
Chinese Minister of Defence Chi Haotian is now in the United States after twice delaying a visit -- both times due to tension over Taiwan. He met President Bill Clinton on Monday last week.
Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin held talks at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in the Philippines last month, and an exchange of visits by the two leaders is planned over 1997 and 1998.
U.S. Vice President Al Gore is expected to visit China some time during the first half of next year.
But there is no talk yet of a return visit to the United States by Premier Li, Gore's counterpart in the Chinese government.
U.S. officials in Beijing played down the lack of an invitation, saying the timing of the Gore visit itself had not been set.
Other foreign analysts said an invitation would be made but there was little chance of a visit before a new premier takes office in 1998.
China is expected to sort out its leadership line-up at the Communist Party congress late next year and then formally install new government figures at the parliament meeting in March 1998.
""They (the Americans) seem to be waiting for the selection of the next premier,"" said another foreign diplomat.
Western leaders, including Americans, have been willing to meet Li in China. But for some of them, hosting him in their own country is another matter, diplomats said.
Li has been tarred with the decision to use military force to crush the pro-democracy protests in Beijing in 1989, though paramount leader Deng Xiaoping was the only man with sufficient clout to order in the army.
President Jiang was also elevated to his role as Communist Party chief because of his tough stance on dissent.
Li has not visited the United States, the United Kingdom or Australia since 1989. He has travelled to Germany, France and Canada since then, though he has been dogged by controversy on each trip.

1985,"China has vowed to wind up the lengthy probe of the disgraced former boss of Beijing, saying the case had seriously damaged the Communist Party in the nation's capital.
Beijing party chief Chen Xitong stepped down in April last year, only weeks after his protege and vice-mayor Wang Baosen was targeted in a probe of economic crimes and committed suicide.
""The cases of Chen and Wang absolutely will not just fade away,"" the Outlook magazine quoted Beijing's current party chief, Wei Jianxing, as saying.
""These cases have had a very bad effect on municipal affairs.. and have destroyed a number of comrades in the party,"" it quoted Wei -- the Communist Party's top graft fighter -- as saying.
The weekly magazine, published by the official Xinhua news agency, carried the remarks in its latest edition, seen in Beijing on Wednesday.
The 66-year-old Chen has been out of the public eye since his fall from grace, becoming the most prominent victim of a campaign against corruption.
He was deprived of his seat on the party's powerful Politburo and was officially said to be under investigation for ""serious mistakes"".
Unpublished party documents say that Chen, who ran Beijing for 12 years, first as mayor and then as party chief, had abused his office by amassing $24 million in unauthorised funds and lavishing favours on friends, associates and a long-time mistress.
Vice-mayor Wang was found to have used his position to obtain 116 houses illegally and built himself a villa on the outskirts of the city. He also masterminded a $37 million embezzlement and graft scam, officials have said.
The inability of investigators to announce a conclusion to their investigation had triggered much speculation, particularly in the case of Chen who was said to be refusing to cooperate and was threatening to implicate others.
It also contrasted sharply with the speedy trial and sentencing last week of dissident Wang Dan, who was jailed for 11 years on subversion charges after less than four hours in a Beijing courtroom.
The magazine also said that 22 people had been linked to the probe of the late vice-mayor, including Zhou Beifang, the former chairman of Hong Kong listed affiliates of a major Chinese steel company, and Chen Xitong's secretary, Chen Jian.
Earlier this month, prosecutors filed corruption charges against 30 people, including Zhou, who was detained in February last year.
The magazine also said that a former senior member of the Beijing city assembly, Tie Ying, had been arrested and expelled from the party earlier this year for accepting a large bribe from a Hong Kong businessman. It did not give further details.
The city government had been virtually paralysed since the disgrace of Chen and Wang, Chinese sources have said.
The campaign to clean up the Beijing administration was widely believed to have been a factor in the departure last week of Li Qiyan as mayor.
Corruption was virtually eliminated in the years after the communists came to power in 1949, but has staged a comeback along with economic reforms in the past 17 years.
Communist Party chief and state president Jiang Zemin has declared war on corruption, warning that the scourge was a virus that threatened the party.
Courts frequently impose the death penalty in major corruption cases.

1992,"A Chinese appeals court, in a rare move, sharply reduced on Friday to five years a prison sentence for an International Monetary Fund (IMF) employee accused of corruption.
The court's decision followed a brief suspension of technical assistance by the IMF and a Beijing visit by IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus to voice concern over what he described as judicial shortcomings in the case.
The Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court sentenced Hong Yang, 44, a Chinese national, to five years in prison for accepting bribes totalling 100,000 yuan ($12,000) in 1993, before he joined the IMF, the Xinhua news agency said.
""The sentence was dealt with leniently... and according to law,"" Xinhua quoting the court as saying on Friday.
Hong, a former employee of the People's Bank of China, or central bank, was arrested in December while on an IMF mission to China. He was found guilty on June 28.
Beijing sources said the original sentence was for 10 years, although statements by the IMF in Washington put it at 11 years. Hong appealed.
Chinese courts rarely cut sentences on appeal, though an admission of guilt may lead to more lenient treatment.
Camdessus has confirmed reports that Chinese authorities pressured the IMF to include Hong, who had been working at the international organisation's headquarters in Washington, on a mission to China.
The Chinese actions created a furore at the IMF and Camdessus said in a letter to the organisation's staff he would closely monitor a second trial.
""I also urged that the second open trial be transparent and complete and remedy the shortcomings of the first trial,"" Camdessus said after he visited Beijing last month.
Xinhua did not mention the original trial but it highlighted the legality and openness of the second.
It said the case was put on open trial on August 9 and that Hong, his two defence lawyers and four witnesses appeared in court and were involved in the proceedings.
It also said that 200 people, including Hong's relatives and IMF officials, were present.
It added that the man accused of offering the bribe, Fan Honggen, and other individuals from the Agricultural Bank would be dealt with in a separate case. It did not give further details.

2003,"Hordes of aggressive telephone resellers banging at the gates of AT&amp;T Corp, Sprint Corp and MCI Communications Corp have already grabbed $12 billion of the $80 billion long distance market.
But Monday's merger between MFS Communications Co Inc and WorldCom Inc allows tiny resellers to swarm into a rich citadel industry giants see as their own.
""Its international services, data, Internet and intranet as well as local service resale,"" said analyst Daryl Edmonds of brokers Bear Stearns.  
MFS is a provider of local calling networks to businesses, while WorldCom is a long distance and international carrier.
MFS WorldCom will be a ferocious competitor itself, able to offer end-to-end business services, but as a carrier's carrier it will allow in many resellers to new markets, by offering ""own brand"" telecommunication services off the shelf.
Fast growing resellers like Excel Communications Inc, one of over 400 such firms in the industry, have helped to eat away at the long distance telephone market and set the standard for cheap service, analysts say.  
For long distance companies, and regional Bells trying to defend their home turf, it will mean more competition, more pressure on margins and harder work to keep customers.
Profit margins and growth rates in high speed data, dedicated access Internet, international calling and broadband applications like videoconferencing are way beyond that seen in long distance, which is becoming a commodity market.
Resellers would threaten future sources of growth for the biggest firms in the industry.  
""You now have one company, MFS WorldCom, which crystallizes the brave new world (of competition),"" said Simon Flannery of brokers J. P. Morgan.
He said resellers could always have pieced together such services, but this merger will make it easier.
Resellers focused on consumer services will not even be competing with MFS WorldCom's own branded product, which is pitched at small businesses.
UUNET, which MFS bought for $2 billion earlier this month, will be particularly empowered as a carrier of the internet services of others.  
As part of MFS WorldCom it will be able to call on 2,900 sales people across the country instead of 63.
""We think it is a very positive move for the reseller market place,"" MFS WorldCom chief executive designate Bernard Ebbers said during Monday's merger news conference, mentioning Excel and GTE Corp as possible buyers of services.
GTE and some regional Bells are already buying long distance services from WorldCom for their entry into that market. Using MFS's networks, they could now extend local services into cities in other parts of the country.  
This new competition is one of the aims of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, but the irony is this merger -- of an outsider in long distance and an outsider in local telephone -- could have happened even without deregulation.
""Both companies were unencumbered by national regulation,"" said Edmonds though he noted that to reach the greatest market opportunity they still need access to some elements of the Bell's local networks, a process eased by the telecom act.
""MCI or Sprint will say 'we can do this too',"" said Flannery.
However, they are some way behind in their reach.
MCI this morning detailed its local phone service plans, but its MCI Metro network will only reach 25 cities by March 1997, while MFS already has 45 cities up and running.
However, analysts reckon it will be some time before MFS WorldCom can become a threat in the really high margin areas of dealing with the national or global communication accounts of large companies.

2005,"WorldCom Inc's audacious $14 billion takeover of MFS Communications Co Inc on Monday has both thrilled and unnerved share analysts.
They are thrilled by the strategy of one combined company beating industry giants to offer end-to-end business services, but some are worried by the MFS price tag and the danger of diluting WorldCom's hitherto rocket-like earnings trajectory.
""Strategically it is an extremely good move. It is likely to be the first to market such an offering for businesses,"" said analyst Guy Woodlief of Dean Witter Reynolds.  
""It will give WorldCom a breadth of services to business unmatched in the telecommunications industry,"" said Robert McNamara, a mergers and acquisitions advisor at consultants Broadview Associates.
I think there is some great strategic vision here,"" said Kevin Moore, analyst at brokers Alex Brown. He this morning upgraded his rating on the stock to strong buy from neutral.
Analysts have not finalised calculations, which are complicated by MFS's only-recently completed acquisition of Internet access company UUNET, but they say that on an earnings basis the deal looks extremely dilutive for WorldCom.  
""I would describe the price as a dizzying multiple, 20 times trailing earnings,"" said Bill Vogel of Dillon Read.
Most of the damage is done by huge new amortization charges -- $400 million a year for goodwill paid by MFS for UUNET, and $200 million a year for goodwill paid by WorldCom for MFS itself. WorldCom itself normally only pays $130 million a year in amortization.
Bernard Ebbers, WorldCom chief executive and chief executive of the new entity MFS WorldCom, said the new company should now be valued on a discounted cash flow basis, not on an earnings basis.  
""WorldCom has traditionally been very focused on earnings, price earnings multiples and anti-dilutive deals. They have crossed a very significant barrier here,"" said McNamara.
Woodlief said the company was now trading at 11 times cashflow for the new entity, instead of 10 times cashflow for WorldCom on its own, but with better cash flow growth rates now in prospect.
""The stock looks very attractive at this level,"" Woodlief said. ""Its only an issue of shareholder perception. You are paying a higher premium for a higher growth rate.""
Moore forecast that once WorldCom's management team does the rounds of investors in the next few days, the stock would bounce back.
""They are a very persuasive management team,"" Moore said. -- Nick Louth, New York Newsroom  212 859 1712

WorldCom chief executive Bernard Ebbers acknowledged that there was a substantial premium in the stock terms offered for MFS but said savings would soon cover the cost of the deal.
""It is not to say that price isn't important, but it really depends on how quickly you pay for it,"" Ebbers told Reuters in an interview on Monday.  
MFS, with local networks in dozens of major U.S. cities, was in a unique position to outflank the regional Bell's lock on access to local business customers. It was in a position to get the terms it wanted.
""There aren't a lot of MFS's out there,"" Ebbers said.
""He (Ebbers) had the only one sizeable company to merge with whose stock we really wanted (to own),"" James Crowe, chief executive of MFS, told reporters.
WorldCom stock soared a heady 57 percent a year over the last ten years. MFS has grown 41 percent a year in the three years since it was floated.  
Ebbers said savings and new market opportunities would mean the deal would pay for itself within five or six years, though for the first three years, 1997-1999, earnings per share would be diluted, but solidly accretive thereafter.
Worries that the stock transaction was too generous for MFS hit Worldcom stock, which was 3-3/4 or 15 percent lower at 22-5/8 in early afternoon. MFS soared 10 to 44-7/8, with both atop the active shares list on Nasdaq.
Ebbers said communicating the deal's advantages may take time. ""If that happens we will have a significantly increased stock price from where we are today,"" he said.  
UUNET, the internet service provider which MFS completed buying earlier this month, will have the biggest savings.
Now it can provide both local and long distance connections without having to pay fees on outside networks. These fees had previously swallowed up half of its revenues.     Most
importantly, the combined company MFS WorldCom can present a comprehensive business package without having to use the networks or pay the fees of others.
End-to-end service is the promise of the U.S. deregulation which became law early this year, but neither AT&amp;T Corp nor any regional Bell can yet achieve it either because of regulatory checklists or negotiating tussles.
""We think this gives us at least a two-year headstart over our competitors,"" Ebbers said.
By being first, Ebbers expects to reap wholesale business from the regional Bells and GTE Corp, companies which at a retail level are its competitors.
Ebbers said that any Bell which wanted to offer local telephone service outside its own region could simply resell the MFS WorldCom network, under the Bell's own brand name. -- New York Newsroom  212 859 1712

2013,"Sprint Corp showed a dynamic performance in all businesses in the third quarter of 1996, and better than MCI Communications Corp or AT&amp;T Corp will manage in long-distance telephone, analysts said.
But uncertainty surrounding the success of expensive new ventures, and continuing dilution of earnings from funding them, are a big and enduring question mark for investors.
""There is a two-sided story here: The businesses are growing very well, but there is all this dilution from new ventures,"" said analyst Richard Klugman of PaineWebber.  
Sprint third-quarter earnings per share were broadly in line with analysts' estimates at $0.72, down from $0.76 a year ago, weighed down by the cost of new ventures, a 24 percent increase in shares in issue and a two point tax rate rise.
But top line growth was outstanding, analysts said. Call volume carried soared by 21 percent from a year ago, while revenues increased 14.1 percent over the same period.
""Clearly this is going to be the strongest growth of the big three (AT&amp;T, MCI, Sprint) in long-distance volume and revenues,"" said Better Massick of brokers Bear Stearns.  
However, the shares managed only a restrained rise of 1/2 to 40-3/8 by 1300 EDT/1700 GMT Tuesday.
Two complex multi-billion dollar ventures, Sprint PCS and Global One, caused respectively four and six cents per share of earnings dilution in the third quarter, and more is seen.
Sprint PCS is a wireless Personal Communications Services (PCS) national network being built for tiny new mobile phones that have better battery life and building penetration than existing cellular services, and extra features like paging.  
Sprint owns 40 percent of Sprint PCS, Tele-Communications Inc owns 30 percent, and Comcast Corp and Cox Communications Inc each own 15 percent.
""The question mark over the company is PCS and its ability to execute the strategy,"" said Simon Flannery of J.P. Morgan.
PCS services are already operating in one metropolitan area, Washington-Baltimore, and Sprint expects to launch two more in November and to be in 15 to 20 by the year end.  
But as each new market opens, the amortization of the license cost -- Sprint paid a total of $2.1 billion for licenses -- plus marketing, network costs and subsidised handset costs also kick in.
Analysts estimate that Sprint could suffer $450 million to $650 million dilution from those costs in 1997. The more successful it is with PCS, the higher these costs will be.
""PCS will not breakeven for years,"" Klugman said. ""But Global One should breakeven sometime in the second half of 1997,"" he added.  
Global One is an international venture designed both to act as a carrier of services for other telecommunications companies, and a one-stop shop for multinational corporations.
It is half owned by Sprint, and a quarter each by France Telecom and soon-to-be privatised Deutsche Telekom.
The European companies also took a 20 percent stake in Sprint for $3.66 billion in January, which accounts for the extra shares in issue.
Sprint said that Global One is on course for annualised revenues of $1 billion a year by the end of 1996, but Flannery said it was harder to figure out the earnings position.
""The visibility of earnings at Global One is not very good yet,"" Flannery said. -- New York Newsroom 212 859 1712

The combined company, to be called MFS WorldCom, will provide ""a single source for a full range of local, long distance, Internet and international service over an advanced fiber optic network,"" Worldcom said.
The merged company will have current annualized revenue of about $5.4 billion, with more than 500,000 business customers throughout North America, Europe and Asia. It will have an end-to-end fiber optic network with 25,000 miles of fiber in service or under construction connecting all major metropolitan areas in the United States.
""We are creating the first company since the breakup of AT&amp;T to bundle together local and long distance services carried over an international end-to-end fiber network owned or controlled by a single company,"" said Bernard J. Ebbers, president and CEO of WorldCom.
The deregulation of the telecommunications industry early this year promises to bring end-to-end service, but neither AT&amp;T Corp. nor any regional Bell can yet achieve it because of regulatory checklists and negotiating tussles.
""We think this gives us at least a two-year headstart over our competitors,"" Ebbers said in an interview.
The merger comes only weeks after MFS' $2 billion purchase of UUNET Technologies Inc. was completed on Aug. 12. That merger created a single source for Internet, voice, data and video services over an international fiber optic grid. MFS' stock has risen 41 percent a year since it went public three years ago.
In the latest deal, which was unanimously approved by both companies' boards, each share of MFS common stock will be exchanged for 2.1 shares of WorldCom common stock.
""As of Friday's closing, the merger consideration for MFS stock is approximately $14 billion,"" the statement said.
MSF's stock leaped $10 to $44.875 on Nasdaq in late trading.
However, worries that the deal was too generous hit Worldcom's stock, which has soared an average of 57 percent a year over the last 10 years. It fell $3.75 to $22.625 on Nasdaq after the company said the merger would dilute earnings for three years.
Although the transaction was valued at $55.39 per WorldCom share based on Friday's closing price, the steep drop in WorldCom's stock brought the value down to $47 per share, traders said.
""Over time, I think the deal will be viewed very positively, but it will take time,"" one takeover trader said.
Omaha, Neb.-based MFS is a major provider of communications services for business and government. Its local networks in dozens of major U.S. cities enable it to outflank the regional Bells' lock on access to local business customers, giving it a strong bargaining position in the merger.
""He (Ebbers) had the only one sizable company to merge with whose stock we really wanted (to own),"" James Crowe, chief executive of MFS, told reporters.
Despite the substantial stock premium for MFS, savings would soon cover the cost of the deal, Ebbers said.
Jackson, Miss.-based WorldCom said it expects significant cost savings from reduced line and access costs. The deal will also eliminate duplication of capital spending programmes and position the combined company to take full advantage of the recent easing of telecommunications laws, it said.
Specifically, MFS no longer has to build a $500 million intercity network, because WorldCom already has one. WorldCom will not have to take a share in a $450 million transatlantic cable for its expanding international business because MFS is already a partner in one.
Ebbers said access charges that Worldcom pays to local telephone companies to reach their local customers would drop because MFS already has local lines to businesses in 45 U.S. cities, rising to 85 cities in two years.
UUNET, the internet service provider that MFS bought earlier this month, will have the biggest savings.
WorldCom said the companies hope to close the latest merger in four to eight months, subject to federal regulatory approval. Shareholders will vote on the deal at special meetings.
Worldcom said in a separate statement that it has adopted a shareholder rights plan to discourage a hostile takeover. It said move was not affected by the deal with MFS.

2033,"Worries about regulatory hurdles and a lengthy 12 months to completion took the edge off market euphoria over MCI Communications Corp's merger with British Telecommunications Corp, analysts said on Monday.
MCI shares were trading on Monday morning just 1/4 firmer at 30-1/2, well adrift of a theoretical value that oscillated around $39 per share, based on the price of BT American depositary shares.  
""The arbs are probably demanding between 15 and 20 percent on this deal because of the lengthy time to closing and the uncertainties of U.S. regulatory approval,"" said analyst Richard Klugman of PaineWebber.
The deal is an offer of 0.54 new American depositary shares in the new combined group, named Concert, for every MCI share. Each Concert ADS is equivalent to one BT American depositary share and $6 cash.  
Analysts noted a yawning gap between the value of the deal taken by using BT shares in London and the ADS shares, and a fuzzy debate about how much of the $5.60 BT special dividend should be deducted from the ADS price.
""It depends on what you use as the implied exchange rate,"" said analyst Julie Kennedy of Goldman Sachs. At Monday's one pound equals $1.64, the ADS shares look to be too far ahead.
In any case the final calculations will seesaw with changes in both BT's stock price and the exchange rate.  
Given the broader uncertainties, arbitragers didn't expect to push up the shares to the point where they would have to go over the details looking for the last few cents.
""MCI is trading where is should, in line with BT based on a nine to 12 month transaction, and figuring MCI holders not getting the special (BT) dividends,"" one arbitrager said.
Analysts say the market is not expecting much of the possible buyback of up to 10 percent of Concert shares, which could take place after the deal closes.
Klugman said that though a buyback spreads a given level of earnings over fewer shares, the cost of purchase show up in operating earnings as higher interest charges.
By how much earnings per share improves hinges on how much cheaper debt is than equity, analysts say.  -- New York Newsroom 212 859 1610

2037,"Third quarter results at both MCI Communications Corp and Sprint Corp will be restrained by the cost of new ventures, and in Sprint's case the issue of new shares will lower per share earnings.
But analysts say both have so far escaped the problems which have hit AT&amp;T Corp in the consumer long distance market, and which led to AT&amp;T's profit warning in September.
""MCI will have increased earnings, but will continue the second quarter trend of slower long distance volume growth,"" Massick said Bette Massick of brokerage Bear Stearns.  
Sprint's earnings per share are expected to be lower than a year ago because of investment in the international Global One venture and in Personal Communications Services.
Sprint's shares in issue will rise to about 435 million, from 351 million a year ago, because of stock issued to partners Deutsche Telekom  DTK.CN and French Telecom.
MCI's heavy investment in media, Internet and satellite services with News Corp Ltd is not expected to break even for several years.
""The dilutive effects of the MCI ventures will increase year over year,"" Massick said.  
AT&amp;T said on September 24 that earnings per share could be as much as 10 percent below analysts' forecasts of $0.92 per share for the third quarter.  If this fear were realized, it would report earnings of $0.83, 13.5 percent below the $0.96 of a year earlier.
Analysts say AT&amp;T's problems were an expensive and flawed consumer market strategy of trying to win customers by offering them $100 checks and the competitive effect of small, fast-growing resellers and ""dial around"" services.  
Resellers include companies like Excel Communications Inc, which have produced 50 percent-plus annual revenue growth by using independent sales representatives to sell to friends, family and associates.
Dial around is so named because customers use a 1-800 number to access a rival service advertising cut price rates for long distance or international calling, without switching their long distance provider.
The long distance giants do not lose the customer, but notice a fall in average billable revenue.  
MCI expects higher customer turnover in consumer markets because of increased competition. But neither it nor Sprint depends as heavily on the consumer market as AT&amp;T does.
Merrill Lynch analyst Dan Reingold said in a research report that demand demand for Sprint's services is robust.
""Our forecast minute (of use) growth rate of 9.1 percent should be almost double the industry average...indicating that Sprint continues to take market share,"" Reingold said.
By contrast he expected AT&amp;T minutes of use to grow by 6.2 percent from a year ago, and revenue on this to rise just 1.5 percent.
This growth gap of 4.7 percentage points would exceed the 3.4 percent of the second quarter, he said.
Analysts say Sprint and MCI are not immune to the threat from dial around and resellers, but in any case the threat will be contained in the next two or three years.
""I think the idea of packages or bundles of services will be very much a threat to the small dial around competition because they won't be able to compete up and down the product chain,"" said Guy Woodlief of brokers Dean Witter Reynolds.  
AT&amp;T's adoption of a flat rate 15 cent long distance charge should help it regain market share, especially against Sprint, which charges a flat 25 cents during the day.
Such is the danger is adopting a clear pricing policy -- when more than one major competitor does it comparisons become easy and can lead to a downward spiral in calling charges.
""Given AT&amp;T's brand position in the market place, it is going to remain a formidable competitor,"" said Woodlief. Company   (all in dollars)    Q3 est   yr ago  results date

2040,"British Telecom and MCI Communications on Sunday announced a $20 billion merger, using the largest cross-border takeover deal in history to spawn a global telecommunications powerhouse.
The merged company, to be called Concert Plc, creates the world's second-largest telecommunications group, based on market capitalisation, behind Japan's NTT Corp.
Valued at $54 billion based on Friday's closing stock prices, Concert is neck-and-neck with U.S. long-distance leader AT&amp;T Corp., which is MCI's arch-rival in the super-competitive U.S. market.
For customers, the deal promises better service and lower international calling charges, while for businesses it means a company that can support them wherever they are. For for shareholders, it means faster earnings growth, analysts said.
""This is not a pebble we're throwing onto a quiet pool. It is a big rock, and it's going to make a big splash,"" Sir Iain Vallance, chairman of British Telecommunications Plc, told a news conference in New York.
The deal values all of Washington,D.C.-based MCI at a total $25.2 billion. But as British Telecom already owns 20 percent, it will issue Concert stock and cash worth $20.1 billion for the 80 percent it does not own. Holders of this MCI stake will thus control 33 percent of the stock in the combined company.
Because the companies have already worked together for three years, they expect the merged company to function well.
""Mergers don't always work, but this one will,"" Vallance added.
AT&amp;T, which would be the hardest hit by a financially muscular enlarged rival, said it was confident any MCI/British Telecom deal would receive proper scrutiny by the U.S. government and called on both U.S. and European regulators to condition approval of the deal on a further freeing of competition in British Telecom's home market.
Already strong in long distance, MCI hopes to use BT's service and back-up expertise, plus plenty of cash, to help take a big chunk of the $100 billion a year U.S. local calling market from the regional Bells.
That market is expected to gradually open to competition following legislation earlier this year. Since 1984 it had been the monopoly of the seven regional Bells.
MCI Chief Executive Bert Roberts said he was confident the combination with British Telecom would win the approval of federal regulators, noting that ""the U.K. is the most competitive telecommunications market in the world.""
He added that the deal would result in lower expenditures for both companies because ""costs will be reduced by building networks once, not twice."" The companies expect to save $1.5 billion in costs over five years.
Employees, usually tense during mergers, can relax.
""Minimal job cuts, that is the joy of this. MCI will operate in the Americas, and BT will operate in the U.K and the rest of the world,"" Vallance told Reuters.
Concert Plc would be one of the world's largest telecommunications companies, with 43 million business and residential customers in 70 countries.
""The complementary strengths and skills of BT and MCI will enable Concert to take full advantage of the great opportunities provided by the forthcoming liberalisation of the telecommunications market in the U.S. and Europe,"" said Vallance.
Under the terms of the agreement, which has yet to be approved by regulatory authorities on either side of the Atlantic, MCI shareholders would receive 0.54 new American Depositary Shares in the new combined group for every MCI share. Each Concert ADS is equivalent to one British Telecom American Depositary Share and $6 cash.
British Telecom's ADSs closed at $55.50 in New York on Friday, giving a value of $30 per MCI share, plus $6 in cash per share before the effect of a buyback by British Telecom that is part of the deal, MCI Chief Financial Officer Doug Maine told Reuters.
British Telecom said Concert will buy back up to 10 percent of its shares after the deal closes. The maximum buyback would increase the value of the deal to MCI shareholders to $39.60 per MCI share. MCI's stock closed Friday at $30.25 on Nasdaq.
The new company, incorporated in Britain, would have headquarters in London and Washington and operate under the British Telecom and MCI brand names.
British Telecom has been looking for a major acquisition since its proposed merger with British rival Cable and Wireless failed in May. It had been keen to forge that deal because it would have given it access to the lucrative Asian telecoms market -- the world's fastest-growing market.
Analysts now expect British Telecom and MCI to start making overtures to major Asian players such as Japan's giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.
But while seeking an Asian partner, MCI is putting another one on a backburner.
MCI is to cut its stake in a U.S. satellite venture with Australian media tycoon Rupert Murdoch to 20 percent from 50 percent, and will not increase its stake in Murdoch's News Corp as originally expected.
""It is unlikely you will see us increasing our investment (in News Corp),"" Roberts told Reuters.
MCI paid $1.35 billion for a stake of just under 9 percent, and could increase it to 13 percent with another $1 billion investment.
Roberts added that if U.S. regulatory permission could be obtained, he may even sell the $700 million license that goes with the U.S. direct-to-home broadcast satellite to Murdoch.

2050,"America Online Inc unveiled a broad strategy to transform the online service provider into a mass media company in a move that further renders Internet access services a commodity business.
Earlier Tuesday, the world's leading online service introduced a flat-rate Internet pricing option as a part of a comprehensive restructuring plan, ending years of resistance to competing directly with Internet access providers on price.  
In addition, AOL said it hired Robert Pittman, a prominent media executive, to head its flagship online service, and put forth measures aimed at shoring up its image with investors.
AOL had said it planned to take $460 million in charges spread over the recently ended September quarter and the upcoming December period, mainly to cover its switch to a more conservative method of accounting for marketing costs.
The stock see-sawed as investors digested whether the near-term profits impact was compensated for by the prospect AOL would become a stable, but growing, mass media enterprise.
AOL shares had risen 1 to 25-5/8 in late trading Tuesday.  
Gary Arlen, an online industry analyst, said ""the market is responding to the financial announcements and not to the promise of all these other plans, including what Pittman brings to the company.""
Arlen added that the restructuring plan demonstrates that AOL ""is a dynamic company that can respond to challenges decisively.
In an interview, AOL chairman Steve Case said Pittman -- the broadcast executive who created MTV and made it the first profitble cable TV company -- was hired to help lead AOL into a new era of growth by addressing the mass media market.  
While Case expects AOL to pass the 10 million mark in subscriptions late in calender year 1997, ""The focus is not on getting to 10 million, but getting out to tens of millions and that's what (Pittman) is focused on,"" he said of the new divsion head.
Pittman, who also took part in the phone interview, said that with TV-sized audiences on the horizon, AOL planned to accelerate its emphasis on advertising, online merchandising and sources of revenue other than subscriber fees.
""The main point is that we are really shifting the business model toward these new sources of revenues,"" he said.  
Analysts said AOL's thrust into the Internet access business will have reprucussions for rival online companies, Internet access providers and even the firms that create special entertainment and other programming for the Internet.
Arlen said the first casualty of AOL's plans to offer seemless access to the Internet will be its own GNN Internet service, which AOL told analysts it plans to discontinue.
At a new rate of $19.95, AOL puts itself in the same pricing league as ""pure"" Internet access providers, such as Netcom On-Line Communications Inc and Earthlink Network Inc, which offer little or no proprietary content.  
""What happens is that access becomes a commodity service,"" said Arlen, who heads Arlen Communications Inc in Bethesda, Md. ""AOL has now defined the $20 a month Internet access rate as a commodity,"" he said.
However, in a phone interview, David Garrison, Netcom's chief executive said he expects to feel little direct impact from the AOL move, since Netcom is mainly focused on serving and ""adding value"" for business customers.
Netcom, with 562,000 paying subscribers as of September 30, is the largest independent provider of Internet access. More than 98 percent of Netcom's customers already pay $19.95.  
""The difference is that our product is not aimed at the consumer, the entertainment sector if you will,"" he said in contrasting AOL's core market with Netcom's business focus.
Reflecting the differing demand of his base of small and medium-sized business customers, Garrison claimed that Netcom turnover rates have remained relatively low and stable over the last seven quarters -- in striking contrast to AOL.
Arlen noted that America Online also discussed ambitious plans to develop an increasing amount of programming content for the Internet in its newly created AOL Studio division, led by long-time executive Ted Leonsis.  
In effect, AOL is commodifying the programming content on the Web, much in the way the big Hollywood movie studios have dominated film and broadcast production, Arlen said.
""AOL is becoming a one-stop source for Internet access, programming content and other services,"" Arlen said. ""I expect that AOL's offerings will be totally satisfactory to the millions of users who are newbies to the Internet and a large number of heavy users who are fed up with shopping for deals.""
Abhishek Gami, an analyst at Nesbitt Burns Securities, added that, ""Now there will be less confusion both for investors and for consumers as well.""

2051,"Intel Corp shares slid another four points on Friday, continuing a three-day retreat triggered by smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc's statement that its turnaround plan is on track.
But analysts and money managers were unruffled by what they said was profit-taking in Intel and a temporary shift among some momentum investors to AMD and away from Intel.
Intel stock has lost about six percent of its value since Wednesday, when Advanced Micro said it was sampling its Pentium-like K6 chip, which its expect to ship in early 1997.  
Intel closed at 115-7/8, down 4, on volume of 15 million shares, marking it as the most active Nasdaq stock. Intel, a key component in the Nasdaq Composite index, has acted as a drag on the market even as the NYSE has hit new record highs.
The Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 1261.81, off 8.55.
Edwin Turney, a Silicon Valley-based technology money manager who runs the Panagea fund, agreed, saying: ""You have a lot of profit-taking and then you have got the momentum players who have had a hell of a run in the last 6 months.
""So now they are looking at the secondary players,"" Turney said, referring specifically to Advanced Micro.  
""AMD has been a catalyst for other people to take profit,"" agreed Merrill Lynch semiconductor analyst Thomas Kurlak.
""There is really nothing specifically to explain (Intel's recent decline). It's just another wiggle in the chart.""
Soundview President James Townsend agreed AMD's announcement may have provided an excuse for some investors to temporarily shift out of Intel.
""With a stock that has been this incredibly successful, it may be enough to take some profits off the table,"" Townsend said. He was referring to Intel's impressive 50 point rise to new record levels since mid-summer.  
AMD stock has languished in recent years after repeated failures to match Intel's Pentium technology. However, since Wednesday, the stock has gained more than 20 percent. It closed at 25-1/8, up 1/2 point on the day on Friday.
Analysts said AMD's new K6 chips are not compatible with Intel latest Pentium Pro chips, but the chip could do a healthy business as a simple Pentium alternative.
""There's clearly room enough for both companies to do well,"" said C.B. Lee, an analyst at Hancock Institutional Partners, who follows both Intel and AMD.  
""Clearly, AMD has had some impact in the minds of some investors,"" Lee said of Intel's declines in recent days, but added: ""In my mind AMD is not a threat.""
Analysts expect Intel to produce 20 million Pentium microprocessors in the current quarter, while AMD will build only a tiny fraction of that number -- and less powerful processers at that.
Like most chip sector securities analysts, Kurlak maintains a strong buy on Intel and a neutral rating on AMD.
Lee said he also remains neutral on AMD, ""but its back in my good graces"" with its plans to introduce the K6 chip.
In the last week, Prudential Securities analyst Mark Edelstone was alone among Wall Street analysts in upgrading AMD to a buy from a hold in response to the K6 announcement.

2061,"Computer distribution powerhouse Ingram Micro Inc. is set to hold its widely anticipated initial public offering on Wall Street Thursday despite some last-minute delays, including management changes.
""We haven't seen anything comparable in the technology sector with its kind of name this year,"" said Manish Shah, editor and publisher of the IPO Maven, of the new issue.
Anticipating heavy demand, the estimated price on Ingram's 20 million share offering was boosted to $17 to $19 a share Wednesday from $14 to $16, said underwriter Morgan Stanley.  
As the world's leading distributor of computer hardware, software and networking equipment to corporate resellers and computer retailers, Santa Ana, Calif.-based Ingram is a veritable steam-engine of computer industry growth.
There are really only three world-class distributors of computer products: Ingram, with revenues expected to hit roughly $10 billion this year, Merisel Inc. with $6 billion and Tech Data Corp. at $4 billion.  
That size advantage is crucial said Seymour Merrin, a leading industry analyst, who heads Merrin Information Services Inc. in Palo Alto, Calif. ""Market share isn't just an important factor,"" Merrin said. ""It's the only factor.""
Ingram's suppliers read like a Who's Who of the leading computer brands -- names like IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Cisco, Apple, Novell and U.S. Robotics. And like many of those names, Ingram is seen as the undisputed leader in its own industry.
Its main customers are not end-users of technology products, but the middlemen of distribution -- corporate resellers, systems intergrators and computer retailers.  
""Ingram's got it all: distribution power, brand quality and customer or franchise loyalty,"" Shah said.
Underlying excitement about the new stock is a belief that Ingram is positioned to benefit directly from a multi-year computer buying boom expected to take hold later this year or early in 1997 and last for anywhere from two to four years.
Companies are preparing to upgrade to faster Intel Pentium PCs running Microsoft Windows NT and buy a host of related products made passible by the more powerful machines.  
In one important respect, however, Ingram should not be classified with other top technology names famous for their explosive earnings growth and spiraling stock prices.
Ingram competes in a brutal low-margin business that has more in common with supermarkets or trucking than computers -- its profit margins have in fact declined to 6.8 percent in the first half of 1996 from 8.1 percent in 1993.
The company's path to Wall Street has not been without its detours and mishaps.  
An anticipated public offering was temporarily derailed earlier in the year when Linwood ""Chip"" Lacy -- the engineer credited with driving Ingram Micro's growth over the years -- resigned as chairman and chief executive.
Ingram located a prominent replacement in Jerre Stead, the former head of mainframe software maker Legent Corp. until its 1995 acqusition by Computer Associates International Inc. It named Michael Grainger chief finacial officer two weeks ago.
But any Ingram doubters will remain on the sidelines Thursday.  
""It is definitely one of the best offerings of the year. There is great demand,"" said Shah for shares of the stock. ""I think it will remain strong and by the end of year, it could be a $30 stock,"" he added.  
In an industry known for its love of jargon, computer business insiders speak with a mix of reverential awe about ""the Channel"" - short for distribution channel and the delivery mechanism that has make-or-break control over the future of any computer product.
Ingram is to ""the Channel"" what Microsoft is to software, Intel is to microprocessors and Cisco is to networking.

2065,"Iomega Corp's plans to apply its computer storage technology to handheld consumer electronics may fundamentally lower the cost of saving and transfering data to such devices.
The reusable data storage system, to be known as ""n-hand,"" could be used in digital cameras, computer game devices, cellular phones and handheld personal computers known as digital assistants.  
In cameras, for example, the technology could function as a removable ""digital film"" that would replace existing chemical photographic film.
""Our n-hand technology ... has the potential to change the way consumers use portable electronic devices,"" said Kim Edwards, president and chief executive of the Roy, Utah-based company, in a statement.
""We are bringing personal computer-like storage to portable devices,"" added George Meyer, Iomega's director of marketing for new business, in a phone interview.  
The n-hand disks are expected to be priced at less than $10 for a 20-megabyte disk, and could be available by the second half of 1997. Iomega said the n-hand disks are about half the size of a business card.
Several industry analysts said they believe Iomega's technology could help propel digital cameras into the consumer mainstream within a matter of years, by freeing users from the fixed capacity of existing flash memory storage and by substantially reducing the overall cost of such cameras.  
A digital camera could store from 50 to 80 images on a single $10 n-hand disk, Iomega said, depending on image resolution. Consumers now pay hundreds of dollars for a flash memory card capable of holding the same number of images, it noted.
Jim Porter, a data storage analyst with market research firm Disk/Trend Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., said the Iomega technology could cut the cost of storing photographs by a factor of 20 times.
A Kodak digital camera now costing $499 could be priced as low as $300 within a matter of years, he said, reflecting the elimination of more costly digital storage methods.  
Iomega's plans pose a theat to makers of flash memory chips that are used to store digital information in such small electronic devices currently. Leading makers include Sandisk Corp, Intel Corp and Toshiba Corp.
In addition, the Iomega system could help accelerate the current digital transformation of the camera industry, leading to a decline in revenues that cameramakers receive from conventional silver-halide-based photo film and equipment.
""With 'n-hand' you have a digital camera that you can treat like a regular camera,"" Meyer said, referring to the replaceable nature of the Iomega high-density floppy disk system.
""This technology can make digital cameras much more competitive with regular ones,"" he said.
Besides lacking a low-cost removable storage medium, digital cameras offer inferior picture quality but image resolution is improving rapidly, analysts said. This could lead to explosive growth of the new cameras in coming years.
Shares of the company closed up $1.375 to $25.375 on Thursday in active trading on the Nasdaq. On Friday, Iomega's stock will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

2066,"Coupon clipping is coming to cyberspace.
SaveSmart Inc., a start-up company based in Mountain View, Calif., plans to unveil on Monday a credit card-based scheme to allow computer users to browse for and take advantage of bargains offered by a wide range of local, regional and national merchants.
Consumers will be able to qualify for automated discounts on groceries, dining out, movies, clothing, furniture and auto repairs, among other items.
The company said that using its special credit card eliminates the inconvenience and inefficency of paper-based promotional coupons delivered in newspapers or by direct mail. Industry figures show that only about 2 percent of paper coupons are actually redeemed.
SaveSmart said the service dramatically enhances sales promotions by making it easier for consumers to find and use them, while making them cost-effective for merchants to offer.
""We are driving physical traffic into the merchants' stores,"" said Bernard David, SaveSmart's executive vice president of business development.
Advertising analysts said the new interactive promotion service could play a key role in transforming the industry, which generates about $120 billion a year, according to the media research firm of Veronis, Suhler and Associates.
""All Web promotions need to be attractive in the real world, not just the virtual world of cyberspace,"" said Mary Doyle, a Web marketing analyst for IDC/Link Resources.
What differentiates SaveSmart from thousands of other Internet-based commerce efforts is the linkage the service makes between computer users and actual businesses, she said.
The company's Web site -- www.savesmart.com -- offers an online database of merchant promotions personalized to fit the individual's interests.
Consumers can browse through promotional offerings and when they find a promotion they want, ""select"" it and reserve it. They can then redeem the promotion by presenting the SaveSmart card at a merchant's store at the time of purchase.
SaveSmart targets what it describes as ""neighborhood trading areas"" of roughly 100,000 people.
The service will be launched Monday in the area around Palo Alto, Calif., with service expanding to include the entire San Francisco Bay Area by the end of the year.
In 1997, the company plans to roll the system out in 10 additional U.S. cities where Internet use is most heavily concentrated, including Boston, New York, Washington D.C./Baltimore and Orange County, just south of Los Angeles.
The company said it plans a coordinated direct marketing campaign in each city where the service is introduced to sign up individual card members using mail and newspaper ads.
In addition, SaveSmart said it has been successful in promoting the card as an employee benefit offered by large computer companies.
""Our target is to have tens of thousands of SaveSmart members within each neighbourhood trading area,"" David said, adding that he expected to meet that goal in SaveSmart's first service areas ""within a couple of months, to be quite frank.""
To date, SaveSmart said it has signed up 400 merchants, representing a cross-section of locally available goods and services. McDonald's, Domino's Pizza and Subway Sandwiches are participating. In addition, it has agreed to a deal with at least one major movie studio, which it declined to name.
While the system would appear to be a threat to traditional promotional outlets like direct mail marketers and newspaper publishers, SaveSmart said it is working with one leading U.S. household direct marketer and that there is nothing to preclude it from linking up with news publishers.
David said SaveSmart would also make a logical fit with local telephone companies, but declined to say whether the company had reached any such agreements.
The company, which has about 30 employees,. was founded by executives from VeriFone Inc. and other Silicon Valley computer firms. VeriFone is a leading global supplier of merchant credit card transaction terminals.
SaveSmart provides special VeriFone-built terminals to merchants using its credit-card system.
Company officials said SaveSmart is designed to leave open the possibility that the system could be adopted by a major credit card company, so that consumers could use their normal credit card to conduct SaveSmart transactions.
The company has held talks with major credit card companies, but there are no deals to announce, officials said.
SaveSmart has not disclosed its financial backers. Industry consultants familiar with the company said they include Bill Melton, founder of VeriFone, and also CyberCash Inc., an Internet commerce company.
Other backers include members of Germany's Quandt family, who are ranked among the world's richest families, they said.

2080,"America Online Inc's new flat rate pricing plan and moves to meet spiraling subscriber demand suggest AOL is securely on course for becoming a major media player comparable to broadcast or cable TV networks.
But analysts caution that underlying this success looms a real threat that the online network's capacity to serve its more than seven million subscribers could soon be overwhelmed.
They warn that the additional demand on AOL's network generated by the company's offer of unlimited usage for $19.95 per month imperil its near-term capacity to handle demand.  
If only a small fraction of AOL's millions of members were to take up the company's offer of unlimited access and remain connected to the service for long periods of the day, the service would quickly grind to a halt, detractors say.
Clearly, investors are betting the company can surmount such challenges, as AOL has done repeatedly in mushrooming sevenfold from under one million users three years ago.
In recent weeks, the stock's momentum has revived, doubling from a year-low of 22 to reach 44 earlier Tuesday. An afternoon sell-off caused the stock to fall back to 37-1/2.  
""The market appears to have taken a very bullish view of the new pricing scheme,"" said Arthur Newman, an analyst with brokerage firm Gerard Klauer of the stock's recent run-up.
""But you have to balance this with the realization that the more time users spend online, the higher the cost of adding capacity"" requiring new equipment investments, he said.
""All of a sudden its free candy at the candy store,"" Newman said of the paradoxical downside of a sudden explosion in demand. Although a long-time follower of AOL, the analyst currently maintains no stock recommendation on the stock.  
To be fair, AOL officials have warned repeatedly that they expect the next two quarters to be transitional, both operationally and financially, as the company shifts to a new business model that derives revenues from advertising and commercial transactions instead of mainly subscriber fees.
But Abishek Gami, an analyst with Nesbitt Burns Securities, believes AOL has proven its capacity to weather the pressures of the explosively growing online medium. In particular, AOL has measures in place to limit excessive connection times by users who now have little incentive to disconnect and free up pressure network time for others.  
""Will this demand on its network be enough to destroy the company? I think not. What the company will do is build-out to meet demand and stage a comeback,"" said Gami, who maintains a strong buy rating on AOL stock.
Gary Arlen, a veteran online industry analyst at Arlen Communications Inc in Bethesda, Md, agreed.
""Anyone who is writing this company's obituary is going to be disappointed,"" he said.
Monday, AOL said it was undertaking a major expansion of its online network and planned to spend $250 million by next June to double its network capacity and improve service.  
Gami estimated the company has about 200,000 modems now available to handle incoming customer calls for its online service and that this number will rise to about 400,000 by next June, the end of its fiscal year.
In its Monday announcement, the world's largest online service provider said it was upgrading its network to meet the surge in demand generated by its new pricing and recent marketing initiatives.
As of Sunday, AOL began offering the new flat-rate pricing plan, one of several pricing options available to customers.  
An America Online spokesman said that, despite heavy usage over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, there were no serious problems with its online network.
The Dulles, Va.-based company said that, since July 1, it has added tens of thousands of new modems to AOLnet, which it said was the world's largest dial-in network. The expansion is to accelerate through the spring with tens of thousands of new modems being installed monthly.
Analysts said that, with more new users expected, AOL needs to upgrade its network, especially after its nearly 19 hour outage on August 7, which happened during regular maintenance caused by a software glitch and angered many users.
Already this quarter, AOL's subscriber growth is on the rebound and, in October, the company added 275,000 new members. In the summer, AOL was hurt by a seasonal slowdown in subscriber growth, a phenomenon common to all online services.
Still, in its latest quarterly SEC filing, AOL said profit margins will be hurt in the near-term and it is only likely to break into profitability again in the June 1997 quarter.

2087,"Computer Associates International Inc. issued its quarterly financial results, soundly beating Wall Street's consensus forecast.
But the stock fell sharply Wednesday morning after company executives told securities analysts they planned to acclerate investments in its personal computer-based corporate software products and de-emphasise mainframe software sales.
Analysts also said some investors were spooked by a slowdown in the company's international sales, which fell about 5 percent in the latest quarter ended in September compared to a year ago.
Computer Associates shares lost more than than $4 in early trading but regained some ground later in the day after several analysts reaffirmed ""buy"" ratings on the stock and raised their future earnings projections on the company.
The stock closed at $62.875, down $2.75 on the day, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
In a phone interview, Computer Associates President Sanjay Kumar confirmed the company planned to increase its investments in its PC-related mid-range software business.
""In reality, (mid-range software) is the right place to be,"" Kumar said of the company's planned shift in emphasis. ""It is the high-growth business.""
The executive said mid-range software amounted to about 31 percent of overall revenue in the latest quarter and was the fastest-growing portion of its business, with sales rising 56 percent above last year's September quarter, he said.
""What we neeed to do is engineer the business to move in that direction,"" Kumar said.
But mainframe software continues to account for more than twice the revenues of mid-range products, or 63 percent of the latest quarter's total reveneues of $990 million.
Mainframe sales rose 10 percent compared to the year-ago quarter, a rate Kumar said he expected would continue.
The remaining 6 percent of revenues derived from its small consumer accounting software and systems integration business.
Computer Associates has long been the world's leading supplier of mainframe software, but in recent years has sought to extend this dominance throughout corporate organisations by developing software used to manage personal computers.
This shift in focus to the smaller, albeit faster-growing part of its business prompted fears among some investors that Computer Assocites was entering a complicated transition.
""In general, you have to be concerned when a company says that it is going to be de-emphasising a part of its business that amounts to 60 percent of (its) revenues,"" said UBS Securities analyst Joe Farley.
But Farley discounted such concerns, saying the company's move came as no surprise to long-time observers of the business software maker. He embraced the choice to accelerate the company's commitment to the newer, higher-growth business.
""Their actions have already indicated that they are moving that way,"" Farley said of Computer Associates' increasing shift to PC-based mid-range products. ""Their words are following their actions,"" he said.
Kumar said the company contemplated a ""smooth transition"" over the next two years.
Mid-range sales will ""cross the threshold in fiscal 1998 probably"" and become the dominant source of revenue, he said.
In the interview, Kumar also said he expected the company to take a charge ""in the $500 million range"" related to a writedown of assets in its planned acquisition of Cheyenne Software Inc. during the current quarter ending in December.
The company began a $30.50 per share cash tender offer last Friday for Cheyenne.
The company expects the total cost of the Cheyenne acquisition to come to $1.2 billion, which it plans to fund through a combination of cash reserves and existing credit.

2089,"Semiconductor stocks, Wall Street's whipping boys for the past year, are headed toward becoming prized performers amid signs that double-digit growth is returning to the once hot sector, analysts said.
North American sales and bookings data for September due out on Tuesday afternoon are expected to confirm that the industry has reached a cyclical bottom and is poised to see a rebound in profits -- perhaps as early as the fourth quarter.
""They should definitely reaccelerate from here,"" said Montgomery analyst John Joseph of chip sales.

2093,"Shares of leading U.S. technology companies, already trading near all-time highs, languished on Tuesday as quarterly earnings raised concern that growth would be strong enough to push them to new peaks.
Intead, the sector was raked by profit-taking after a strong run-up in stock prices earlier in the fall season.
Several analysts and traders expressed concern over the lagging performance of top issues such as Microsoft Corp and International Business Machines Corp, which have taken hits even after healthy earnings reports.  
Microsoft was down 2-3/8 at 131-1/2 Tuesday, despite third quarter earnings that beat expectations by a nickel a share.
IBM slid 1-1/2 at 128-1/2, the day after it reported quarterly earnings two cents above the Wall Street consensus.
Intel Corp was trading 2-5/16 points lower Tuesday at 105-7/16, continuing a retreat from the record level of 114-1/4 it hit after its earnings release last week.
""Some companies are doing better (earnings-wise) and stocks are trading down,"" said one trader. ""Not that there's anything we have seen in the quality of earnings or the outlooks coming from a lot of major companies,"" he said.  
But other analysts argued that the lack of follow-through on recent share gains showed appropriate concern over valuations on the stocks, which had enjoyed a healthy rebound after the beating they took in early summer.
""They had a big run and they basically delivered what they are supposed to deliver,"" said James Cramer, president of trading firm Cramer &amp; Co.
IBM stock, for example, had been trading at record highs for the year recently. It reached above 135 at one point on Monday, a record intraday level for the past several years.  
""These stocks have come very far in a short amount of time,"" said Phil Orlando, market strategist for Value Line Asset Management of the sector's lagging share prices.
""We have just got earnings out of the way and now we are going to take some profits,"" he said of the market's reaction.
Other analysts noted how several once high-flying computer stocks have yielded disappointments this earnings season.
Silicon Graphics Inc shares suffered a pounding last week after it reported a net loss. The stock was down 1/4 of a point on Tuesday afternoon at 19-7/8, a new year-low.  
Earlier on Tuesday, Digital Equipment Corp reported a loss in its latest quarter of $0.48, well below the estimated loss of $0.14 per share analysts had been expecting. Digital was trading at a new year low of 29-1/8, off 5-1/4.
Sun Microsystems Inc was down 2-13/16 at 57-1/2 on Tuesday, continuing a decline seen since it disappointed investors last week by failing to deliver the strong upside earnings surprise now demanded of such high-growth companies.
Prior to Sun's report, the stock had reached above 70, or 30 percent above its level in the first week of September.  
A few analysts speculated that the lack of follow-through as expressed in share price gains may be tied to a retincence by technology executives to offer guidance on the future and thereby offer fresh reasons to propel these stocks forward.
Last week, officials at industry bellwether Intel refused to offer their typical outlook on industry trends, citing fears of shareholder lawsuits that might result if a California ballot proposal were to pass in November.
But others heaped scorn on the idea that possible passage of state initiative Proposition 211 was in any way depressing the stocks.  
""Proposition 211 is irrelevant to the market activity we are seeing,"" said John Kinnucan, a technology stock portfolio manage with Strome, Susskind Investment Management LP in Santa Monica, Calif.
""The reason is that people are looking at the quarterly financial results and the share price valuations and they see a mismatch,"" he said.
Kinnucan said it was reasonable to question the valuations of even a premier name like Microsoft, shares of which he noted have appreciated more than 1000 since late 1992.
""What would be of concern would be if people weren't asking questions about the valuations of these stocks,"" he said.

2094,"Intel Corp. stock surged Tuesday, lifted by a quarterly earnings report that substantially outpaced Wall Street expectations and confirmed its status among analysts as the shooting star of technology stocks.
The earnings report released Monday spurred gains in the stocks of personal computer makers who build machines based on Intel microprocessors but it did little to buoy other chip makers.
""The Intel report was clearly a positive for the whole PC industry,"" said veteran semiconductor analyst Dan Klesken of Robertson Stephens &amp; Co.
""It is an endorsement of our view that we are in for a strong upgrade cycle for the second half of the year,"" said Klesken.
Still, analysts said Intel stock gains were restrained by uncertainties over whether the third quarter's sharp rise in orders may have come at the expense of the fourth quarter.
The concern was magnified by Intel's decision to at least temporarily halt the practice of forecasting its business prospects.
Intel stock rose $3.50 to $111.125 Tuesday on Nasdaq in a volatile day of trading in which just under 20 million Intel shares changed hands. Intel's gains sparked the technology-heavy Nasdaq index to 1,258.10, up 1.74, its second consecutive record closing high.
On Monday Intel reported third-quarter profits of $1.3 billion, up from $931 million in 1995's third quarter. Wall Street had predicted profits of $1.1 billion.
Brokers responded to the results with a wave of higher earnings projections for Intel for 1996 and 1997.
Personal computer makers who rely on Intel micrprocessors also saw significant gains, as investors viewed Intel's order surge as confirmation of strong demand for the machines themselves.
Compaq Computer Corp. gained $2 to close at $74.75 in consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange, a day ahead of its own earnings report, due Wednesday.
Dell Computer Corp. rose $3.50 to $88.375 and Gateway 2000 Inc. climbed $3.375 to $56.75, both on Nasdaq.
But Intel's swelling fortunes were seen as having only limited effect on other semiconductor suppliers.
Montgomery Securities analyst Clark Westmont said the main beneficiaries were a handful of custom PC chip makers who sell graphics controllers and other PC-related devices.
Every Intel processor that goes into a PC is accompanied by serveral such ancillary chips.
""Intel is the locomotive who drags along all the other guys in this food chain,"" Westmont said. ""As a result, these other guys are enjoying higher recognition today.""
He pointed in particular to PC graphics component supplier Chips and Technologies Inc. stock, which jumped $4.875 to $19.75, or roughly 25 percent, after it released its own strong quarterly earnings report.

2097,"Shiva Corp. stock lost almost half its value Wednesday after the data communications equipment maker stunned Wall Street by revealing that fourth-quarter earnings were likely to be no more than a third of expectations.
The company's stock plunged $15.625, or 45 percent, to $19.25 on Nasdaq after it said late on Tuesday it expected earnings for the fourth quarter of 1996 to be between 5 cents and 7 cents a share.
That would be sharply below consensus estimates of 21 cents a share, according to First Call, which tracks analysts' estimates. Twenty-four million shares exchanged hands, making it the day's most actively traded issue.
Securities analysts said the earnings shortfall triggered the massive sell-off, but that the decline was accelerated by plans by company officials to make changes in Shiva's business strategy that analysts said could imperil earnings further.
""I think the drop was to a large extent a reaction in the stock to the warning of lower earnings,"" said Smith Barney analyst Therese Murphy. ""But I think when people sit back they are also going to be concerned about the change in strategy.""
In a brief statement released after the markets closed on Tuesday, the Bedford, Mass.-based company said the shortfall was based on preliminary calculations.
Chief Financial Officer Cynthia Deysher said in a phone interview on Tuesday that the shortfall was mainly due to weakness in domestic sales and a decision by International Business Machines Corp. to delay an order during the quarter.
""We didn't receive the Q4 (order) from IBM,"" Deysher said. IBM is a key reseller of Shiva's networking products. She also said the company did not ship as much product as it expected in the quarter.
The Shiva official said the company would take steps to address the shortfall, including reorganizing its sales force.
Deysher said Shiva had renegotiated terms of its strategic alliance with Canada's Northern Telecom Ltd., a move she said is likely to cause revenues to decline but profit margins to rise, ensuring it can still meet its earnings goals.
Deysher said NorTel will assume the costs of manufacturing products resulting from the alliance and cover a larger share of the partnership's research and development costs.
Shiva's switching equipment is one piece of a larger Northern Telecom communications system that allows remote callers such as telecommuters or traveling sales staff to dial into central office computers.
""We felt it would be more profitable because we are moving to a royalty arrangement"" with Nortel, Deysher said. Shiva will be paid a percentage of sales instead of for each product it builds, as called for under the prior terms of the alliance.
Before its fall from grace, many Wall Street analysts classified Shiva as one of the fast-growing companies best-positioned to participate in the massive demand for network equipment used to build the Internet's infrastructure.
While executives said they remained confident Shiva could make up the lost ground in future quarters and still meet the Wall Street consensus expectation of $1.06 per share for fiscal 1998, Wall Street analysts refused to buy the argument.
Analysts slashed earnings estimates well below company forecasts and those who had not previously done so downgraded their ratings on the stock. Most advised investors to dispose of shares and remain on the sidelines until Shiva shows concrete evidence it can meet earnings targets again.
According to First Call, of nine Wall Street analysts who follow the company, seven cut earnings forecasts and or stock ratings on Shiva.
In spite of Shiva's optimism long-term, the new earnings consensus for the year ending January 1998 of the seven analysts was $0.83 per share, down from $1.07 previously.
Murphy said that even if Shiva's plans to focus on its newer switching equipment products succeed, it faces stiff competition from larger rivals like Ascend Communications Inc., Cascade Communications Corp. and U.S. Robotics Inc.
""I didn't encourage people to bottom-fish on this correction,"" she said, referring to her recommendation to brokerage clients.
""When you miss numbers as significantly as they did, it draws a lot of different questions,"" said Matt Barzowskas, an analyst for First Albany. ""You get a lot more conservative.""
""After a quarter like this you have to just step back and evaluate,"" Barzowskas said. ""I am not ready to believe they can do what they think they can do at the moment.""
But while he slashed his earnings estimates for the foreseeable future, the First Albany analyst maintained his buy rating on the stock at its now severely reduced price.
Shiva said it expected revenue for the three months ending Dec. 28 to be $48 million to $50 million, compared with $57.1 million for the prior quarter, which ended in September. The company reported $35.6 million in revenues for the fourth quarter of 1995.
Shiva said it will report final results for the fourth quarter and year on Jan. 23 after the close of the market.

2099,"Shiva Corp stock rose five points Wednesday amid resurgent speculation that it may be an acquisition target of a major network equipment player.
    ""It sure looks like people are speculating that its going to be taking over,"" said Robertson Stephens analyst Paul Johnson, who maintains a long-term attractive on the stock.
    Shiva shares have risen nearly 14 percent in the last two days. By early afternoon Wendesday, the stock was trading at 53-3/4, up 5 points on the day.
    Shiva declined comment on what it called ""a market rumor.""
 ""We have had rumors like this before,"" said Cynthia Deysher, Shiva's chief financial officer. ""Our firm policy on this is not to comment on market rumors,"" she said.
    Several analysts said signs of merger speculation were apparent in the stock's recent gains.
    Cowen &amp; Co analyst Chris Stix noted that Shiva was mentioned in a trade magazine gossip column published Monday as among potential merger candidates in the network industry.
    The article, published in the November 11 issue of Communications Week, spoke of a possible tie-up between rival Ascend Communications Inc and Shiva, among others.
    Stix said another factor behind the rebound in recent weeks of Shiva's share price may be the company's comments in public forums that it has a potential major contract win with a major telecom carrier it has declined to name.
    The Cowen analyst maintains a strong buy on Shiva.
    The stock hit a low of 38 in late September, following a steep three-month decline from its historic high of 87 reached in June, when it was a favorite among momentum investors.
    Although enthusiastic about Shiva's business fundamentals, Johnson discounted any recent product announcements as the cause behind the recent share price moves.
   ""This doesn't appear to me that its product-related. It's too violent,"" he said. ""It's not valuation-related either.""
    Analysts consider Shiva one of two pure plays in the explosively growing market for remote access
telecommunications equipment. The other is high-flying Ascend, the dominant player in the market.
    Johnson said Shiva might also prove attractive to any of the large data networking companies seeking to gain quick market share in the remote access business.
    ""With a company in Shiva's position, I can't think of a company that wouldn't be interested,"" he said.
 Johnson said that Shiva, which by his estimates has 13 percent of the remote access market, may prove attractive to any of the major network industry leaders -- Cisco Systems Inc, 3Com Corp or Bay Networks Inc.
    He left off Cabletron Systems Inc from the list of potential buyers, noting that Cabletron had acquired Network Express Inc in May to beef up its remote access line.
    Shiva has carved out a strategic niche in the market for remote acccess products, which are used by companies, Internet service providers and telecommunications carriers to handle data communications over far-flung wide-area networks.
    Shiva is the No. 3 supplier in remote acccess, behind Ascend, which  holds 40 percent of the market, and U.S. Robotics, a more diversified company with a 31 percent share, according to Johonson's estimates.
    Stix said Shiva, in partnership with Northern Telecom Ltd, has the lead in a new type of network switching product that allows telephone carriers to address the growing overload of their voice networks by Internet data traffic.

2102,"Colombia's cocaine kings, Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela, were sentenced to 21 and 18 years in prison respectively on Friday, but had their terms halved for pleading guilty, bringing a swift rebuke from the United States.
Gilberto Rodriguez, who also was fined $8 million, and his brother -- fined $4.4 million -- will be eligible for extra sentence reductions for working and studying in prison.
The sentences were called ""totally unacceptable"" by U.S. Ambassador Myles Frechette, whose government unsuccessfully called for the extradition of the Rodriguez brothers in July.
The public prosecutor's office said it would appeal the terms, but under Colombia's lenient anti-drug laws this would add little additional jail time.
""The U.S. government and American public opinion will be shocked by these low sentences,"" Frechette told reporters. ""These sentences are totally unacceptable,"" he said.
Gilberto, nicknamed the Chess Player for his cunning criminal mind, headed the powerful Cali drug cartel until his capture in June 1995.
Together with his brother Miguel, the pair masterminded a huge drug trafficking empire, supplying an estimated 80 percent of the world's cocaine and building up a multi-billion dollar fortune in the process.
U.S. officials have said repeatedly that the brothers continue to run their criminal empire from behind the walls of Bogota's La Picota prison.
That allegation, coupled with Friday's ruling by a judge in the city of Cali, could strike a fatal blow to Colombia's hopes of averting more U.S. trade sanctions in March when Washington will decide whether it should remain on a list of pariah states that have failed to cooperate in ther global fight against drugs.
A so-called ""faceless"" judge sentenced Gilberto Rodriguez, 57, to 21 years for drug-trafficking, conspiracy, illicit enrichment, falsification of documents and the illegal possession of weapons.
That term was immediately cut to 10-1/2 years, in return for his plea and prompt confession, and with extra reductions for working and studying in jail he will likely spend about six years in prison. With time already served in custody awaiting trial, Gilberto Rodriguez could be a free in 2002.
His brother Miguel, 53, was sentenced to 18 years, halved for his guilty plea and full confession. He will also be eligible for extra reductions.
The respected Colombian political magazine Semana recently estimated the combined fortune of the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers and two other top traffickers at $50 billion. The brothers may lose part of their fortune under the terms of the new asset forfeiture law passed by Congress in December.
The office of Prosecutor-General Alfonso Valdivieso, an anti-drug crusader and close ally of Washington, said it would use all legal resources to appeal the sentences and see that ""just penalties"" are eventually imposed on the Cali kingpins.
Under current legislation, the brothers faced a maximum of no more than 24 years imprisonment.
National Police chief Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano, who oversaw the arrests of the Rodriguez brothers in June and August of 1995, called Friday's sentences ""a disgrace"" and said they might just as well have been left free.
""I'm not going to continue jailing drug traffickers so they can get out in three years. It's a disgrace,"" he said.

2107,"Moves toward just-in-time roasting and savage cuts in coffee inventories in consumer countries will force exporters, traders and processors to resort to sophisticated financial mechanisms to offset price volatility, the head of the International Coffee Organization said.
ICO chief Celsius Lodder predicted booming growth in risk management measures such as options, futures and secondary instruments and said they would become key in influencing short and medium term coffee prices.  
They will also replace more traditional methods of building up stocks, and other physical strategies, as a buffer to sudden swings in the market, he said.
Meanwhile, in some producer countries, growers may find themselves bearing an increasing responsibility for storing the crop, thereby seeing their costs pushed up.
""Risk management, similar to an insurance contract, will become an increasingly important instrument for exporters, traders and processors,"" Lodder said in a speech organized by Bogota's Los Andes University.  
""Growers and growers' cooperatives will have to take on greater responsibilities for storing inventories. This will push up costs, reduce their cash flow and mean much of the stocks will be stored in remote areas, delaying dispatch,"" the coffee chief said.
Despite the grim message that shifting trends in consumer countries could force their costs up higher, Lodder did offer a ray of hope for Colombian growers, already hard hit by the strengthening peso and the high cost of credit.  
Lodder highlighted the growing opportunity for niche marketing of specialist coffees in traditional markets where consumer palates are becoming more sophisticated even though the overall demand in those areas may have stagnated.
He also talked up prospects of new markets opening in the former Soviet Union and China. Colombia's President Ernesto Samper, and his official delegation, returned from the Far East at the end of last week. His itinerary included China and both he and his Foreign Minister Maria Emma Mejia were upbeat about the chance of selling the Colombian bean to the country's 1.3 billion-strong population.  
During the visit to Beijing and Shanghai, Mejia calculated that if Colombia could sell one cup of coffee a day to every inhabitant of China, the Communist nation would absorb Colombia's entire annual harvest.
National Coffee Growers' Federation chief Jorge Cardenas did his own calculations and worked out that Colombia would have to double its coffee harvest if it was looking to meet Mejia's target.
In his speech, Lodder recognized the ICO's changing role and agreed it was no realistic for it to adopt interventionist strategies in a globalized free market.  
""The patterns of economic and political cooperation seen in the 1960s have been replaced by a new  model, perhaps more realistic and certainly different. There's no consensus for a return to intervention but the ICO is a dynamic organization and it must reflect the current situation and not be constrained by its former role,"" he said.
""I believe the ICO must remain flexible and look for the broadest possible consensus and build on the foundations of our cooperation with trade experts.""
He added that the ICO would concentrate on looking for specific solutions to specific problems as they arose throughout the coffee sector either in production or marketing.
Meanwhile, Colombia's transport system got back to normal this week after a crippling 11-day strike by truckers, which ended with an agreement early last Friday.
There has, nevertheless, been a significant delay in coffee deliveries and Cardenas forecast that about 150,000 60-kg sacks of coffee promised for October delivery would not in fact reach buyers until November.

2116,"Colombian lawmakers met on Thursday in an 11th hour bid to rescue a bill that would strip drug barons of their fortunes and help avoid U.S. economic sanctions.
An 11-member conference committee was debating whether to override the lower house of Congress and empower the government to seize drug-related assets accumulated over the last 20 years.
In a narrow 59-57 vote late Tuesday, the House of Representatives rejected the 20-year time limit, previously approved by the Senate, ruling instead that criminal assets could only be seized if they had been amassed after 1991.
The conference committee meeting was convened under intense pressure from President Ernesto Samper and senior ministers. They condemned the lower house's decision as a ""virtual amnesty"" and raised fears that the United States would impose economic sanctions on Colombia in retaliation for its failure to crack down on billionaire drug lords.
The committee is widely expected to toe the government line and send the bill back to a plenary session of Congress, recommending that the 20-year time limit be reincorporated.
Colombia's business community has taken an unusually outspoken approach and been vociferous in calls to Congress to approve an asset forfeiture law with a 20-year clause.
The United States decertified Colombia as an ally in the drug war last March. Four months later, it withdrew Samper's U.S. entry visa, citing allegations that he financed his 1994 election campaign with drug cartel cash. Foreign Relations Minister Maria Emma Mejia said earlier this week there is a very real prospect of U.S. economic sanctions starting next year.
Other anti-drug legislation that the United States has demanded, such as stiffer sentencing and the reintroduction extradition, has been watered down or sunk in Congress in recent weeks.

2119,"A powerful car bomb exploded in the northwest city of Medellin early on Monday, killing one woman and injuring at least 15 other people, police chief Gen. Alfredo Salgado said.
About 120 pounds (50 kg) of dynamite was packed into a minibus and detonated outside the house of Juan Gomez Martinez, a regional newspaper editor and former provincial governor.
Four unidentified gunmen opened fire on private security guards near Gomez's home before the bomb went off about 5:30 a.m. (1030 GMT), Salgado said.
The dead woman was named as Lucia Bernal, 60, the wife of a civil engineer, who lived close to the site of the blast. Gomez was not home at the time but one of his three sons, Juan Camilo, was injured.
""We don't know the motive for this attack. It is too early to say who was behind it. We don't know if it was leftist guerrillas, drug traffickers or right-wing paramilitaries. We're looking at all the possibilities,"" Salgado said.
Gomez, a member of the opposition Conservative Party, is head of the regional El Colombiano newspaper, which has its headquarters in the industrial city of Medellin, the main city of Antioquia province.
In recent days it has been serializing an extensive interview with Carlos Castano, leader of the country's most-feared right-wing death squad, whose main target is leftist rebels and their suspected supporters.
A few hours after the bomb blast a hitherto unknown group, calling itself the Special Anti-Paramiltary Commando, issued a communique, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters, declaring war on paramilitary groups in Antioquia.
The organisation, claiming to be made up of ex-guerrillas who had laid down their arms, accused serving state governor Alvaro Uribe, of the Liberal Party's right wing, of sponsoring the paramilitaries. Uribe lives close to the site of Monday's blast but it was not clear whether the communique and the attack on Gomez's house were linked.
Medellin has in the past seen some of the worst violence unleashed by the country's powerful drug cartels. It was the scene of multiple attacks by the notorious drug mafia led by the late Pablo Escobar in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The cocaine kingpin waged war against the state in a successful bid to force Congress to ban the extradition of Colombians to the United States.
Last week Congress approved a tough new law designed to strip drug lords of their illicit billion dollar fortunes. More measures including stiffer jail terms are due to be debated in an extended session of Congress this week.

2121,"The Colombian government this week may sidestep congressional stalling and use special powers to force through stiffer anti-drug laws, Justice Minister Carlos Medellin said.
In comments to local media over the weekend, he also called for the draft laws -- which include confiscating drug barons' ill-gotten gains -- to be retroactive, applying to traffickers already jailed.
The retroactivity issue has sparked controversy in parallel moves to end Colombia's constitutional ban on extradition, currently under debate in the senate.
Former justice minister Enrique Parejo believes lawmakers may welcome the decree since it would remove them from the line of fire in any violent backlash by drug traffickers.
""If we don't do something soon then it could be too late. If congress does not make headway on the confiscation (of drug traffickers' property) then I will be looking for the faculty to introduce the legal measures,"" Medellin told the conservative El Nuevo Siglo newspaper.
President Ernesto Samper submitted the tougher anti-drug proposals to congress in July with a firm eye on winning back U.S. certification as an ally in the drugs war, which was withdrawn in March. He has sent repeated requests to legislators to speed up debate, but sessions continue to be dogged by lengthy political wrangling and poor attendance, which has left committees without a quorum.
If the congress fails to pass the measures, the government is expected to announce a decision by Thursday to introduce the new anti-drug laws by decree. But political and legal analysts say the move could raise constitutional issues about whether the government has the right to override congress.
""The government wants to legislate by decree because it fears decertification by the United States again next year, which could spark a fresh crisis which it may not recover from,"" Parejo said in a telephone interview.
""It may be a relief to many congressmen who have links with drug traffickers because there are real signs that the cartels are once again preparing to unleash a new war.""
In the 1980s and early 1990s, the late Pablo Escobar, head of the once-mighty Medellin drug cartel, waged a war of bombings, assassinations and kidnaps against the state in a successful bid to get extradition banned.
The specter of a similar terror campaign is again looming after a series of bombings in recents weeks, including one defused by police which had been planted by the so-called Movement for National Sovereignty in the centre of Cali.

Colombian Defence Minister Juan Carlos Esguerra, police chief Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano and U.S. ambassador Myles Frechette were among mourners at a religious service in Bogota to honour Martin. A lone bugler played the ""Last Post"" and the U.S. flag was draped over Martin's coffin.
""We're not here to bid farewell to a pilot or to a U.S. citizen. We're here to say goodbye to a hero who decided to join us in combatting one of the worst scourges known to mankind -- narco-trafficking,"" Serrano said.
Police said Martin, one of six U.S. civilian pilots working in Colombia under contract with the U.S. State Department, was killed on the first day of his contract. Frechette said he was the first U.S. aviator to die on such a mission.
As police cadets mounted a guard of honour for Martin and three police helicopters flew in formation overhead, Frechette pledged the fatality would not affect U.S.-Colombian cooperation in the drug war.
The question of U.S. personnel taking a direct role in drug or counterinsurgency operations is a traditionally thorny issue because of what Colombian politicians see as the possible infringement of national sovereignty.
Crop-dusting planes come under frequent attack from armed gangs and leftist guerrillas who guard the clandestine drug plantations.
Police chief Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano said Tuesday there was a heavy rebel presence in the area but said there was no indication the aircraft had come under fire. He said a full investigation was under way, adding the most likely cause of the crash was human error or mechanical failure.

2134,"Two Germans, thought to be members of a Colombia leftist guerrilla group, were arrested in the northwest of the country early on Sunday as they tried to smuggle a kidnap victim out of the country, police said.
They were seized at Rionegro international airport, near Medellin, at 1 am local time (0600 GMT) as they tried to bundle a third German, Brigitte Schoene, the wife of a former BASF Chemicals director snatched on Aug. 15, on to a charter plane.
A list of 83 international guerrilla organisations together with a number of false passports were found in the bags of the two detainees -- a 54-year-old man and a 36-year-old woman -- police said.
""I would dare to say that these (German) citizens we captured are the international finance heads and advisers of the National Liberation Army (ELN),"" Gen. Alfredo Salgado, head of the anti-kidnap police in nortwest Antioquia province, told reporters.
The ELN is Colombia's second largest rebel group. It is notorious for its attacks on oil infrastructure and on multi- national companies and their employees.
Gen. Salgado said the two Germans in initial questioning claimed they were carrying out an international peace mission and merely mediating the release of Schoene, seized from her home in Prados de Llanogrande, Antioquia, along with her five-year-old son and chauffeur. Both her son and the chauffeur were released hours after being snatched.
Salgado gave no details of the other guerrilla groups named in the documents seized from the couple and was unable to say if either had been linked to the German urban guerrilla groups of the 1970s.
The German Embassy in Bogota declined to comment on the arrests. Names found on the man's forged ID papers were Norbert Schroder, of Munich, and Jurgen Seidel. The woman's papers gave her name as Silvia Schroder and Isabel Seidel.
The man is also believed to have played a prominent role in the kidnap of a British, Danish and German engineer in Antioquia province earlier this year, Gov. Alvaro Uribe said. The release of the three in return for an undisclosed ransom, paid without the knowledge of the Colombian authorities, led to an angry exchange between Uribe and the German and British embassies.
In comments to reporters on Sunday, Uribe said he had spoken to Schone after her release and that she had confirmed she had been held by the ELN and complained of pyschological torture.
Colombia is the kidnap capital of the world with one person abducted every 2-1/2 hours, according to security experts. About half the kidnaps are attributed to the country's rebel armies.

2135,"Colombian President Ernesto Samper decreed an economic emergency on Monday, warning that the ""economic and social stability of the country"" was under threat.
In a televised speech to the nation, Samper called for urgent belt-tightening measures to cut the central government's yawning fiscal deficit.
The economic emergency, the first in five years, has been decreed for 20 days but could be extended for a maximum of 90 days, presidential sources said. All measures in that period can be introduced without the approval of Congress.
Further austerity measures are scheduled to be announced on Tuesday, government sources said.
Finance Minister Jose Antonio Ocampo later announced the first series of concrete measures aimed at slashing Colombia's foreign debt by more than $800 million this year.
Wilson Borja, head of the 800,000-strong FENALTRASE public sector union, said he feared the government could use crisis powers to cut as many as 19,000 state jobs in the coming days. The union was protesting against a 13.5 percent weighted pay increase, well below annual inflation, announced last week.
""We had initially been planning to launch a stoppage around mid-February but this decree could force us to bring those plans radically forward. We could start a strike as early as next week,"" Borja said.
Anticipating the unions' reaction, Samper said in his televised speech: ""I want to warn you once and for all. Protests and strikes will lead nowhere -- quite simply because although the government has all the goodwill in the world, it is short of money.""
""If the fiscal, exchange rate and unemployment situation continue to deteriorate, the social and economic order will seriously and ostensibly worsen... The economic stability of the country will be severely affected,"" the decree signed by Samper and his cabinet said.
The crisis measure comes against the backdrop of a sharp economic slowdown in 1996, coupled with a steady strengthening of the country's peso currency, which has undermined export activities. The government fiscal deficit has burgeoned and hit 4.0 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1996 up from 0.2 percent in 1995.
In the first of the specific emergency measures, finance chief Ocampo said the planned issuance of $1.8 billion in foreign debt bonds would be reduced by about $800 million.
He announced an overall cut in the national debt programme and unveiled a new tax on private and public companies which looked abroad for fresh loans.
Ocampo said the emergency measures, coupled with income from a recent wave of power plant privatisations, would help to cut the government deficit to 2.5 percent of gross domestic product in 1997, compared to an initial forecast of 3.4 percent.

2138,"Mexican Foreign Minister Jose Angel Gurria on Thursday criticised the United States for its policy of rewarding or punishing countries based on their measures to fight drug trafficking.
During a visit to Colombia, Gurria said the so-called certification process was a barrier to cooperation in the war on drugs and renewed calls for scrapping the system, saying decisions were often based on ulterior motives.
""The process of certification inhibits cooperation and puts the country under scrutiny in a very difficult position. I believe there are much better ways of promoting cooperation,"" Gurria said at a news conference. He added that ""the decision is often based on criteria other than those that one would rationally take into consideration.""
Last year, Colombia was struck off the United States' list of allies in the drug war. Mexico came under severe criticism but managed to get certification and escape sanctions.
Mexico has since set up a ministerial contact group to address the issue with Washington, and that has led to an improved climate between the two governments, Gurria said.
Colombia has continued to come under heavy criticism from the United States for its perceived failure to crack down hard enough on drug trafficking.
Politicians and political analysts were divided on whether Colombia would regain certification this March in the wake of of a new law to strip drug kingpins of narcotics profits.
The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration estimates that 80 percent of the world's cocaine is supplied by Colombia while more than half that on the streets of U.S. cities has been transported through Mexico.

2146,"Colombia has taken the first step to lifting a constitutional ban on extradition but the country's crusading anti-drug prosecutor on Wednesday dismissed the move as virtually meaningless.
Amid threats of a repeat of the bloodbath unleashed by drug gangs against extradition in the late 1980s, a Senate panel approved draft legislation late on Tuesday to lift the prohibition on sending Colombians abroad to stand trial
But chief prosecutor Alfonso Valdivieso said the measure prohibited as much as it allowed and threatened to hog-tie the government in endless red tape. He said the legislation should be strengthened before a final vote in Congress.
""What we should be doing here is lifting the 1991 ban, which was a national disgrace. But the text approved by the Senate doesn't represent any advance,"" he said. ""I'm not saying it's a step back but it leaves us in exactly the same position.""
The draft legislation approved by an 11-8 vote by the Senate constitutional committee was also unlikely to satisfy Colombia's critics in the United States.
If the draft survives a required seven more congressional votes, it would open the door to extradition in some isolated cases. But it would not be retroactive, ensuring that the Cali cartel drug lords jailed last year, the target of a U.S. extradition request in June, will never see U.S. courts.
Furthermore, the legislation would prevent the extradition of criminals who voluntarily surrendered to Colombian justice and forbid their handover if they risked receiving stiffer sentences abroad than those they would face at home.
One of the main arguments by U.S. authorities, who have long pressed for the extradition of drug traffickers, is that Colombian justice is too lenient and convicted drug lords continue running their criminal empires from behind bars.
Drug lords led by Pablo Escobar, the late and notoriously violent leader of the Medellin cartel, waged a nationwide campaign of bombings, kidnappings and assassinations in the late 1980s and early 1990s to force the government to impose the constitutional ban on extradition passed by Congress in 1991. Memories of the thousands of people who died in that campaign of terror are still fresh.
Death threats against extradition supporters have been scrawled in the last week on walls around Cali, home to the powerful syndicate that edged out Escobar's organization to become the world's major cocaine supplier.
A group calling itself ""Colombians For Peace"" issued pamphlets reminding people of the bloodbath of the 1980s because of the extradition issue.  ""Today that situation is once again threatening Colombia. Avoiding it depends on the government, congress and our judges,"" it said.
President Ernesto Samper, dogged by allegations of his own ties to drug lords, has said the extradition debate was poorly timed and insisted that priority should be given to his own proposal to introduce stiffer penalties for drug crimes.

2149,"Colombia denied on Monday that its army was linked to paramilitary death squads and said the world should focus instead on the ""cursed alliance"" between leftist guerrillas and drug traffickers.
""Narco-guerrilla groups are heading a disinformation campaign throughout the world. ... The United States and the world must wake up to the new threat posed by the cursed alliance between drug traffickers, guerrillas and international mafias,"" Defence Minister Juan Carlos Esguerra said.
The comments were part of a fiery response to a report issued in Bogota by New York-based Human Rights Watch.
The organisation's report, titled ""Colombia's Killer Networks,"" concluded, ""The military has not only created paramilitary groups but allows virtually all of them to carry out political killings when it serves a common purpose, ridding the country of perceived guerrilla support.""
The rights group, citing confidential defence documents, said U.S. military advisers fuelled the surge in death squads after helping restructure Colombia's gathering of military intelligence in 1990.
The organisation's legal adviser, Jamie Fellner, alleged that top army commanders Gen. Harold Bedoya and Gen. Manuel Jose Bonett were ""accomplices"" or tolerated such groups in a systematic ""dirty war"" on political dissidents.
Human Rights Watch echoed calls by London-based Amnesty International last month demanding the immediate suspension of U.S. and European military aid and arms sales to Colombia until human rights violations were curbed.
Human Rights Watch estimated that much of the $322 million in U.S. military aid to Colombia since 1989 had been handed out to counterinsurgency battalions accused of rights violations.
A U.S. State Department spokesman said in Washington on Monday there were no plans for tighter checks.
The Colombian Army was dramatically humiliated when the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia overran a jungle post in southern Colombia on Aug. 30, killing 27 soldiers and taking 60 prisoners.
""These soldiers are being kept in cells reminiscent of the infamous tiger cages seen in Vietnam. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch would do well to investigate those abuses instead of inventing new charges,"" Esguerra said.

Czech share prices were mostly steady on the Prague Stock Exchange throughout the week, with little movement expected soon as the holiday season slowly winds up.
The PX50 index edged up 3.6 points from Monday to close at 568.6 on Thursday.
Leading trading were SPT Telecom and Komercni Banka, though SPT's movements were largely characterised as ""accounting procedures"" that saw the issue gain as much as 102 crowns one session, only to lose the same amount the following day.
""The final price (of SPT) was not the real market price, but because average prices are not used for the close, it gives an artificial final number,"" said Jan Sykora of Wood and Company. SPT closed on Thursday at 3,340 crowns.

2169,"The Czech Republic and Spain played out a scoreless draw in their World Cup group six qualifier on Wednesday, in a match that never lived up to expectations.
The Czechs were facing their first big test since they reached the Euro 96 final, while Real Madrid's teenage striker Raul was looking to spark a depleted Spanish attack in his first full international.
Both sides opened their World Cup campaigns last month with high-scoring victories over the two weakest teams in the group, Spain winning 6-2 in the Faroe Islands and the Czechs thrashing Malta 6-0.
But Yugoslavia have already collected three wins and Slovakia two against the same two hapless victims and neither team could afford to give ground in Prague.
Like two heavyweights feeling each other out in the early rounds, both teams started tentatively, waiting to pounce on the other's mistakes.
The Spaniard's were the first to flinch when Kaiserslautern striker Pavel Kuka's cross found an unmarked Karel Poborsky just outside the crease. But the Manchester United midfielder failed to control the ball, wasting what would turn out be one of the game's few good scoring chances.
Next it was the Czechs turn to falter. Newcastle United goalkeeper Pavel Srnicek, winning his first cap in over a year, tried to clear the ball, but hit attacker Alfonso Perez and watched helplessly as it rolled just wide of the net.
The Czechs picked up their play in the second half, putting Spain on their heels for the rest of the game.
""I don't think we lost points tonight because they are such an excellent team. They played strongly in the defence and its too bad we missed out on the two great chances we had,"" said Czech striker Patrik Berger.
Teams:

2172,"A Czech central bank scheme to buy doubtful debts of smaller banks and restore stability to the banking sector has attracted interest from about 10 banks, the Czech news agency reported on Wednesday.
CTK, quoting central bank spokesman Martin Svehla, said that of the 13 banks allowed to participate in the plan, the number that had expressed an interest in joining ""is nearing 10"".
Central bank officials were not immediately available for comment.
The Czech National Bank (CNB) outlined the programme in mid-October followed the failure of Kreditni Banka in August -- the 11th bank in which the CNB had intervened -- and the politicisation of the case which had undermined confidence especially in small banks.
Under the plan, participating banks must follow strict conditions and allow the central bank to make management changes where needed. CNB officials said the programme was not aimed at resolving a problem at any one bank.
The plan will be open to all small private banks with total paid-in capital of 12.5 billion crowns ($458.5 million) and total assets of not more than 30 billion crowns.
The state-run Konsolidacni Banka would buy the banks' doubtful assets at face value.
The banks will be required to buy back the assets after around five to seven years, again priced at their nominal value, minus credits recovered by Konsolidacni from the debtors in the meantime.
Banks seeking to participate will be held to strict requirements which include sticking to a three-year stabilisation plan and an agreement to attain an eight percent capital adequacy ratio.
Banks also must maintain cost controls, profitability and liquidity as well as agreeing to frequent reviews by the central bank.
The maximum purchase of debt by Konsolidacni can total up to 110 percent of a single bank's paid-in capital, meaning a maximum exposure for the state of 13.7 billion crowns in total if all eligible banks participated.
The programme is voluntary based on a contract with the CNB, and the central bank said it would not reveal which banks elected to participate.
Banks eligible include Ekoagrobanka, Union Banka, Evrobanka, Prvni Mestska Banka, COOP Banka, Pragobanka, Plzenska Banka, Foresbank, Bankovni Dum Skala, Moravia Banka, Universal Banka, Zemska Banka, and Banka Hana.
Money for the scheme is to come primarily from state- controlled Konsolidacni Banka and if necessary from the CNB itself. A newly created unit of Konsolidacni, Ceska Financni s.r.o., will administer the programme.
Any losses from the programme are to be covered by the National Property Fund (NPF), the state privatisation agency.

2178,"Czechs cold-shouldered their newly-created Senate on Saturday, turning out in record low numbers for elections which were supposed to be a key test for the minority government of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.
The apathy suggested that the real winners might not be Klaus's Civic Democratic Party (ODS) or the opposition Social Democrats, but the far-right Republicans who boycotted the Senate elections and told fellow Czechs to follow suit.
Unofficial figures from the two-day first round, which ended on Saturday, indicated that turnout would be well under 40 percent, by far the lowest in the four parliamentary elections held since the 1989 fall of communism.
Opposition Social Democrat leader Milos Zeman bewailed Czechs' apathy towards the upper house, but predicted that turnout would improve in the second round on November 22-23.
""I think that no party can be happy with the low election turnout, because people that don't turn out for the Senate elections are giving up their civic rights, the right to vote, the right to decide,"" Zeman told reporters.
No national figures were available immediately after the polls closed at 2.00 p.m. (1300 GMT).
But preliminary, unofficial data from some of the 81 constituencies showed Klaus's centre-right ODS doing well against a bleak background on turnout.
In the Western city of Plzen, turnout was just 36 percent with the ODS candidate expected to face a Social Democrat in the second round, the Czech news agency CTK reported.
If no candidate wins more than half the vote in the first round, the top two candidates go through to the runoff.
In the northern mining town of Most, turnout was 26 percent with the ODS candidate leading trade union leader Richard Falbr, who is running for the Social Democrats.
Pundits have billed the Senate elections as an indicator of whether the Czech Republic can break out of a political impasse following inconclusive lower house polls which stripped Klaus's conservative coalition of its majority last June.
But the apparent low turnout, which compares with 76.4 percent in June, seems a vindication of the Republicans and their leader Miroslav Sladek.
Sladek regards the Senate as a waste of time and money. ""They had nowhere to dump the political zombies so they established the Senate,"" he told a recent anti-election rally, adding that it ""would be lazy, useless and expensive"".
Conventional wisdom has been that if ODS did well in the Senate Klaus might provoke early lower house polls to regain the coalition's majority. If ODS lost to the Social Democrats, however, he could be forced to resign after seven years leading economic reform as finance minister and since 1992 as premier.

2181,"The Czech September trade deficit is expected to grow by between 13 and 15 billion crowns after a 14.7 billion crown monthly deficit in August, a Reuters poll of Czech economists showed on Wednesday.
Czech trade figures for the first nine months are scheduled to be released by the Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) at 0900 local time (0700 GMT) on Thursday.
Most economists surveyed said they expect steady growth in the deficit and few surprises.
""It's still too early to talk about a period of stabilisation in the deficit, I think that will come in 1997 when imports level off and exports strengthen,"" Boris Gomez, an analyst at ING Barings told Reuters.
Whatever the deficit in September, the nine-month trade gap is sure to be a record, after the January-August figure reached 100.9 billion crowns, more than all of the 1995's total shortfall of 95.7 billion crowns.
The January-September 1995 trade deficit was 62.3 billion crowns.
Most analysts agreed a 13-15 billion September gap would be in-line with prevailing trends, and on target for the estimated deficit of 150-160 billion crowns.
Analysts say the trade balance has been hurt by a downturn in the economies of western Europe earlier in the year, and a the effects of a recovery of demand in western Europe have yet to make an impact.
The government and central bank, however, has repeatedly ruled out a devaluation of the crown to boost exports.
Analysts point to mid-1997 as a crucial time in which the import wave -- which is aimed at modernising industries -- must show results in productivity growth and competitiveness.
Economists said the deficit could be financed this year, but might pose problems in the second half of 1997.

Becker, who tore a ligament in his right wrist during the third round at this year's Wimbledon, was in pain after training and dropped out of his scheduled second round match against Czech Martin Damm.
""Boris said his wrist was too sore and that he would not be able to play this evening,"" ATP Tour Supervisor Gayle Bradshaw said.
On Wednesday evening, Becker cruised to a 6-3 6-4 victory over Denmark's Frederik Fetterlein. During the match he held his wrist several times.
The world number six tried to return to the circuit last month but the injury forced him to retire from the first round in Bucharest, lose in the second round in Basle and withdraw from Lyon two weeks ago.
Becker's absence has set back his plan to qualify for a record 12th appearance at the season-ending ATP Tour championship. He currently trails South African Wayne Ferreira for the eighth and final spot in Hannover.
Second seed Ferreira scraped through to the quarter-finals in Ostrava with a 7-6 5-7 7-5 victory over Dutch qualifier Joost Winnink.
Ferreira, ranked seventh in the world, was stretched to the limit by Winnink. Their absorbing baseline battle ended in the 12th game of the deciding set when Winnink's backhand let him down on three successive occasions.

2190,"The Czech trade deficit jumped sharply in October, rising nearly 16 billion crowns, but analysts said they were not alarmed by the rise which is inline with their full year forecasts.
The Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) said on Tuesday the trade gap for the first 10 months of the year hit a record 125.5 billion crowns, up from a revised 109.6 billion crown shortfall for January-September.
The CSU, the Ministry of Industry and Trade, and most analysts, however, have predicted the deficit -- accelerated by an economic slowdown with the country's main trading partner, Germany -- will finish at a record 150-160 billion crowns.
""The figures are developing according to forecasts. It's clear that the year-end deficit will be 150-160 billion crowns,"" said Kamil Janacek, chief economist at Komercni Banka.
""I'm not surprised by the jump since the economic revival of Germany will only show up in export growth in the first half of next year, not in one or two months,"" he added.
The CSU in a statement said that imports rose by 14.4 percent year-on-year for the 10-month period, down from 15.2 percent for January to September, while exports rose by 5.2 percent, down from 5.9 percent for the first nine months.
It added that strong growth in machinery and transport equipment imports continued, growing by 19.1 percent year- on-year and accounting for 38.3 percent of total imports.
Analysts said they were encouraged by the rise in this sector, saying that imports of this nature are needed to restructure industry, allowing it to produce more competitive goods for exporting.
""The trend seems unchanged. The financing of future economic growth is being done with imports, especially in the heavy machinery sector,"" Boris Gomez, an analyst at ING Barings told Reuters.

Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, a monetarist-economist, has said the record trade deficit is ""not tragic"" saying it has come in part from a temporary foreign investment wave.
The Czech crown reacted indifferently to the trade figures, hovering around three percent above its dollar/mark basket parity, where it was for most of Monday.
The crown was trading at 26.919 to the dollar at 1230 local time (1130 GMT).
The rate implies a deviation from the midpoint of the currency basket of +3.09 percent, after the central bank's fixing on earlier on Tuesday at +3.00 percent.
""The market is neither alarmed nor pleased with the figure. If the deficit hits the forecast level, I doubt we will see any significant change in the currency's value,"" said one local forex dealer.

2192,"A strong showing in runoff Senate elections at the weekend may breathe new life into the Czech governing coalition, but it will do little to resuscitate the country's dormant capital market, analysts said on Sunday.
The minority coalition of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus took 52 of 81 seats in the newly-created upper house of parliament, following the second round of voting, well ahead of the centre-left opposition Social Democrats which took 25 seats.
The Senate is a mostly advisory body with limited legislative powers, but the election was the first test at the polls for Klaus since his coalition lost its lower house majority in general elections in June.
But analysts said that while the news could have been worse for investors, the strong centre-right showing does nothing to solve the maladies which continue to plague the market.
""I think the market's reaction will be fairly positive, but in a few weeks time it will probably have settled down into acknowledging that this has not changed the situation of the past four or five months at all,"" Charles Robinson of the research house HILFE told Reuters.
""It has just not made it worse,"" he added.
The coalition's strong showing in the first round of voting last week helped spur domestic investor interest, pushing the market up in its wake.
Analysts said, however, that with this fillip already built into prices, stocks will probably not rise too much further in the near future.
The Czech crown also gained some ground against its dollar/mark basket on the back of the first round results, but it too should not rise significantly on the final outcome of the vote, they added.
""It seems that the final results of the elections reflect the current structure of the political situation here so I don't expect any significant changes or amy development as a result of it,"" said Miroslav Nosal of Patria Finance.
Analysts said that until legislation is tightened to bring about more market transparency and stronger minority shareholder protection, key foreign investor interest will remain low.
""I think there has been a result built into the market from the good Senate results last week, and everyone expected that the coalition would win this second round,"" said one analyst.
""There are still other difficulties that will keep the market relatively depressed such as a lack of regulation that will keep foreign investors away. This is a more important issue over the medium-term than the Senate elections.""

2194,"Germany's David Prinosil, in a homecoming of sorts, overwhelmed Czech Petr Korda 6-1 6-2 in the final of the $475,000 Czech Indoor Open on Sunday.
The 23-year-old German, who was born near here in Olomouc and emigrated to Germany when he was 14, took control of the match from the beginning, keeping Korda off balance with his booming serve and crisp groundstrokes.
As was the case all week, Prinosil used his deft return of service as an offensive weapon, seizing on both break points he had to take the first set in just 22 minutes.
It was more of the same in the second set, with world number 49 Korda taking more chances, but failing to unsettle the German, who was playing in only his second final on the tour after he won in Newport last year.
Korda was on the verge of breaking Prinosil in the fourth game, but the world number 58 blasted four straight service winners to take the game, and then ripped two crosscourt forehands to break in the fifth and seventh games in a match that lasted just 50 minutes.  
""If someone told me I wouldn't lose a set all week, I would have said they were crazy. I don't think I have ever played this well,"" said Prinosil, who enjoyed straight set victories over Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek, American Todd Martin and Briton Tim Henman on his way to the final and a prize of $64,000.
Korda said: ""I was a little drained from yesterday's match and he hit the ball well. The points were short, which gave me little chance to take control of the match.""
Korda needed two hours late on Saturday to defeat Davis Cup team mate Martin Damm in three sets while Prinosil beat Henman in just 56 minutes.

2198,"Senate runoff elections on Friday and Saturday should have little impact on Czech capital markets, as investors focus on macroeconomic fundamentals, not political influences.
Analysts said last weekend's first round of voting gave a mild boost to the Czech crown and the Prague Stock Exchange, and unless results from the second round of voting on Friday and Saturday vary greatly, little further boost should be seen.
""Provided that nothing drastic happens, it's pretty much a non-starter from a foreign investor point of view. I think that for the markets, it will be pretty much a non-event,"" Jay King, of Wood and Company, told Reuters.
In the first round of voting last weekend, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus's right-wing Civic Democratic Party (ODS) posted a strong result, capturing over 36.5 percent of the national vote, an increase of some six percent from June lower house elections where his coalition lost its majority.
The opposition Social Democrats were second with 20.3 percent. The rest of the vote was thinly split among coalition parties and the Communists but only 35 percent of the electorate voted.
Of the 81 Senate seats, the ODS won three outright in the first round and 76 of their candidates go into the runoff, compared with 48 for the CSSD. In 47 constituencies, the runoff is a straight fight between the two main parties.
Analysts said that with the two main parties assured of dominating the Senate, a body which will have limited powers anyway, little change appears imminent for the country's economic, or political course.
""Our expectation is ODS gaining somewhere around half of the total, and including the rest of the coalition it might be well over 50 seats. I don't think there should be any surprises,"" said Radek Maly, an economist at Citibank Prague.
Following last weekend's vote, the PSE, mired in a two month long slump began to edge higher, gaining some four percent over the week.
But dealers said the gains were based more on weak local buying than a change in sentiment from key foreign investors.
The crown too, ratcheted up slightly after the first round of voting, but has since steadied at 2.9 percent stronger than its dollar/mark basket midpoint.
Some analysts said foreign investors might be tempted, as they were the previous week, to play on a strong Klaus victory early on Monday, but any gain based on the political situation would be short lived.
""There may be some bias toward a stronger Czech crown,"" said Petr Korous, a dealer at Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka. ""There's no other factor, more or less the basic impulse for that (a stronger crown) was really because of the elections, and then the subsequent recovery of the capital markets.""
Citibank's Maly added: ""I wouldn't foresee any major changes in the fixed income market. The fixed income market is rather less sensitive to these political events than is the FX (foreign exchange) market.""

2203,"Media magnate Rupert Murdoch said on Tuesday that the first quarter performance of his global media group, The News Corp Ltd, had been below expectations, but that he was still confident of a 20 percent profit rise in 1996/97.
""I am on record as saying that we expect a 20 percent increase in profit for the year,"" Murdoch told a packed News Corp annual meeting in Adelaide.

He said revenues at the Fox U.S. television business had begun 1996/97 slowly because of of the Atlanta Olympic Games, the rights to which were held by a rival network.
Australian newspaper revenues would be flat in 1996/97, he said.
However, News Corp's British newspapers were doing extremely well, with circulation at The Sunday Times climbing with little promotion while advertising in Britain was booming.
Murdoch, News Corp's chief executive and chairman, also announced the group now had US$2.5 billion in cash in the bank after recent U.S. bond issues and would leave it there.

2205,"Australasian food group Goodman Fielder Ltd is expected to report a slightly higher annual net profit before abnormals early on Thursday, as firmer margins in some areas are seen largely offset by higher grain costs.
""I'll be looking for some margin growth, but also there's been some strong raw materials cost increases,"" one Sydney analyst said, adding he was forecasting a pre-abnormals net profit of just under A$100 million.  
The median forecast in BZW Australia's Barceps survey of analysts was for a A$100.0 million pre-abnormals net profit for the year to June 30, 1996.
Forecasts ranged from A$97.0 million to A$102.3 million, compared with the A$97.3 million profit posted in 1994/95.
""There'll be a big impact from the grain prices in the second half and going into the first half of this (1996/97 year),"" another Sydney analyst said, estimating extra grain costs of about A$60 million.  
But analysts expected the cost of grain, a major input in Goodman's breadmaking and chicken operations, would ease back later in calendar 1996.
The higher grain costs were likely to have been offset somewhat in the second half of 1995/96 by lower packaging and palm oil costs, some analysts said.
Profit expectations are in a tight band in part because of Goodman's own comments about the result in early August.
Goodman chief executive David Hearn said then that the pre-abnormal profit would be around A$100 million.  
""We're saying that there will be a small increase in pre-abnormal profit in the 0-5 percent range from last year and since we made A$97 million last year, zero to five means somewhere between A$97 and A$102 million,"" Hearn said.
Goodman then also announced it would post abnormal losses of up to A$75 million in 1995/96, including a revaluation of its loss-making poultry operations.
This would produce a net profit after abnormals of around A$25 million, Hearn said then.  
Analysts said however most of the interest would be centred on Goodman's strategic plans for recovery from its profit slump of recent years.
Goodman Fielder shares closed down a cent at A$1.31 on Wednesday.

2209,"Stock-feed producer Ridley Corp Ltd forecast on Wednesday that slow demand and margin pressures would produce a flat first half year profit, but that a grain price slump would help boost profits for the full 1996/97 year.
""All things considered we expect overall company after tax earnings to be in line with those of last year for the first half,"" Ridley Chairman John Keniry told the group's annual meeting.  
Strong pasture growth in some areas which had significantly cut demand for stockfeed, along with margin pressures from high wheat prices earlier the year had combined to push Australian stockfood earnings lower in the first quarter of the year to June 30, 1997.
First quarter earnings from Ridley's AgriProducts division had been below both budget forecast and last year's results, Keniry said.
Keniry said Ridley expected another good result from its Canadian stock food supplier, Feed-rite, to offset the falls from Australia's AgriProducts in the first half.  
""For the first quarter Feed-Rite's earnings before interest and tax have exceeded by a comfortable margin both budget and last year,"" Keniry said.
But he said a sharp slump in grain prices, one of Ridley's key inputs, could boost margins again in Australia later in the year if prices stayed down.
""When we look to the full year, we must recognise a very rapid decline in the past month or so in grain prices, and the somewhat unpredicatble impact on both us and our customers of these changes,"" Keniry said.  
""Nevertheless on a full year basis, a cautious approach would be to say that we presently expect to come in slightly ahead of last year,"" he said.
Ridley said last month it expected continued profit growth and was optimistic of achieving another record performance in the 1996/97 year to June 30.
It reported an operating profit of A$36.27 million million in 1995/96, up 14.3 percent on the previous year and hard on the heels of three to four years of significant profit rises.  
Later, Ridley managing director Gary Busenshut reiterated the flat immediate outlook but more buoyant longer term prospects for the year.
""As we harvest between October and January, we're going to see some improvement in margins,"" he said.
Busenshut said Ridley also continued to focus on further acquisitions both in Australia and in North America, particularly now that its A$98 million takeover bid for Australian malster Joe White Maltings Ltd looked unlikely to succeed.  
The A$5.44 per share offer was rejected by Joe White and Ridley has said it would not increase the offer before it closes on November 8. Ridley now has about 18 percent of Joe White.
Ridley would continue to look at potential malting acquisitions in Australia and stock-feed milling operations in North America, Busenshuts said.
He said Ridley had had discussions with potential feed-milling targets in North America and could carry out an acquisition worth about A$100 million by the end of the March quarter of 1997 if it decided to. Ridley's shares closed up one cent at A$1.70.  -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1812

2216,"Australian-based metals recycler Simsmetal Ltd on Friday painted a bleak picture for world scrap metal prices over the year ahead and said this meant the group's net profit for 1996/97 would be lower than in 1995/96.
But it said it remained confident it could take advantage of a recovery in world markets when it came and was currently in talks to buy a large British scrap metal business.
Simsmetal managing director John Crabb told the annual meeting that scrap prices had softened dramatically to their lowest levels in almost four years over the last two months.  
""Until there is an improvement in the major economies of Europe and Asia and the resulting increase in demand for metals, we expect trading conditions to remain very difficult with volumes, margins and earnings below our expectations,"" Crabb said.
He later told reporters profits for the year to June 30, 1997 would be below the A$46.7 million posted in 1995/96 -- a result that was itself 23 percent down on a year ago.
""It will be lower for the full year,"" Crabb said.  
Simsmetal had previously only said it saw difficult conditions prevalent in the first quarter of 1996/97 continuing into the second quarter, with second quarter profits falling.
In mid-October, Simsmetal announced its net profit for the first quarter of 1996/97 fell 34 percent to A$8.28 million.
Crabb said the world construction markets which used the long steel produced by electric furnaces supplied by Simsmetal remained weak and had no immediate prospect of improvement.
""Our view is that we should start to see some improvement (in ferrous metals prices) towards the end of calendar 1997, we may see it in the middle (of calendar 1997),"" he said.  
""We can't see too much on the horizon at this time,"" he said.
Crabb also said Simsmetal was in talks to buy a large British business in the same area as Simsmetal, but he said he could not give any more details as he was bound by confidentiality agreements.
""It's in the U.K. For us it will be quite large,"" he said.
""We still need to balance our portfolio there, so that we've got a good broad coverage,"" he said.
""We'll use either some cash or our unusued borrowing lines. We've got no problems funding it.""  
He said Simsmetal had ended the first quarter with about A$62 million cash on hand.
""I guess we'd only be using 55-60 percent of our borrowing capacity at the moment.""
Simsmetal had total non-current borrowings of A$54.11 million as at June 30, 1996, giving a total warchest for possible acquisitions of about A$115 million.
Earlier in the annual meeting, Crabb said that any closure of the Broken Hill Pty Co Pty Ltd's Newcastle steel plant would not affect Simsmetals operations.  
Crabb said Simsmetal supplies most of its products to BHP's Sydney mini-mill and its Port Kembla plant, south of Sydney.
""Maybe it will make life easier for us because we will be able to buy more scrap,"" Crabb said, responding to a shareholders question.
Simsmetal's shares were up one cent at A$6.89 at 2.40 p.m. (0340 GMT).

2218,"Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd is likely to benefit from the planned US$20 billion merger of MCI Communications Corp and British Telecommunications Plc , Australian media analysts said on Monday.
They said News, which already has a wide-ranging partnership with MCI, would strengthen its global media interests on the coat-tails of the creation of the world's second largest telecommunications group.
""It means they'll be in bed with a bigger more powerful global telephony group,"" one senior Sydney media analyst said.  
Analysts also said the BT-MCI merger would stabilise New Corp's partnership with MCI, which had seemed increasingly strained in recent months. ""It seems that MCI and News haven't been getting on lately, whereas News and BT have been getting on a lot better,"" said the senior Sydney analyst.
The prospect of MCI selling its nine percent stake in News Corp over the next year had suppressed News Corp's shares in the last month. ""There was a view that MCI wasn't real happy with it (the partership) and may sell out, but now nothing's going to happen for 12 months at least,"" said another Sydney analyst.  
""The implications for News are quite positive,"" the analyst said.
A Melbourne analyst said some in the market were a bit worried that MCI was preparing to  to sell down their stake over the next 12 months. ""The fact that BT may combine with MCI reduces that risk for now at least,"" the analyst said.
MCI and News Corp announced a broad alliance in May 1995, under which MCI bought a nine percent stake in News for US$1.35 billion and acquired an option to increase that stake up to 13.5 percent. They agreed, amoug other things, to jointly set up an American satelite television operation -- ASkyB.  
But progress with ASkyB has been slow and other smaller joint ventures have failed to fire.
However, the Australian analysts said they would remain somewhat cautious given bearish comments on Sunday by MCI.
MCI announced that it would cut its stake in ASkyB to 20 percent from 50 percent.
Analysts said this was not surprising as News Corp and MCI had said recently they wanted new partners in the venture.  
But MCI Chief Executive Bert Roberts also told Reuters on Sunday that no major new launches were expected from the venture with News Corp and that MCI would sell to News a US$700 million satellite license if it could.
He also said MCI was unlikely to take up its option to increase its stake in News, a comment seen by analysts as symptomatic of Roberts' increasing unhappiness with the deal.
Analysts also said there was the potential for a regulatory block to links between News, its 40 percent owned BSkyB Plc and BT.  
""There's an outside risk that British regulatory bodies could try and block the News-BSkyB-BT side of it,"" said another BT analyst.
Other analysts said the dilution involved, with BT owning nine percent of a 40 percent stake in BSkyB, would assuage regulatory concerns. The likely election of a British Labour government also reduced that risk.
""They're banking on (Labour leader) Tony Blair winning government and deregulating cross media rules in the United Kingdom,"" said another Sydney analyst.  
However another analyst pointed to the recent banning by British regulator Oftel of a joint marketing campaign between BT and BSkyB as a sign of the rocky road ahead for News and BT.

2226,"Almost 300 students and workers from the islands of Kiribati were adrift in the central Pacific on Wednesday aboard a crowded charter ship crippled by a fire, officials said.
The 1,000-tonne MV Maasmond appealed for help on Tuesday night after losing power through the fire in the engine room.
It was found by a Royal New Zealand Airforce Orion rescue plane drifting about 800 kms (500 miles) east of the Kiribati island of Tarawa with 290 passengers on board.
""The Orion located it this afternoon and was told via radio that it's in no immediate distress and has enough food and water for five days,"" Airforce Squadron Leader Ron Irons told Reuters from the RNZAF's base in Nandi, Fiji.
""It has partially restored its electric power, but it has no wasy to start its engine,"" Irons said.
An electrical fire in a switchboard in the engine room shut down the ship's electrical systems late on Tuesday, leaving the converted freighter without power and still two days sailing from the nearest land.
The ship's charterer, Kiribati businessman Waysang Kumkee, said the MV Maasmond's insurers would pay for another ship to tow it back to Tarawa.
The 64.5-metre (210 foot) Maasmond was chartered to carry 290 passengers, mostly Kiribati students and workers, and 400 tonnes of cargo to Christmas Island from Tarawa, Kumkee said.
A tugboat was likely to take two days to reach the stricken ship and another two days to tow it back to Tarawa, he said, adding the passengers had plenty of food and water to last the four days.
""It's not a problem. If they run out they can easily borrow some of the cargo,"" Kumkee told Reuters by telephone from Tarawa, one of a group of coral atolls about 5,000 kms (3,000 miles) north-east of Sydney.
The cargo included rice and tinned food.
None of the passengers or crew had been injured in the fire and the only problem on board was likely to be boredom given the ship's video players were out of action. ""With no videos, they'll be a bit bored,"" Kumkee said.
Most of the passengers were sitting or sleeping under canvas on blankets on the deck, he said.
They would be reduced to playing cards and their guitars until their rescue, he added.
The MV Maasmond is registered in Kingstown in St Vincent and Grenadines, according to the Lloyds List, and has had engine trouble in the past.
In 1992, it underwent engine repairs for ten weeks after encountering cyclones on a cruise through the Pacific.

Surging profits from Brambles' U.S. and European CHEP pallet hire joint venture with Britain's GKN Plc compensated for otherwise slow growth from Australia, the company said.
""The continuing improvement in our performance reflects, in part, the successful rationalisation of our wholly owned businesses and strong growth from our CHEP joint ventures,"" Brambles Chief Executive John Fletcher said.
""CHEP USA, in particular, continues to justify our confidence in its long-term growth prospects in the region,"" he said in Brambles' profit statement.
Brambles' net profit rose 120.2 percent to A$215.1 million (US$169.9 million) for the year to June 30 from A$97.7 million in 1994/95. The previous year's result was undermined by an abnormal loss of $112.3 million.
Stripping away abnormals, profit for 1995/96 rose 15.8 percent to A$214.8 million, at the top end of analysts' expectations.
Pre-tax profits rose 13 percent and 30 percent from Europe and the United States respectively, while Australian profits rose eight percent.
""Overseas profits grew at twice the rate in Australia and the trend is likely to continue,"" Fletcher said.
""In particular we expect further contributions from CHEP in Europe and North America,"" he said.
Fletcher later told Reuters this strong performance from Brambles' non-Australian operations had encouraged it to actively look at further acquisitions outside Australia.
""You should anticipate some acquisition work in the Northern Hemisphere, but in businesses we already operate in here,"" he said, referring to areas like transport equipment rentals and records managements.
Looking ahead, he said strong contributions from the United States and Europe should continue to offset soft Australian conditions and help produce profit growth.
""We haven't got an expectation that we will get too much help from this economy...for at least another six months,"" he said. ""But all in all we've got enough things going to see another (profit) increase for this year,"" he said.
The result generally pleased analysts, who also pointed to the strong U.S. pallet operations as the main bullish note.
""CHEP USA is the outstanding area,"" said Macquarie Equities analyst Ian Myles.
""As long as they're saying positive things about CHEP in the USA then they'll be alright and there's a reasonable amount of momentum there,"" another Sydney transport analyst said.

At issue is whether Time Warner, the United States' second largest cable operator, will carry Murdoch's soon-to-be launched competitor to CNN.
News Corp is claiming US$1 billion in damages from Time Warner and Turner, saying their decision not to carry News' 24-hour Fox News Service showed they were stifling competition.
""They promised me very firmly we'd have nine million subscribers and when the day came to sign the document, they weren't there,"" Murdoch said of the Time Warner decision.
Turner was forced to apologise last week for comparing Murdoch to Adolf Hitler, while Murdoch has described CNN as liberal and his executives have said Turner was monopolistic.
Murdoch also reaffirmed News' bullish outlook for profits.
""If the American economy holds where it is and the British one does, yes certainly (the 20 percent rise is attainable),"" he told the Courier Mail.
""But it is still early days to be saying that,"" the newspaper quoted Murdoch as saying.
News said after its 1995/96 results in late August that a 20-percent profit rise in the year to June 30, 1997 was very attainable. News posted a A$1.02 billion (US$790 million) net profit in 1995/96.
But it did not repeat the 20-percent forecast in its annual report last month, creating some doubt about the outlook.
Murdoch also said he had no plans to buy out John Fairfax Holdings, which publishes the major broadsheet newspapers in Sydney and Melbourne and is News' major competitor in newspapers.
But he said Australian-based rival mogul Kerry Packer was also unlikely to bid for Fairfax any time soon if current goverment restrictions were lifted.
""I don't want to buy Fairfax. I don't believe Mr (Kerry) Packer wants to buy Fairfax,"" he said.
""To my knowledge he (Packer) has three times tried to sell his shares within the last 12 months. He'd like to influence and have the power of Fairfax but he's too shrewd to be paying for Fairfax at today's price.""
Murdoch also criticised the conservative government of Australian prime minister John Howard for not implementing radical economic reforms immediately.

2237,"National Mutual Holdings Ltd managing director Geoff Tomlinson said on Thursday that strong investment markets meant group earnings for the 1996/97 year were likely to be in line with the July prospectus forecasts.
""It's been a very kind year. I can't think of when the markets have been more conducive to our type of business,"" Tomlinson told Reuters in an interview.  
He said he could not give a formal forecast of the profit result for the just completed year to September 30 but an examination of the assumptions in National Mutual's share offer document would show the forecasts were likely to be met.
""You can go back and look at the investment assumptions in the share offer document and compare them with where we were at the end of September and we were in the fortunate position where most of the markets finished in line with predictions,"" he said.
""That would give you some underlying view that it's likely that our performance will be in line with that projection.""  
National Mutual forecast in its offer document a consolidated net profit after tax of A$198 million for the year ending September 30, up from A$115.5 million in 1994/95.
The assumptions underlying the forecast included an Australian 90 day bill rate of 7.5 percent as at September 30, a 10-year bond rate of 8.75 percent at September 30 and a U.S. 10 year bond rate of 6.50 percent as at September 30.
The offer document, issued before National Mutual demutualised and listed on the Australian Stock Exchange last month, said its profit was not significantly sensitive to its stock market assumptions.

2251,"Some Chinese traders are moving to take advantage of a sharp rally in world copper prices by selling the red metal back to the market, Far East metal industry sources said on Wednesday.
A rise in copper stocks held in London Metal Exchange (LME) warehouses in Singapore was attributed in part by some trading sources to Chinese selling.
""With such high LME prices, I believe some (copper) will be brought out of China,"" a Singapore trader said.  
He said stocks in Singapore rose 5,000 to 6,000 tonnes late last week -- after hovering at extremely low levels for the past couple of months -- as Chinese buyers sold material recently taken from LME warehouses elsewhere.
Asian traders have said China is adding substantial tonnages -- up to 300,000 tonnes -- to its central stockpile, with a third of that amount now passing through customs in Shanghai.
These reports have helped fuel a rally in three-month LME copper, which has climbed almost 20 percent in recent weeks on tight physical supply.  
Three-month LME metal hit a five-month high of $2,232 a tonne on Tuesday, up from $1,900 at the end of October.
Whether or not the copper now in China has completed customs formalities is not an issue, sources said.
""This is the government, they do what they like,"" said one.
There was a feeling, however, that Chinese government departments, mired in bureaucratic red tape, would be unable to move fast enough to take advantage of rapid market movements.
This would be the province of minor trading companies using hot money to buy small lots for speculative purposes.  
At least one Asian trader reported small parcel offerings from Chinese companies wanting to pick up between $200-$300 a tonne in profit.
Prices are at their highest since June 14 when Japan's Sumitomo Corp announced that one of its copper traders had wracked up losses in unauthorised deals now said by the company to be US$2.6 billion.
Reports from Europe last week of a hidden hoard of 600,000 tonnes of copper in Rotterdam were shot down by Asian traders.  
Tight global supply is now driving prices, with LME copper stocks below 100,000 tonnes for the first time since 1990 and representing less than a month's demand.
Traders in the Far East, polled in recent days, told Reuters this fundamental shift in the world supply/demand picture should keep prices buoyed at least in the short term.
""It's a volatile market and it is impossible to know what is going to happen,"" a South American source said.
""Is it going to stay over $1/lb next year? Absolutely, I have no doubt about that. It won't be for a couple of days, I'm talking for maybe a quarter and I think it will then stay there.  
""Why? Consumption. Don't forget consumption. It is much more important than people think. The fundamentals really call for a higher price,"" he said.
Shanghai and surrounding areas alone use upwards of 45,000 tonnes of copper a month, a European source in Hong Kong said.
But physical copper on the Shanghai Metal Exchange has also been tight as traders there liquidate their positions on the rising LME prices.
""Prices have gone up so fast it is a little bit hard to digest,"" a trader in Shanghai said.
""It could be beneficial to export,"" she said.  
""On the other hand, anyone who wanted to buy could be afraid the price will start to go the other way. It's close to year-end, book-squaring time, so everyone will want to sit back and wait.""

2252,"China has agreed not to enforce a ban on imports of U.S. poultry until after top-level quarantine talks scheduled to take place in Beijing next week, U.S. business and diplomatic sources said on Tuesday.
""We understand they (the Chinese authorities) have not issued any letter to the field banning imports, and that they will not until discussions are held,"" a senior diplomat in Beijing said.
China last week confirmed a ban on imports of poultry and poultry products from 10 U.S. states because of fears of a fowl plague known as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).
China is the second biggest market in the world, after Russia, for U.S. poultry products and is its only market for chicken feet.
U.S. poultry exports to China in 1995 totalled US$445 million, according to the U.S. Poultry and Egg Export Council. The states affected are Arkansas, Florida, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Texas, Utah and Wisconsin.
A two-man delegation from Washington's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) would arrive in Beijing on Monday for talks with China's Administration of Animal and Plant Quarantine (CAPQ) on Wednesday, the diplomatic source said.
""We have been told they will hold off on any action until then,"" he said of the ban.
News of the ban surfaced on October 10, when the U.S. agriculture attache in Beijing confirmed to his head office that China feared U.S. poultry products bore the HPAI virus.
U.S. officials say U.S. poultry is free of HPAI virus and that Chinese quarantine personnel are confused about the difference between HPAI and avian influenza, or AI.
""We don't know what they identified,"" an APHIS official told Reuters.
""All we can say is that HPAI is not found in the U.S. The last time it was found (in 1984) it was eradicated and since then we have had no reports of HPAI at all.""
AI is prevalent the world over, especially in wild fowl, and had not been isolated in commercial U.S. poultry flocks, he and other U.S. sources said.
""AI is not a concern for vets -- it's like the common cold and is not quarantinable,"" the APHIS source said.
U.S. and meat industry sources said the HPAI virus had been detected in ostrich breeding stock in the United States destined for ostrich farms in China.
During a trip to Texas by CAPQ personnel to look at U.S. ostriches, 22 birds had tested positive for HPAI, a U.S. source said.
A positive test did not necessarily mean the bird was ill with HPAI, he said, likening it to a tuberculosis skin test which, if positive, did not indicate definitively the presence of TB.

2253,"Falling world metal prices have spooked Asian aluminium traders who said on Monday up to 80,000 tonnes of the metal was sitting in Chinese ports, having been ordered by consumers who now want to pay the lower prices.
""A lot of people have aluminium stuck in China,"" a trader based in Hong Kong with a European firm said.
""There's more than 80,000 tonnes that I know of,"" he said.
Another industry source in Hong Kong said 35,000 to 40,000 tonnes of aluminium was stuck in Hong Kong and the nearby south Chinese port of Shantou, having been destined for Chinese end-users who refused to pay for it.
Chinese trading companies have earned poor reputations in recent years for reneging on deals when world prices of the commodity they are buying fall between the date the order was placed and the date of its arrival.
Metal traders in Hong Kong and Beijing said they had been waiting for news of distressed cargoes as they watched prices fall.
Another trading source said figures of up to 80,000 tonnes of distressed aluminium were believable given the amount in Hong Kong and Shantou, as material was also being shipped to other ports such as Shanghai and Tianjin.
""People will stop selling to China until the price goes up again,"" he said. ""And the price won't move up again until the LME (London Metal Exchange) stocks fall. There's just too much there.""
On top of this has been a general slowdown in metals business to China, traders said. None polled by Reuters saw business improving before the end of 1996.
Latest LME figures show aluminium stocks at 961,450 tonnes. The LME's aluminium price has been hitting long-term lows in recent trading weeks.
Prices picked up from 2-1/2-year lows on Friday as news emerged that some Russian smelters were considering cutting production.
LME three-months aluminium ended at US$1,337 a tonne, not much different from Thursday but firmer than before the news and somewhat above a low hit on Thursday of $1,305.
A year ago, the price was $1,742.
""Some people are forecasting the price will move to $1,250,"" another Hong Kong trader said. But he added: ""There is good support at the $1,300 level.""
LME warehouses in Singapore had plenty of metal, he said, but it was commanding a premium over the LME cash price of $30 to $40, and ocean freight rates to China were $65 a tonne.
""This is the main problem -- no trader can afford it. No one can afford it,"" he said.
Chinese consumers were mostly buying hand-to-mouth, waiting for prices to reach rock-bottom, traders said.
""Once the price starts to move up again they will buy, because they will see the bottom has been hit,"" the European trader said.
Traders said world metals markets would probably spend the fourth quarter of 1996 defining a direction for 1997, when fundamentals should begin to play a role in firming the price.

2255,"Around 300,000 tonnes of copper is in the process of being added to the stocks of China's central reserve authorities with about a third of that quantity now clearing through customs, Asian traders said on Monday.
Metals trading and industry sources polled in recent days by Reuters generally agreed that Shanghai bonded warehouses have held up to 100,000 tonnes of copper.
""The copper in the Shanghai (bonded) warehouses has been settled and is moving into China,"" a Chinese metals trader said.  
The copper's ownership and purpose have been contentious since it was channelled into China in the wake of Japanese Sumitomo Corp's revelation in June of massive copper-trading losses now said by the company to total US$2.6 billion.
Many market and industry sources have said the copper was bought by Beijing's metals trading arm China National Non-ferrous Metals Import/Export Corp (CNIEC) possibily in conjunction with Sumitomo.
Neither CNIEC nor Sumitomo have made any official comment.  
A Chinese source, who trades for a state-owned company, said central authorities bought the copper now moving through customs to cover the 85,000 tonnes of the red metal lent to the market in March 1995 and which had to be taken back.
But a European trader in Beijing said the 85,000 tonnes was additional to the tonnages now undergoing customs formalities.
He also noted the earlier movement of between 40,000 to 50,000 tonnes of copper which was shipped from Shanghai to bonded warehouses in north China for the state reserve.  
Another 50,000-60,000 tonnes had been taken from London Metal Exchange (LME) warehouses and would be delivered to Chinese ports in January or early February, he said.
The European source's total figure of 285,000-295,000 tonnes tallies with reports from other sources, Western and Chinese, who have said China, either through major state-owned trading companies or smaller firms with hot money, is due to take delivery of substantial amounts of copper.
As the London Metal Exchange (LME) copper price plummeted in June on Sumitomo's news, China was said to be taking advantage of prices below $2,000 a tonne to stock up.  
Arbitrage opportunities are narrowing, however, and trade sources said they were relieved the Shanghai hoard was destined for central government reserves.
""This will keep it off the market,"" a Shanghai trader said.
The European source in Beijing said: ""These tonnages are worth US$1 billion and only the central reserve authorities have the capacity to put out this sort of money.
""It could even be part of the Three Gorges Dam budget -- that project could easily use 100,000 tonnes of copper and the reserve's stocks are very low,"" he said.  
A large gap between LME and Shanghai Metal Exchange prices gave Chinese arbitragers a stab at healthy profits and a chance to take their money out of domestic equities.
This fuelled fears that massive amounts of copper could be channeled onto the domestic Chinese market.
A South American source who regularly visits Chinese copper smelters said many of his contacts had recently expressed fears that 300,000 tonnes of copper would soon arrive in China and kill the market for domestic product.  
Beijing's plan to dam the Yangtse River is one of the world's biggest infrastructure projects, costing around $30 billion and due for completion in 2009.
Five different departments of Shanghai Customs contacted by Reuters said they did not know of the copper movements.
A number of government departments, as well as Beijing's metals production arm China National Non-ferrous Metals Corp (CNNC) and CNIEC also said they were not aware of or had no comment on the market talk.
China is traditionally guarded about its reserves, treating all relevant figures as a state secret.  
Copper futures on the Shanghai Metal Exchange breached the key resistance level of 20,000 yuan ($2,409) per tonne in early Monday trading, after sharp gains on the LME on Friday.
LME copper rode a roller-coaster on Friday, finally settling at $2,148 a tonne, a gain of $117 over Thursday as the market shook off rumours of huge stocks held in Rotterdam and focused on the lowest LME copper stocks in 6-1/4 years.

2256,"Casualties are starting to mount as Chinese buyers of soybeans and soybean meal default or cancel contracts in the wake of falling international prices, Asian trading sources said on Thursday.
""We have stopped doing Chinese business for now,"" said a trader in Hong Kong with a major international house.
""We're waiting for the market to stabilise and are staying away from the possibility of defaults,"" he said.
Traders in Hong Kong, Singapore and China reported hearing of Chinese soymeal buyers delaying finance arrangements for orders in an attempt to force sellers to lower their prices.
Another Hong Kong source reported that Chinese buyers had defaulted on three to four cargoes, each of 50,000 tonnes, since last week when international prices began to fall.
""They are defaulting because PRC buyers delayed opening LCs (letters of credit) in the hope of squeezing another two or three dollars from their sellers,"" he said.
Traders have said these tactics are next to useless as physical soymeal for prompt delivery is tight, and would command a premium that would wipe out any extra profit.
Since entering the international trading arena earlier this decade, Chinese traders have earned themselves a reputation for dubious practices when it comes to paying for their orders.
In some cases, traders have reported, a Chinese buyer will default on or cancel an order for a commodity if the price falls after the order is placed and before it is delivered.
The Chinese company will then attempt to replace the commodity at the cheaper rate.
As a result, when prices of a commodity that is a hot item in China begin to fall, some international traders simply exit the market.
Others insist on deposits, and others grade Chinese traders according to their record of paying up and charge higher premiums accordingly.
Soybean meal has been the hot Chinese commodity of 1996, traders said, with arrivals from South America around 1.2 million tonnes since February.
Traders said maximum Chinese orders of U.S. meal in the past two weeks were 300,000 tonnes.
One trader claiming to have done 400,000 tonnes of beans and meal business in the past two weeks said he had letters of credit from his buyers for 350,000 tonnes.
His sales would show up in U.S. Department of Agriculture figures this week, he said.
The price of soybean meal on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) has been on a rollercoaster ride since late September, and initially dipped while China was on holiday from September 30 to October 3 celebrating National Day.
On October 4, Chinese buyers scooped up more than 600,000 tonnes of beans and meal, mostly of U.S. origin, some South American, paying $300 to $310 a tonne, traders said.
But last Friday, prices started to fall again, by Tuesday coming off another $10 or so a tonne -- and word of Chinese cancellations and defaults began to circle.
Reports from Chicago on Wednesday described the market as perplexed over rumours China had bought or cancelled export orders for U.S. and South American soybeans and soymeal.
CBOT October soymeal closed at $236.30 a tonne, after Tuesday's $235.30.

2274,"Copper stored in Shanghai warehouses -- the murky ownership of which has cast a pall of concern over the world market -- is being offered in small lots to European trading houses, industry sources said on Thursday.
The copper is been offered for sale at a high premium in order to set a benchmark price for its eventual sale to China's strategic stockpile, one Chinese trader said.
Traders said that estimates of copper reserves brought into China in recent months range between 100,000 and 150,000 tonnes. A European trader in Beijing said he had been offered copper by the China National Non-ferrous Metals Import and Export Corp (CNIEC) at around $2,100 a tonne -- a level reflecting the London Metal Exchange (LME) cash price plus a premium of $130.
CNIEC has declined to comment on the market talk.
The copper was said to be owned by Chinese trading firms which had shipped it to Shanghai in the expectation that the central stockpile would buy this amount to square its position on metal previously lent to the market, before the end of 1996. ""They are hoping that it is the right tonnage in the right place, but as far as we know, the stockpile has so far not confirmed they will buy it,"" a Chinese trader with a state-owned Chinese firm, said.
Traders said last week the copper probably belonged to China's state reserve, which lent around 85,000 tonnes of copper, through CNIEC, onto the LME between April and June 1995.
In March this year, CNIEC's former president Fang Dachang said China was likely to take it back in the fourth quarter.
But when copper began to move back to China in June and July, from LME warehouses in Rotterdam, Singapore and Long Beach, California traders assumed the central reserve was taking the copper back earlier than planned.
Not so, said the Chinese trader, though he added: ""Who owns it is anyone's guess.""
The metal was taken from LME warehouses at about $2,400 a tonne, a Hong Kong trader said, with the price set before three month LME copper prices slid below $1,800 on news in June of $1.8 billion in copper trading losses by Japan's Sumitomo Corp.
Three month copper was indicated at $1,942/45 a tonne in late LME trade on Wednesday.
""It (the copper) has been sitting there for a couple of months, so someone has to pick up the loss,"" a trader said.
""Whether the stockpile takes this tonnage from this owner, or if they buy it themselves and arrange another shipment themselves, is up to them,"" the Chinese trader said.
""But it depends on the price. If they (the stockpile) can get a premium lower than $100, maybe they will take it. They won't pay $150, or $120, especially on this sort of tonnage.""
A trader in Shanghai said CNIEC would ""dearly love someone to take the whole lot, but that is unrealistic"".
But the Chinese source said: ""This copper can only be taken by the stockpile"" because no other buyer could afford it.
China levies a three percent import duty and a 17 percent value-added tax on copper imports, which traders said made it prohibitively expensive.
Freight, warehousing and other costs would put the Shanghai copper in the same cost bracket as copper shipped to the region from LME warehouses in Europe or the Americas if the premiums being asked were paid, traders said.
Other traders, in Asia and in Europe, have told Reuters that CNIEC had offered them copper in a series of secret meetings held in major Chinese cities since June.
About 40,000 tonnes was said by traders in China to have been shipped already to warehouses near the northern port of Yingkou, where the strategic stockpile has some warehouses. This has not been confirmed.
Another 20,000 tonnes of copper was stored in Shanghai Metal Exchange warehouses in the eastern port city, and the remainder of the metal was in other Shanghai stores, traders said.
""The whole market is still being manipulated by somebody,"" a Chinese source said. ""The game is not over.""

2278,"Chile, the world's biggest copper exporter, hopes to forge close trade and technical support ties with China, the world's biggest copper importer, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Mariano Fernandez said.
""There is Chinese interest in participating in some mining projects in Chile, and we have an interest in participating in service and technology in copper mining in China,"" Fernandez told Reuters in a recent interview.
Of Chile's total 1995 mining exports worth US$7.85 billion, $280 million was earned from selling copper to China, he said.
""It is not only potential ... this is reality,"" he said. ""If we look ahead, there are some forecasts that in five years we will produce almost one-third of the world's total copper.
""But looking at 1.2 billion (Chinese) people and the rush for development in China, we should not exclude China as a very important client for Chilean copper.""
Chile, with 25 percent of world copper reserves, mined 2.512 million tonnes of the red metal in 1995, far ahead of its closest rival the United States, with 1.8 million, and fifth placed China with 435,000 tonnes, Chilean figures show.
Copper accounted for 36.4 percent of Chile's total exports in 1995 of $16.5 billion, the figures show.
China's 1996 demand for copper has been officially put at one million tonnes.
Its copper imports for 1996 were expected to be 200,000 tonnes, the president of China Non-ferrous Metals Industry Corp, Wu Jianchang, said in May.
Trade and industry sources have speculated recently about China's interest in buying copper properties in Chile, along similar lines to recent investment by major Chinese corporations in Peru's iron ore industry.
But one source with a major regional producer said the high price of Chilean copper mines, combined with a cash squeeze in China and the poor international reputation of Chinese buyers, would keep Chilean producers reluctant to forge long-term ties.
""I don't see China guaranteeing long-term supply contracts,"" the industry executive, based in Hong Kong, said.
""It is not the way they work because if the prices fall, they are then very reluctant to pay,"" he said. He was referring to the practice of some Chinese importers of refusing to pay for commodities if the price falls between order and delivery.
Fernandez did not elaborate on the details of cooperation Chile was hoping for with China. ""We are at the beginning (of discussions),"" he said.
He was in Hong Kong after a four-day trip to Beijing where he met with senior Chinese officials, including Minister for Foreign Affairs Qian Qichen and Minister for Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi.
The purpose of his visit was to lay the groundwork for a visit to Chile on November 6 and 7 by Chinese Premier Li Peng, he said.
Fernandez said he asked Chinese officials to consider recognising Chile as free of Mediterranean fruit fly, as Japan had already done, and free of foot-and-mouth disease.
""The Chilean dream is to sell one apple, one bunch of grapes and one bottle of wine a year to every Chinese person,"" he said.

2292,"China has emerged from the cocoon of last week's National Day celebrations to swoop on the world's soybean and soymeal markets, snapping up a total of between 600,000 and 800,000 tonnes, traders said on Tuesday.
One trader in the region took the credit for a full half of 800,000 tonnes of beans and meal business that he said had been done with Chinese buyers in the past four trading days.
""There has been a chunk of business going on,"" he said.
""I guess total meal and beans done since last Wednesday is 800,000 tonnes, with 200,000 to 300,000 of it beans and 500,000 to 600,000 tonnes of it meal,"" he said.
Chinese buyers jumped into the market as soon as the National Day holiday was over, he said, expressing his surprise at how fast the usually cautious Chinese reacted to price falls.
China celebrated the 47th anniversary of the founding of the communist-ruled People's Republic on October 1 with an extended public holiday that saw government, business and trade closed for three weekdays last Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.
During that time, soy product prices fell significantly on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) on trade concerns that the U.S. crop would be higher than previously thought.
Talk of Chinese interest has helped CBOT values move up a little in the past week.
Reports that China last week bought between 120,000 and 150,000 tonnes of soymeal for November/December delivery from the United States, South America and India helped propel CBOT soy product futures higher on Monday. Soymeal was $2.10 per tonne higher to $0.10 lower, with October up $2.10 at $246.20 a tonne.
The price falls coincided with one of China's peak buying periods for soybeans, soybean meal and vegetable oil.
The regional trading source claiming half the recent business as his own said he sold meal at $300 c&amp;f (cost and freight) and beans at $5 to $10 a tonne above that.
The soybeans were of U.S. origin, he said, meal spread between the United States and South America. Shipments would begin in October/November for December/January arrival.
Buyers were numerous, he said, and all the purchases were for consumption.
While the other half of the business could not be immediately confirmed, one other Asian trader said he believed a total of 600,000 tonnes of beans and meal business had been done with China since the National Day break.
Chinese buyers were looking for low protein meal at $290 a tonne, and beans at between $290 and $300 a tonne, he said.
""I don't think this price will fly, but as usual PRC buyers start off low and see how low they can get it,"" he said.
Meal business concluded since last Wednesday was 400,000 to 500,000 tonnes, he said, with beans 100,000 to 200,000 tonnes.
Competitive freight rates in a tight market were helping keep c&amp;f values down, trading sources said, adding vessels could be found at $18 to $20 a tonne from the United States to China.
China had been expected to buy up to 500,000 tonnes of soybeans before December, and up to 400,000 tonnes after March 1997, a Chinese trader said.
""That's to make sure they have enough in stock before new-crop meal comes into the market, which will be January at the earliest. And then enough in stock before Chinese New Year (in February 1997),"" he said.
""So we're right on target,"" he said.

The Chinese government banned all imports of poultry and poultry products from 10 U.S. states earlier this month for fear it carried a virus called highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).
Although the ban has yet to be implemented -- China wanted to hear what the U.S. experts had to say first -- it threatens an export market worth around US$500 million a year.

The meetings are between Washington's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and China's Administration of Animal and Plant Quarantine (CAPQ).
Two APHIS experts arrived in Beijing on Tuesday night and would stay in Beijing for as long as it took to solve the problem, the U.S. source said.
""There is no timetable,"" the source close to the talks said. ""We are willing to take as much time as is needed in order to make sure the Chinese have as much information as they can to make an informed decision based on good science.""
Meetings had already been scheduled for Thursday and would, if necessary, continue on Friday, he added.
APHIS experts, U.S. diplomats and meat industry executives say HPAI does not exist in commerical flocks in the United States, having been eradicated in the mid-1980s.
U.S. sources have said Chinese quarantine officials seem to have confused HPAI with the less-virulent avian influenza, or AI, which one APHIS source likened to the common cold.
Sources have said CAPQ officials would be joined by experts from other government departments for what sounded like a series of lectures and presentations by the APHIS team.
The U.S. source in Beijing said the Chinese had so far been receptive and were taking a ""very positive approach"".
U.S. sources said the plan was to concentrate initially on the technical side of the dispute before raising trade issues.
If the dispute goes beyond the differences the two countries have in interpreting science, Beijing could find itself accused of using bad science as a non-tariff trade barrier.
This is the case with wheat. China refuses to import wheat from specific areas of the United States because it cannot be guaranteed free of a fungus called TCK smut.
Washington says the fungus is harmless and that Beijing's policy of zero tolerance is a barrier to an extra 500,000 tonnes of U.S. wheat sales a year to China.

2299,"Chinese importers are expected to make incremental use of import quotas for 1.3 million tonnes of palm oil to avoid driving up the world price and pushing down the domestic price, Far East traders said on Friday.
China still has significant stocks of edible oil -- reported in official media to be 2.8 million tonnes by the end of October 1995 -- which could even keep China out of the palm oil market until early 1997, traders said.
A flurry in Malaysian palm oil futures prices on Friday, as speculators reacted to news the Chinese government had approved imports of 1.3 million tonnes of palm oil, was a knee-jerk reaction, trading sources around the region said.
""This is just panic short-covering and speculative interest,"" a Singapore trader said.
""People are just looking at the volume of 1.3 million tonnes, they are not looking at the market reality,"" he said.
Import licences could be extended, said another trader, as those issued in 1995 had been for six months.
""This is just the normal annual allocation,"" he said. ""Unless China buys a couple of hundred thousand tonnes a month, there is no justification for a market move, this is just on the news.
""People have been talking about it for a month or more. There is no need (for China) to hurry,"" he said.
Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik said on Thursday China had approved imports of 1.3 million tonnes of palm oil between August 1996 and March 1997.
Malaysia would provide 80 percent of China's palm oil, Lim said, with the remainder coming from Indonesia.
At midday, the benchmark third position November crude palm oil futures contract was up 20 ringgit to 1,180 riggit (US$473.33) a tonne. Among refined products, November/December RBD palm olein was traded at $550 a tonne FOB Malaysia.
Traders said domestic Chinese palm oil prices were around 6,500 yuan ($783) a tonne.
Using the November/December bulk palm olein FOB Malaysia price as a benchmark, traders said importing did not make economical sense for China as costs, freight, insurance, and import and value-added taxes would push the price up to 7,552 yuan ($910) a tonne.
""They are not likely to use the quotas straight away,"" another trader said.
Annual per capita consumption of edible oil in China is six kg (13.2 lb), compared with the average 16 kg (35.2 lb) in developed countries.
Traders said China had been importing about 100,000 tonnes a month of palm oil, mostly as bulk palm olein, up to June.
Palm olein is used by the food industry for manufacture of ice cream and cakes; palm oil is used for frying in the production of instant noodles.
Customs figures released this week show China's edible oil imports, including palm oil, in the first seven months of 1996 were 1.74 million tonnes, down 26.9 percent from the same period in 1995. July vegetable imports were nil, the figures show.
Palm oil imports for the first seven months of 1996 totalled 582,000 tonnes, trading sources said, down 40 percent on the same 1995 period.
Overbuying in 1995 was still hanging over the market, traders said. Some sources have predicted that current vegetable oil stocks could last until the end of 1996, and they point to soft domestic prices as proof.
Indeed, prices indicated in Shanghai on Wednesday showed vegetable oil prices falling to as low as 6,700 yuan ($807) a tonne, from 7,000 ($843) a tonne two weeks ago.
Soyoil fell to 7,200 a tonne, from around 7,500 two weeks ago, according to figures from the National Grains and Oils Information Centre.

2302,"Stagecoach, the British bus and rail group which has seen its shareprice grow fivefold in three years, saw its stock hit a record high on Thursday after posting a bumper 127 percent rise in first half profits.
The Scottish-based group which has enjoyed explosive growth since its flotation in 1993, said half year pre-tax profits climbed to a record 47 million pounds ($79 million). The half year dividend rose 43 percent to three pence a share and group turnover leapt to 405 million pounds from 198.8 million.
Chairman Brian Souter called the results excellent.
Shares in Stagecoach were up 45.5 pence at 629 by 1350 GMT, leading a fleet of other bus companies higher in its wake. Go-Ahead Group rose 15 pence to 411.5 and Cowie Group added 5.5 pence to 396p.
""It's good news all round. The profits are two million above what I expected. We're upgrading our year forecast by five million to 97 million pounds,"" said UBS analyst Richard Hannah.
The results were the first since the group's high profile acquisitions of British rail rolling stock company Porterbrook and the Swedish bus group Swebus.
""The integration of Porterbrook and Swebus is proceeding and I am confident of a successful outcome,"" said Souter.
Porterbook and the bus operations were the real driver behind the growth in profits. The figures were also flattered by a one-off gain of 15 million pounds from the sale of a 21.7 percent stake in Strathclyde Buses. This was reflected in the high half year payout.
Porterbook's profits were better than expected at 13.5 million pounds in the six weeks since it was acquired.
""That's about two million profit a week on operating profit margins of 40 percent,"" said Hannah.
Stagecoach finance director Keith Cochrane said operating profits would ease slightly in the latter part of the year as the company took on ""on-going expenditure for maintenance"".
He forecast Porterbrook would still perform strongly, although margins would not be as high as in the first six weeks.
Total sales in the bus operation rose to 232.2 million pounds against 189.2 million, yielding profits of 34.6 million versus 29.0 million.
South West Trains, a new business, saw sales of 128 million pounds and profits of 500,000 pounds.
Porterbrook sales were 33.6 million pounds, with 13.5 million profit and Swebus sales came in at 11.3 million, with 600,000 pounds in profit.
Stagecoach, which started out as a brother and sister team in Scotland, was floated in 1993 at 112 pence a share. The share price has doubled this year. ($1=.5956 Pound)

2307,"Britain's fraud watchdog, the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) on Wednesday launched an investigation into former bosses of Wickes Plc, the do-it-yourself retailer rocked by accounting irregularities worth tens of millions of pounds.
""The SFO has launched an investigation into the former senior management of Wickes,"" an SFO spokesman told Reuters.
It said the probe was being carried out jointly with the British police fraud squad in London.
Investigators are now expected to interview the ex-chairman and chief executive Henry Sweetbaum who resigned from the group in the summer, former finance director Trefor Llewellyn who is now at Caradon Plc, and the former buying and commercial directors.
""No-one has been arrested or charged and we have not executed any search warrants,"" the SFO spokesman said, adding that it had taken on the case on November 20 but had not announced its involvement ""for operational reasons"".
Wickes uncovered the accounting scam in June. The discrepencies date back five years and led to a 51 million pound ($85.62 million) overstatement of profits which will be wiped off shareholder funds.
The news led to a boardroom shake-up last summer and a three and a half month internal inquiry by accountants Price Waterhouse and law firm Linklaters &amp; Paine.
""These investigations have led to the SFO having the reasonable grounds it requires to be able to launch a criminal investigation,"" said the SFO spokesman.
Meanwhile, Wickes is trying to salvage its business which was shaken by the summer's events.
Its shares remain frozen at 69 pence per share and it is planning to restate profits next month and launch details of a refinancing rights issue of between 30 and 40 million pounds.
A Wickes spokesman told Reuters those plans were ""well advanced."" It is also close to deciding on a new chief executive, with two to three candidates shortlisted including an internal candidate.
The former chief Sweetbaum said last month that he accepted ""ultimate responsibility"" for what happened under his regime.
He has agreed to repay his 1.2 million pounds in bonuses including tax. former finance chief Llewellyn has also agreed to repay his bonus of 485,000 pounds for 1995.
Moves to refinance the group will help cut gearing to around 70 percent said analysts, who believe it will be far from easy to raise the rights issue cash needed to put the company back on the road to recovery.

2310,"Debt-laden Eurotunnel is awaiting the outcome of insurer investigations into the costs of the major fire aboard a freight train last week.
Lead insurer Union des Assurances De Paris (UAP) said on Tuesday it was ""impossible to quantify yet the cost of the damage.""
""Up to now, there is no reliable estimate of the amount of damage caused by the fire on November 18 in the south tunnel,"" it said, adding its maximum residual risk was 75 million francs ($14.4 million).
Eurotunnel said in a statement earlier that it will hold a press conference to update the situation on Wednesday.
The beleaguered tunnel operator also said the investigating judge had finished his inspection of the scene of the blaze, but insurers and company engineers were continuing to investigate.
The latest statements were made amid rife speculation on the cost of the fire, including unconfirmed reports of total insured costs of as much as 200 million pounds ($334 million).
Current restrictions caused by fire damage are costing the group a million pounds in lost revenue every day.
Eurotunnel was also hit this week by reports of possible claims from companies operating the Eurostar high-speed train service which runs through the tunnel.
Eurostar's British owners, the London and Continental Railways consortium, said there were provisions in its contract with Eurotunnel for reduced access charges if the tunnel was partially or fully closed.
Eurotunnel's spokeswoman said reduced access meant Eurostar (and possibly its French and Belgian counterparts) could see ""a reduction to their payment.""
She reiterated that Eurotunnel is fully insured.
""The insurance should cover loss of business, the rolling stock, damage to the tunnel, compensation,"" she said.
The company declined to comment further at this stage.
One source close to Eurotunnel said last week that the cost of fire damage alone to freight and to the tunnel could run to tens of millions of pounds.
""The cost will be millions (of pounds) and could get into double figures, if you consider the damage to the 15 wagons and a locomotive, plus severe tunnel damage,"" said the source.
The cost of replacing a whole train was estimated at around 25 million pounds.
A senior source close to Eurotunnel insurers told Reuters on Tuesday that the cost of replacing rolling stock could be ""in the range of mid- to late-teens (of millions of pounds).""
Adding to uncertainty surrounding insurance cover was the possibility that any payout could be affected by suggestions that the train was on fire before entering the tunnel.
However, analysts seem confident the costs would be covered.
But some said the level of losses caused by the fire were belittled by the scale of Eurotunnel's total debts.
""In relation to Eurotunnel's other financial problem of 8.8 billion (pounds) in debt anything else is incidental, even if the fire cost is 200 million at worst,"" one analyst said.
Since the fire, Eurotunnel's shares have fallen from a close of 91-1/2 pence on November 18 before the fire broke out to 77-1/2 by the close on Tuesday. ($1=5.190 French Franc) ($1=.5990 Pound)

2312,"Imperial Tobacco Group will split from conglomerate Hanson Plc on October 1 as one of the most efficient players in its sector, but while the new chief talks of export-led growth, the outlook is clouded by the threat of litigation against tobacco firms.
Imperial is Britain's second biggest tobacco firm after B.A.T Industries and its brands include Embassy, John Player Special and Superkings cigarettes as well as Panama and Castella cigars.
It is one of four arms of the mighty Hanson conglomerate being spun off into separate floated companies to unlock value.
In the ten years since Hanson took over Imperial, it has slashed costs, cut its brands to 33 from 150 and raised productivity by 195 percent. 1995 profits were 348 million pounds on 3.6 billion of sales.
But analysts fear that despite Imperial's impressive track record, marking it as the comeback kid of the tobbaco industry, its shares could face a rough ride once listed in London.
This week saw tobacco stocks hit by a backlash in the United States, with fresh litigation plus tough new curbs from U.S. President Bill Clinton to regulate the industry.
So far, BAT Industries has borne the brunt. But some analysts believe it is only a matter of time before the U.S. scenario widens its impact and is repeated across the Atlantic.
""If it happens in the U.S. it's subsequently followed in other countries,"" said Zafar Khan, analyst at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull.
""Imperial could have been a ripe international takeover candidate. But the litigation threat means a group buying a tobacco company would have a tough time selling the idea to shareholders now,"" he said.
UBS analysts agree that the threat of legal action is enough to dampen the company's outlook.
But they warn of another possible dampener on the stock when Imperial starts trading - its heavy reliance on Britain, largely seen as a mature market. Britain accounts for 87 percent of profits, say analysts.
Imperial has already committed itself to overseas expansion, but there are fears that it will have a tough time muscling in on the U.S. giants which have already made inroads into the markets of tomorrow - India, China and the Far East.
""We see investor concerns on litigation risk combined with the uncertain outlook in the key UK market as implying a 20-30 percent PE (price earnings) discount to the UK average."" This assumes a prospective PE of 9.9 times, UBS said in a note.
It has given Hanson a total break-up value of 164 pence, in a market range of 150 to 200 pence per share. Hanson shares were down 2 1/2 pence at 159 1/2 by 1033 GMT Friday.
UBS specifically values the Imperial constituent at 39 pence per share or 2.03 billion pounds ($3.14 billion).
However, another investment analyst who declined to be named, said he was more upbeat on Imperial's prospects.
""It's a clean business. It could become a takeover target and it's also very cash generative,"" he said.
He values Imperial at 37 pence in a total Hanson break-up valuation of 187 pence per share.
There is some upside to the Imperial story. Apart from being viewed as a highly efficient player and being the second biggest UK tobacco company with 38 percent of the market, it is also poised to try and tap the vast emerging markets.
Gareth Davis (corrects from Nigel Davis), Imperial's chief executive who joined the company straight from university, told the London-based Evening Standard newspaper earlier this week that he believed the group would continue to build up exports to Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.
""Worldwide this industry is buoyant,"" he said.
Imperial has said in earlier mission statements that it will expand abroad through ""organic growth and acquisition.""
But with 1.1 billion pounds in debt as part of its Hanson inheritance, industry watchers wonder just how it will finance its much needed expansion. ($1=.6458 Pound)

2322,"Japanese car giant Nissan Motor Co is expected to make a decision on whether to go ahead with building a new medium-sized vehicle for the European market in spring 1997, according to the head of its UK operations.
Ian Gibson, managing director of Nissan Motor UK and vice-president of Nissan Europe, said in an interview with Reuters he would be presenting his plan to the Nissan board in Tokyo next spring.
But he added that the investment size, design details and production were yet to be thrashed out. Gibson said it was still an open verdict on whether the plan would go ahead.
Speaking from the British Internaitonal Motor Show in Birmingham, he said the new car would be between its small Micra and larger Primera, based on the Almeira model which is currently manufactured in Japan and shipped to Europe.
""If we build the car in Europe, the design and develoment is purely for a model destined for Europe, not one that has to include a number of viewpoints for world export.""
""We will do it from scratch if it goes ahead,"" said Gibson.
But he added that if the decision is given the go-ahead next year it would mean moving up to 100,000 units of capacity from Japan into Europe.
""The question is what opportunities are there for Japan to use that excess capacity for something else?""
Gibson said this was part of the equation in the decision but refused to outline what options the Japan headquarters were looking at in terms of ""new models and new markets.""
If Nissan does decide to build the new model in Europe it would be manufactured in the UK or Spain.
Gibson was circumspect about the cost of developing and putting the new model on sale, saying ""I can't see it happening for less than 200 million (stg). But that's the absolute minimum.
He refused to cite a top end figure, but separately spoke of the general industry cost of building and marketing a new vehicle, estimating it at between one and three billion stg.
On Nissan's European sales for 1996, Gibson said there would be a modest rise, predicting three percent sales growth for 1997.

2327,"Wickes Plc, the British Do-It-Yourself retailer rocked by accounting irregularities this summer, said on Wednesday the first cost was a 51 million pounds ($80.84 million) write-off for which its ex-chairman accepted responsibility.
The retailer said the problems had resulted in profits being overstated by 51 million pounds ($80.8 million) over recent years and that amount will be wiped off shareholder funds.
The restatement of the accounts will result in a reduction of 26 million pounds in operating profit for 1995, 14 million pounds for 1994 and 11 million pounds for earlier years.
Profits for 1995 will also be hit by a two million pounds charge against shareholder funds relating to European businesses and a 10 million pounds charge stemming from property interests.
But the cost does not end there. Finance director Bill Hoskins, brought in after the purge which saw former chairman and chief executive Henry Sweetbaum resign, told Reuters he expected another one-off charge against 1996 results.
This relates to restructuring and the costs of the investigation into the accounting problems uncovered in June. Hoskins told Reuters: ""Taking the two together, the cost won't be tens of millions, but around 10 million.""
The company will now undergo a refinancing rights issue. Hoskin said 30 million pounds would be ""a good starting point"" and be used to cut gearing (the debt-to-equity ratio) which remains ""pretty horrid.""
The new chairman Michael von Brentano said in a letter to shareholders his predecessor Sweetbaum accepted ""ultimate responsibility"" and would repay his 1.2 million pounds in bonus payments including tax.
Former finance director Trefor Llewellyn has agreed to repay his 485,000 pounds bonus for 1995.
The group is seeking a new chief executive and said it also intends to strengthen non-executive representation on its board.
Disciplinary action has been taken against two Wickes directors with responsibility for the buying department, both of whom have resigned. Further action against other middle ranking executives and more junior employees will be taken in due course, the company said.
Wickes will replace auditors Arthur Andersen once the work is completed on revisions, but it reserved the right to take action against it.
""I appreciate that much of what I have written will be very disappointing to you,"" von Brentano's letter said. ""But now my principal concern is to secure the company's future, define the appropriate cost base and reassert the group's market strengths,"" he said.
Hoskins also spoke of a new start, telling Reuters ""We want to make a clear distinction between the past and the future. It is essential that we draw a line in the sand.""
But the path to profitability still looks rocky. Nick Bubb, analyst at MeesPierson said there were two disappointments: ""The company is losing money this year, admittedly partly because of large exceptional items, and the fact that the debt is as high as it is at 65 million pounds - that is a big increase and I can see why a rights issue is needed.""
But he added that 30 million pounds was seen as the bare minimum. This would cut gearing to just 70 percent. ""It may need to raise as much as 40 or 50 million and that won't be easy,"" said Bubb.

2335,"Millennium Chemicals, to be spun off from the mighty Hanson conglomerate in an October flotation, has already had to rebuff would-be suitors, chief executive of the soon-to-be independent company said on Tuesday.
William Landuyt, who is also chairman of Millennium, also unveiled his strategic blueprint in an interview with Reuters, including plans for a share buyback by 2000 after cutting debt and implementing post-demerger investment plans.
Millennium had 1995 sales of two billion pounds ($3.12 billion) and profits of 588 million pounds.
""We are not a dividend yield stock. We are a growth company,"" Landuyt said, warning investors of a tight dividend policy.
The demerger of Hanson Plc will create four companies - Millennium, Imperial Tobacco, Energy Group and the rump building firm which will retain the famous Hanson name.
As investors await details of the float of the first two divisions - Millennium and Imperial - Landuyt said there had been takeover interest in all four companies including his own empire.
""We've had interest for every business in Hanson."" He said ""expressions of interest"" included those for whole divisions as well as individual companies within each of the four divisions to be floated off.
Millennium itself received approaches for all three of its units - Quantum, SCM and Glidco. All approaches were rebuffed.
Hanson's chemicals arm had been widely tipped as a takeover candidate by analysts in recent months, but Hanson's group share price recently took a hit after it was revealed that Millennium had built in a ""poison pill"" to deter predators.
The move led to a downgrading in the Hanson break-up value by analysts including BZW which pared back to 193 from 207 pence per share. The market valuation range spreads from 150 pence to 200 pence per share. Hanson's shares stand at 162 1/4, up 2 3/4 pence.
One analyst said of the poison pill episode ""It was quite disgusting. Here is a predatory company which has spoken out against such tactics and has installed a poison pill itself.""
But Landuyt said it was vital to prevent a predator buying up shares on the cheap and launching an undervalued bid.
""We do expect selling pressure (for Millennium shares) for at least the first six months. We don't want a temporary drop in the share price to allow someone to get a commanding position and launch a bid which does not offer full value.""
Under law in the U.S. state of Delaware, a company gaining a 15 percent stake in Millennium would see those shares become worthless. They would carry no vote or liquidation value unless the board had been approached first.
But the poison pill clause ends after one year, said the chemicals company chief, freeing the way for a possible bid.
Another factor which has damped Millennium's core valuation has been poor trading which has dogged the chemicals market leading to plant closures and asset writedowns of $60 million at SCM. Landuyt said that a further $15 million charge still had to be levied.
He said the impact on trading profits would be neutral and also said signs of an uptick remain.
He expected SCM to be able to make its October price increases stick after heavy destocking by customers.
Quantum's recently reported improvement in pricing and demand also continues, he said.

2336,"Imperial Tobacco Group Plc, fresh from its demerger from Hanson Plc in October, said on Monday it was capable of cutting back debt levels and investing in further export growth as a dual policy.
Gareth Davis, chief executive, told Reuters in an interview that the two could be achieved ""in parallel"" because of the group's strong cash generation. In particular, Davis revealed Imperial was in talks with a Japanese company about entering the market for the first time. He also said the group would keep open the option of a share buyback in the future.  
Imperial inherited around 1.1 billion stg of debt as its legacy from the Hanson family break-up. But Davis said this did not hamper the group's plans to seek distribution deals or joint ventures in the overseas cigarette markets and possibly examine small acquisition deals in the fragmented cigar market.
He added that if an important larger-sized acquisition opportunity came up he would be prepared to raise debt levels, but for the moment ""the priority is to get it down. Our situation, our ability to generate cash means we can do things in parallel - pay down debt and pay for acquisitions...Bolt-on acquisitions are more likely in the cigar area,"" he added.  
On the Japanese market in particular, Davis told Reuters ""We are looking to do something in Japan. We are actively considering this. In one way or another we will establish a presence in that market,"" admitting that talks were underway with one party.
But he sought to reassure shareholders that Imperial would not squander its sound financial inheritance in its bid to catch up in the overseas field. ""In our international expansion plans I would not dream of being a balance sheet wrecker,"" he said. If Imperial failed to find the right deals, it would be prepared to conside other options to return value, he said.  
If a possible acquisition fails to offer sufficient rates of return ""we would say: what would a share buyback do to enhance shareholder value, rather than a potential acquisition?""
""A buyback is something we'd never rule out. Given our cash flow characteristics people tend to say ""What are you going to do with all that cash.'""
Imperial reports its first set of results since the Hanson demerger on December 5 when it will give a trading update of the first few months since its split.
Davis said he expected the UK market to continue to decline at around 2 percent next year.  
But the international business, accounting for 17 percent of profits in the first eight months of the year, s expected to show continued rapid growth.
""I would be very disappointed if it wasn't 25 percent by 2,000."" The last two years have seen overseas sales double, but Davis drew the line at hitting his target by 1997.
""That would be overstating it (our confidence). But the signs are the business is showing strong growth.""
Despite his caution, Davis has said that the company has already clinched a deal with unions to add a third shift from May 1997 which has the potential to raise capacity at its Nottingham factory  by one third.
Imperial says if a number of overseas deals start feeding through it will be ready to meet the surge in demand.
The third shift could, in theory, raise Imperial's total cigarette production to 53 billion from the existing 37 billion mark.

2340,"Ecological warfare has broken out across the British construction industry, striking some of the biggest corporates as activists give up peaceful protests and seek to hit builders where it hurts -- their profit margins.
Described by one British company as ""eco-terrorism"", it is seen as the new business risk of the 1990s.
Famous names like Tarmac Plc, Costain Group Plc and ARC, a unit of conglomerate Hanson Plc, have all been targeted.
Activist groups are no longer seen by British firms as a harmless, badly organised ragbag of students and hippies.
""You only have to see them in action at protests,"" said David Harding, spokesman at ARC, Hanson's aggregates company. ""They walk around with mobile phones and camera equipment, they communicate and gather support for demos via the Internet -- we're talking about a highly sophisticated organisation.""
One road protestor under the codename Steady Eddie told construction journal ""Building"" earlier this year, ""If it comes down to full-scale economic warfare, we will aim to drive them out of business.""
As well as financial threats, companies also emphasise the ""terror"" tactics used.
Costain's contract to build the controversial Newbury bypass, which runs through a conservation area, has led to violent protests delaying building, bomb threats, staff intimidation and picketing of chief executive Alan Lovell's home.
A Costain spokesman told Reuters:""We've had all sorts of protests at the head office and the chief executive's house. But it's when it gets to the (employee) families -- that it goes across the line.""
Tactics used by some underground groups including the cryptic Berkshire Wood Elves, which distribute leaflets with instructions on home-made explosives, are now the subject of a police investigation.
Other larger activist groups include Earth First, The Land is Ours, Alarm UK and Road Alert.
The groups have targeted specific projects like the Newbury bypass and the M3 motorway through Twyford Down in the southern county of Hampshire.
But they are also campaigning on broader issue such as stopping the government road building programme and out-of-town superstores which they say create more traffic, pollution and damage local communities.
The government has slashed its road-building spending. Although protests may have contributed to the decision it has been seen primarily as economic rather than ecological.
Graham Watts, chief executive of the Construction Industry Council, said :""I don't think many firms involved in tendering for sensitive projects realise the impact environmental activity has on the cost of running a project.
""But they are more alert than they were 3-4 years ago. There's no doubt it's a big issue now.""
He says the damage comes in two forms: ""Tangible -- in the form of extra costs, additional security, threats to staff and the more intangible damage caused by negative publicity.""
Watts said the cost of protesting can be heavy once the company is locked into a contract.
""I do often hear on the industry circuit of tales where the company tenders at low margins and the demonstrations which follow means they are running the project at a loss.""
ARC says it's not just contractors in the front line but also suppliers like itself.
Its own quarries came under attack after it emerged that it may be a supplier for the Newbury bypass.
""It was called the ""First Battle of the Newbury bypass',"" said ARC's Harding.
""We had 300 Earth First protestors invade and occupy our site. Hundreds of thousands of pounds (dollars) of damage was done in one day. Plus there was the knock-on cost of lost production and extra security in future.""
Simon Brown, analyst at investement bank UBS, said this new phenomenon has led to a change in the way the industry evaluates project risk.
""When talking to Tarmac about the M3 link (through Twyford Down) they made it fairly clear that their risk assessment methods have been changed and now involve a very clear environmental risk analysis.""
Harding says others have done the same. ""As a result of eco-terrorism we are looking at controversial jobs more closely to see if the profit margins are wide enough to cover things like extra security.""
For an industry already suffering from razor-thin margins, overcapacity and stagnant demand, eco-terrorism is the latest bizarre twist in the construction sector's tale of woe.

2341,"Debt-laden Eurotunnel faced fresh financial pressure on Wednesday in the wake of the fire which swept through a main tunnel leaving a trail of damage, no running services and shaken consumer confidence.
Just one month after coming back from the brink of bankruptcy with a restructuring of nine billion pounds ($15 billion) of debt, the company faced uncertainy once again as one of its two rail tunnels remained shut pending a safety review.
Analysts said the modest fall in Eurotunnel shares since Monday's fire was about right, however, and few believed there would be long-term damage to customer confidence.
Eurotunnel has warned of reduced services for weeks ahead as repair work goes ahead and eats into revenues.
And one source close to Eurotunnel told Reuters that the cost of repairs may be heavier than first thought. ""The cost will be millions (of pounds) and could get into double figures, it you consider the damage to the 15 wagons and a locomotive, plus severe tunnel damage.""
He added that track sections may also need replacing after buckling in the intense heat.
While the tunnel remains shut, Eurotunnel is losing revenues at the rate of one million pounds a day. It also faces the cost of compensating passengers and tranferring them by air or ferry.
A Eurotunnel spokesman said all these costs should be covered by insurance, however.
""It will have very little impact,"" said one analyst. ""Transport disasters are always newsworthy but the bad publicity will soon fade away. Eurotunnel will be financially damaged, but you have to look at it in relation to the nine billion of debt.""
The ferries have been scooping up extra business from big freight customers like TNT, which said it would be using the ferries more as a result of the tunnel fire.
Andrew Darke, analyst at Williams de Broe, said ""There's clearly going to be some emotional reaction, but I expect it to be short-lived. After all passenger numbers rose after the Herald of Free Enterprise (ferry) disaster nine years ago.
""Disasters don't stop people travelling. People still go shopping in London despite IRA bombs,"" he said.
Eurotunnel had around 45 percent of the cross-Channel ferry market before the fire -- a share won partly by waging a cut-throat price-war with the ferries, which have since proposed linking up to battle against their tunnel rival.
Swedish ferry giant Stena Line and P&amp;O agreed to merge in October and are awaiting clearance from competition bodies.
Darke said P&amp;O's chances of clearance had been boosted by the tunnel disaster. The verdict is due later this month.

2343,"The story of Sea Launch sounds like the daring fiction of a James Bond movie -- with corporate giants from Russia, the United States, Norway and Ukraine joining forces to build the ultimate in space technology, firing satellite rockets into space from the Pacific Ocean.
The cost is 350 million pounds ($583.2 million), funded by a consortium of four companies, joining the East and West in a deal that claims it can undercut the cost of land-based launchers including the French-led Ariane, recently embarrassed by a rocket explosion, and NASA.
The lead Sea Launch investor is Boeing Co.'s Commercial Space division, holding 40 percent, with RSC-Energia of Russia taking a 25 percent slice, Norway's Kvaerner with 20 percent and NPO-Yuzhnoye of Ukraine holding 15 percent.
At a sneak preview in Norway recently, Svein Johnsen, Sea Launch project manager from Kvaerner, joked with Russian reporters that countries that had once built technology with conflict in mind were now united in their quest for profit.
""In the name of detente,"" he said.
Norway's Kvaerner is the prime contractor, building the mobile seaborne rocket launch platform and the command ship.
It rescued an off-shore oil rig, which had been severely damaged in a 1988 explosion, and rebuilt it to become a floating rocket launcher that will operate under remote control from a specially built command ship.
The platform is nearing completion at Stavanger in Norway, with the command ship under construction and ready for launch next month at Govan in Scotland.
The first rocket launch is scheduled for June 1998 from a site in the Pacific Ocean.
Satellites and rockets will be assembled on the ship for transfer to the platform, which will be evacuated before liftoff.
The command ship will press the control button for firing the rocket at a distance of two or three miles. The 10,600-ton ship has the added protection of blastproof safety glass.
The Russians will provide the Zenit rockets, chosen because they can be assembled horizontally on board the command ship.
Boeing will provide project management, marketing services and run the operation for liftoff.
Asked about the risk of explosion Johnsen said, ""The risk of explosion is very much related to this business. But we think that risk is very low. There are built-in safety features and it's a very sound operation from an insurance point of view.""
Ignition to release of the rocket takes 4.6 seconds, with emissions from the rocket on takeoff channelled sideways.
""If the emissions didn't go sideways, the pressure could shift the platform,"" he said, which weighs 23,000 tons.
Confidence in the system, a world-first, has been demonstrated by a rash of early contracts.
Hughes Space and Communications International Inc. of Los Angeles has 10 launches signed. Space Systems/Loral, also from California has five booked.
The groups involved have refused to comment on how much they will charge per launch or on potential profits, with Kvaerner's Johnson only stating that its slice will be ""a good return on our investment.""
It will be able to fire six to eight rockets a year. The idea was originally conceived by Boeing, which had intended to fire satellites from a supertanker.
But the danger involved made the platform idea more appealing, allowing evacuation before blastoff.

2363,"Mattel Inc president Jill Barad said the proposed acquisition of Tyco Toys Inc is not expected to face antitrust problems and should fuel earnings in the first year of the transaction.
""The market shares are still low even when you look at the category breakdowns,"" she said in a telephone interview.
Mattel, the nation's largest toymaker, earlier announced plans to buy third-place Tyco in a stock transaction valued at about $755 million. The combined market share of the companies would be less than 20 percent of the overall toy market.  
Barad said the deal includes a topping fee of $40 million, which would payable to Mattel if another company lured Tyco with a higher bid.  It also calls for a break-up fee of $15 million if the transaction were not completed within a year.
The transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 1997.
Barad declined to specify anticipated cost savings associated with the transaction, saying ""there are a lot and they cover many categories.""  She also said it was too early to assess the potential impact of the deal on Tyco's workforce.  
Barad said she approached Tyco about a transaction on Sept. 29 in a solitary meeting with Tyco chief executive officer Gary Baughman.  Representatives of both companies met again on Oct. 14.
The proposed transaction would significantly boost Mattel's position in the boys' toy market - an area that it sought to expand earlier this year with an unsolicited bid for number two toymaker Hasbro.  However, Mattel was forced to withdraw that offer after its proposal ran into fierce opposition on antitrust grounds.
""We really believe that the boys' toy business is a very important one.  We have never had big market share in that category,"" Barad said.
Any overlap in specific markets is not expected to be large enough to create antitrust concerns, Barad said.
For example, she noted Mattel's Hot Wheels holds a nine percent market share position in the ""wheels"" toy category and Tyco holds a 10 percent stake with Matchbox.
""It's very fragmented,"" Barad said, adding that the wheels category will become even more crowded as Hasbro emerges with a new product line.

2364,"The proposed union of Boeing Co and McDonnell Douglas Corp dramatically raises the stakes for survival in the defense industry, which already has experienced intense consolidation.
Global players, including Northrop Grumman Corp, Raytheon Co and Hughes Electronics Corp, are expected to seek partners in a new cycle of mergers.
""This has broken an uneasy truce in the defense industry,"" said Jon Kutler, president of Quarterdeck Investment Partners Inc, which specializes in aerospace and defense.  
Although the pace of defense mergers recently has slowed from the booming levels of early 1996, the Boeing-McDonnell Douglas combination is expected to trigger a resurgence of activity, industry experts said.
""This transaction establishes a level of scale that is going to urge additional consolidation. It's clearly going to drive us toward, instead of eight or 10 large firms, three or four mega-corporations,"" said James Schwendinger, director of Deloitte &amp; Touche's aerospace and defense practice.  
Northrop Grumman is viewed as a leading buyer of defense electronics properties. Shares of the company jumped 1-3/4 to 81-1/8 on views that the Boeing-McDonnell Douglas transaction may speed up its acquisition plans.
""All of a sudden, the scale of Northrop Grumman has been diminished by this merger,"" said one defense industry source who did not want to be identified.
Formed in 1994 from a union between Northrop and Grumman Corp, the company earlier this year bought Westinghouse Electric Corp's defense business for $3.6 billion in one of the biggest defense deals of 1996.  
A spokesman for Northrop Grumman declined to comment on merger activites, but noted that electronics is a growing part of the company's business.
""We have clearly embarked on a strategy of transforming the company from primarily an airplane builder to electronics,"" said Tony Cantafio.
Meanwhile, current defense industry leader Lockheed Martin Corp, which early this year bought Loral Corp for $9.1 billion, is viewed as well-positioned to compete against the new and larger Boeing. Lockheed Martin said in a statement on Monday that ongoing industry consolidation is vital.  
""They've gone from being king of the hill to having to share it. They're in an extremely strong position,"" Kutler said of Lockheed Martin.
The defense sector already has seen several consolidation cycles due to declines in federal spending. But those deals were dwarfed by the latest $13.9 billion merger announced on Sunday.
Industry experts said prices and bidding is expected to intensify for attractive properties, noting that reported seller Hughes Electronics is likely to benefit. Industry sources previously targeted McDonnell Douglas as a potential buyer of Hughes.  
A spokesman for Hughes could not be reached for comment, but the company previously has said in an SEC filing that it would consider acquisitions and consolidation.
Hughes is a unit of General Motors Corp.
The Boeing-McDonnell Douglas combination also is expected to trigger consolidation around the globe.
""This may set the stage for a whole new set of (buyers) from Europe,"" said Thomas Gallagher, head of the aerospace division at CIBC Woody Gundy, who expects cross-border consolidation in Europe to intensify.  
""The key dimension of defense today is scale. This business takes a huge amount of investment,"" Gallagher said.

2369,"Shares of American Medical Response Inc fell sharply Wednesday for a second consecutive session amid concern that the ambulance company was straying from its successful acquisition strategy.
The steep decline came after American Medical Response announced Tuesday an agreement to buy STAT Healthcare Inc in a stock transaction valued at $145 million.
The planned acquisition moves American Medical Response, which has bought 69 ambulance companies since 1992, into hospital emergency rooms and disease management.  
Shares of American Medical Response tumbled 2-5/8 to 31-7/8 by midafternoon Wednesday. The stock dropped three points after the transaction was announced on Tuesday.
Wall Street analysts said the deal was strategically sound from a long-term perspective, but noted that investors were wary of the company's shift into a new area.
""The skepticism, which we don't share, is related to the company's going into a business outside their consolidation within the ambulance industry,"" said Randall Huyser of Furman Selz.  
STAT Healthcare provides staffing for hospital emergency rooms. It also offers outpatient medical services such as kidney dialysis.
""Although the transaction makes sense to us conceptually, this new direction for the company may elicit a wait-and-see attitude from some investors who want to see success first in the new venture. Others may question how the disease management division will fit into the puzzle,"" Lehman Brothers analyst Jeffrey Kessler wrote in a report issued Wednesday.
Industry sources also cited the company's prediction the deal will slightly dilute earnings this year.  
In a conference call with investors and analysts on Tuesday, American Medical Response said the transaction would be accretive in 1997. It also expects cost savings of $2.5 million from the merger.
Industry analysts also noted that the acquisition would mark a logical extension of the company's existing services.

2370,"CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. said Monday they had entered discussions about their rival offers to buy Conrail Inc.
The two railroads did not disclose the specific nature of their talks, but Conrail's stock fell on views that the discussions would dampen the prospects of a bidding war for the Philadelphia-based railroad.
A source familiar with the companies said the discussions began late last week, continued through the weekend and into Monday.
Richmond, Va.-based CSX last month struck an agreement to buy Conrail in a $8.4 billion cash and stock transaction that valued Conrail at $92.50 per share. Norfolk Southern soon launched its own bid of $100 cash per share, or about $9 billion.
Since then, the two companies have been locked in a fight over their rival offers and taken the matter to court.
CSX, which said Norfolk Southern initiated the talks, said the discussions concerned ""a possible sale by the post-merger CSX/Conrail of certain material assets.""
Meanwhile, Norfolk Southern sought to quell speculation that it would abandon its bid for Conrail, saying that it was committed to its offer and has secured more than $15 billion to finance the proposed acquisition.
Norfolk Southern said the talks were started by CSX, adding that they were aimed at promoting competition.
""Our willingness to talk to CSX at its suggestion is consistent with my previously announced position that Conrail cannot be acquired by either CSX or NS without a plan to maintain a balanced competitive structure for Eastern railroad service. While I am heartened by CSX's willingness to discuss these matters, we have no reason to believe that Conrail is prepared to accept that reality,"" said Norfolk Southern Chief Executive Officer David Goode.
A battle for Conrail is viewed as being rife with difficulties for all the companies. Although Norfolk Southern has a higher offer on the table, analysts have said that Pennsylvania's corporate takeover law could be an obstacle to its proposed acquisition.
""This is not a good time to be having a long, drawn-out fight. The quicker they get to this, the better,"" said analyst Anthony Hatch of NatWest Securities.
Conrail shares had partly recovered from the early steep fall by late afternoon, trading down $1.50 per share at $93.75 on NYSE. CSX rose $1.50 to $44.50 and Norfolk Southern gained $1.375 to $90.75, also on the NYSE.

2377,"USAir Group Inc, determined to expand overseas, soon will be flying solo at a time when most of its competitors are entrenched in international alliances.
Industry experts said the Arlington, Va.-based airline will have a hard time finding a new partner to replace its passenger-sharing pact with British Airways Plc.
""USAir wants to duplicate something like the other major carriers have in Europe, but all the dance cards are already full,"" said one analyst who did not want to be identified.  
Over the past five years, cost-conscious airlines have struck marketing agreements with other carriers in order to extend their reach to new destinations that would be too expensive to serve on their own. Examples include links between Northwest Airlines Corp and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines NV and between UAL Corp and Deutsche Lufthansa AG.
On Thursday, USAir said it would terminate in March its passenger-sharing and frequent flier pact with British Airways due to the British carrier's proposed alliance with powerhouse AMR Corp.  
The move is expected to have little financial impact on USAir, which received far less revenue from the alliance than did British Airways.
Because most of the big carriers already have partners, analysts said USAir is likely to pursue international growth on its own for now.  It already is seeking the right to fly to London's coveted and restricted Heathrow Airport from several U.S. cities.
The desire for an expanded overseas role is also likely to prompt USAir to re-enter old markets, analysts said. It is best-known for its short-haul routes on the U.S. East Coast.  
""It may be that USAir may return to some of those areas,"" said John Steltzer, executive of airline consulting firm Worldwide Transportation Group Inc.
Although USAir has the highest cost structure of all major U.S. carriers, industry analysts said strong profit margins on long-haul flights would likely offset the expense associated with resuming service in some of those areas.
It also is likely to strike alliances with smaller European carriers that could transport passengers beyond any USAir destination.
""That would provide feed for their transatlantic operations, which they would need on that side of the ocean,"" said Raymond Neidl of Furman Selz.
In the longer term, however, many analysts remain convinced that USAir will need an extensive alliance or merger with another carrier.

2392,"A financial agreement between Barney's Inc. and Hong Kong-based Dickson Concepts International Ltd. will open the door to potential bidders for the famed New York luxury retailer.
Speculation about interested buyers has been rampant ever since Barney's filed for bankruptcy nearly a year ago.
Under a pact announced Tuesday, Barney's will pay Dickson up to $1 million to complete its financial review of Barney's and Dickson will submit a recapitalization proposal for the retailer.
In return, Barney's, which has been operating under bankruptcy protection since January, will make the financial information available to other prospective investors.
""We have the basis by which another investor can look at the information from that due diligence,"" said Barney's spokeswoman Sandra Sternberg.
Dickson and Saks Holdings Inc. previously have expressed interest in privately held Barney's. Neiman Marcus Group Inc. and Canada's Holt Renfrew also have been cited by industry experts as potential bidders.
Barney's has repeatedly said that it is not for sale but wants to talk with potential investors.
The pact with Dickson must be approved by the bankruptcy court, which may consider the issue as early as next week.
Officials at Saks, Neiman Marcus and privately held Holt Renfrew could not be reached for comment.
But Japanese retailer Isetan Co. Ltd., which is tangled in court with Barney's over a soured business arrangement, said it was not interested in buying Barney's.
""I don't think we're considering it right now. We're sitting on the sidelines,"" said spokesman Yasuo Okamoto.
Saks and Isetan joined forces in July to explore a plan for Barney's, but they never reached terms on a proposal.
Although Barney's has shuffled management to help turn around the troubled retailer, it is still viewed as weak in the luxury retail sector even as other companies are performing well.
Analysts, however, think a new owner or partner can breathe new life into the company.
""It can be viable going forward. It needs to be trimmed down and it needs merchandising talent,"" said Howard Eilenberg of Johnson Redbook Service.
Founded in 1923 by Barney Pressman and operated under the leadership of his grandsons Robert and Gene, Barney's has long been plagued by a reputation for weak management.

2400,"Florida is stepping up anti-smoking efforts by barring cigarette promotions on state roads, forcing Marlboro to drop its name from thousands of banners promoting the Marlboro Grand Prix of Miami motor race.
New rules detailing limits on using banners to promote sports events, to be published on Friday, are due to take effect in early March, a Florida Department of Transportation official said.
Banners for beer, tobacco and other products meant for adults are covered by the new rules. Promoters can place a product name on the banners but cannot use type faces, logos and colours associated with the banned products.
""Most sporting events have a corporate name attached to them and that name would be allowed,"" said department spokeswoman Lynn Holschuh. ""But if it's a product that can't be sold to minors, the banner can't contain logos or significant advertising promoting the product.""
Advertising on billboards, often located on private property, will not be affected by the new rules covering state roadways, the official said. The rules do not affect municipal, Interstate and other roads maintained by other governments.
In Miami, an IndyCar-class grand prix site since 1983, thousands of coloured banners no longer bear the Marlboro name, even though the Feb. 4 to March 2 competition is officially called the Marlboro Miami Grand Prix presented by Toyota.
Banners for the event say simply, Grand Prix of Miami presented by Toyota.
Last year's banners carried the distinctive red colour and bold typface of Marlboro, the most popular cigarette in the United States.
A spokeswoman for Philip Morris Cos. Inc., maker of Marlboro cigarettes, said the company had chosen to drop the Marlboro name from the banners as a courtesy. State officials, including anti-tobacco activist Gov. Lawton Chiles, complained about the Marlboro signs last year.
""We will have signage and merchandise and cigarettes for sale to people 21 and over at the site,"" said Philip Morris spokeswoman Tara Carraro. ""We really want to reach smokers choosing brands.""
Marlboro, which along with RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. is a major sponsor of motorsports events, will back other IndyCar events this year in California, Ohio, New Hampshire, Wisconsin and elsewhere.
Such sponsorships are major promotional outlets for the U.S. tobacco industry, with the top two producers spending $50 million or more each year on motorsports sponsorships, according to the IEG Sponsorship Report newsletter.
Marlboro spent about $19 million on motorsport sponsorships and likely as much again on related advertising and promotion during 1996, according to David Jacobsen, senior editor at IEG.
Cigarette advertising has been banned since the 1960s from U.S. television and steadily driven from sponsoring many other sports. The industry now faces still stricter federal government limits on promoting its products.
The federal rules, the first of which are to take effect on Feb. 28, sharply curtail cigarette advertising near schools and playgrounds and in publications favoured by people under 18.
A spokesman for the National Centre for Tobacco Free Kids, an anti-smoking group, said Florida's roadway ban was unusual. Some local transit systems, in San Francisco and elsewhere, have dropped tobacco advertising, he said.
A spokesman for Chiles, who is spearheading a billion-dollar lawsuit against the tobacco industry and advocating new state taxes on cigarettes, described him as pleased by the Marlboro's decision to take its name off the Miami race banners.

2408,"Tony O'Reilly, best known in America as H.J. Heinz chairman, has the U.S. food group slimming down while beefing up his family's Independent Newspapers Plc of Ireland.
Independent, an acquisitive, fast-growing company that is 28 percent owned by O'Reilly and his family, competes in deals and markets with such international media figures as Rupert Murdoch of News Corp. Ltd.
O'Reilly's name came up just this week in London markets as the rumoured buyer of Mirror Group Newspapers Plc's 46 percent stake in Britain's Independent Newspapers Plc for $100 million.
While O'Reilly knocked down deal speculation on the Independent, a leading British daily in which his firm already has a 46 percent holding, he hinted in an interview that he has an eye on buying into leading Australian publisher John Fairfax Holdings Ltd.
""The situation there is fluid, very interesting,"" O'Reilly said. ""You can just say the O'Reillys are looking on with interest.""
Since the early 1970s, when the former rugby star and food industry executive bought into Independent, the company has steadily expanded and sells 80 percent of Ireland's nationally distributed newspapers.
Independent also has radio partnerships and controlling shares of leading newspaper businesses in New Zealand and South Africa and a French billboard company.
Financial performance has been very strong, with the stock market value of Independent rising a heady sixfold in five years.
In Pittsburgh, the headquarters of Heinz, the drill is largely different.
O'Reilly, in the telephone interview from Dublin, said the food company he has run since 1979 was in deal talks with prospective buyers and would sell substantial businesses by April 30.
""By the end of the fiscal year, the businesses will have a leaner focus,"" he said.
O'Reilly declined to identify the businesses on the auction block or estimate how much cash the properties would bring Heinz, which dominates in canned tuna, ketchup and other segments.
""If I tell you, that's where the bargaining will start,"" O'Reilly said. He said Heinz was in contact with four or five potential buyers.
The executive said Heinz will trim down to six business clusters: food-service products, pet food, infant formula outside the United States, condiments, ketchup, and weight-loss services and products.
One-third to one-quarter of Heinz businesses covering thousands of products are estimated to be outside those areas.
""The buzz word now is focus,"" O'Reilly said.
Acquisitions at Heinz, known for its Weight Watchers services and brands such as 9 Lives pet food, are not ruled out. The company, in fact, just broke off talks aimed at acquiring some assets of Bumble Bee, a competitor to its StarKist line of canned tuna. Heinz is also digesting a large pet-food acquisition it made from Quaker Oats.
Beyond being known as a newspaper baron outside North America, O'Reilly has interests in other Irish firms. Another he leads as chairman, Irish crystal and china firm Waterford Wedgwood, Thursday agreed to buy 9.1 percent of a German porcelain group Rosenthal AG.
O'Reilly, 60, is widely regarded as Ireland's richest man and appears close to being, if not already, Ireland's only billionaire, associates said.

2409,"The head of America's most popular cable television service said on Tuesday that Latin American television will continue booming into the 21st century and that pan-regional advertising would shoot up to $1 billion within a decade.
Kay Koplovitz, chief executive of U.S.A. Networks, told an industry conference that cross-boarder advertising on Latin American cable television and Direct-to-Home (DTH) was about $50 million to $75 million in 1996 but was poised for spectacular growth as new DTH services penetrate Latin America's 80 million television households.  
""I really believe it will reach $1 billion in the next decade,"" Koplovitz said.
Audiences for cable and DTH in Latin American were affluent and younger than those in North America, characteristics that should appeal to advertisers.
""This audience is younger and vibrant for consumer goods,"" she said.  
Some industry analysts and executives have questioned the appeal of pan-regional programming and advertising in Latin America saying Argentine and Mexican and other national audiences have varying taste and a much more pronounced hunger for local programming.
Koplovitz likened the state of multiple-channel television in Latin America to the early days of U.S. cable television in the 1970s, when advertisers shunned the new medium because audience measurements were crude or nonexistent.  
""We need a reliable, standardized amd pan-regional measuring system,"" she told an audience of entertainment industry executives at a conference sponsored by the Variety trade newspaper.
She also predicted that the governmental restrictions on DTH in some countries would melt away before the force of illegal satellite-dish sales and as taxing authorities realized that growing revenues streams were going untapped.  
According to Kagan Associates, a consulting group, cable television and DTH revenues in Latin America will grow to $8.1 billion by 2001. Industry revenues were about $2.5 billion last year in Latin America.
Kagan has also estimated that only a bit more than 13 percent of Latin America's television homes subscribe to some form of multiple-channel television. By contrast, multiple-channel television penetration in the United States is more than 60 percent.  
""Latin America is one of the fastest growing and underdeveloped TV markets in the world,"" Koplovitz said.
The expansion of DTH services by big international media ventures will be key in expanding pan-regional advertising, she said.  
One Latin American DTH service, called Galaxy is owned by GM Hughes of the United States, Cisneros Group of Venezuela, Multivision of Mexico and TVA Abril of Brazil. Its main competitor is Sky Entertainment, owned by multinational News Corp Ltd, Tele-Communications Inc of the United States, Mexico's Televisa and TV Globo of Brazil.
""This is a market destine to grow, and grow it will,"" Koplovitz said.

2418,"The Florida judge in a class-action suit against tobacco groups Thursday allowed one of the pioneering case's lead smokers to take a back seat in the upcoming trial after he complained of intimidation.
Stanley Rosenblatt, the lawyer pursuing the class-action suit on behalf of all ill and addicted smokers in Florida, said in Dade County Court that Arthur Reeves had been one of the original six smokers in the suit filed three years ago but did not want to take a prominent role as a witness in a trial scheduled for Sept. 8.
""He feels he has been greatly embarrassed and humiliated by investigators going out and asking neighbours and relatives and people he hasn't seen in 30 years about him,"" Rosenblatt said.
The lawyer gave no details in court, but said at a news conference Wednesday that private investigators working for tobacco companies routinely checked the backgrounds of people opposing them in court and potential trial jurors.
Rosenblatt asked Dade County Circuit Court Judge Alan Postman to allow another smoker, throat-cancer victim Frank Amodeo of Orlando, Fla., to be substituted for Reeves.
Amodeo said Wednesday he began smoking at 14, more than a decade before the health dangers of smoking were known, and that he has tried to stop smoking repeatedly. He still smokes and takes liquid nourishment through a feeding tube, since he can neither eat nor drink.
Rosenblatt said Reeves was not withdrawing from the suit, an option any ill smoker in Florida can choose, but would not act as a representive of the 500,000 potential claimants Rosenblatt has estimated his suit covers.
Reeves would share in money awards, if any, secured through the trial. The case appears likely to be the first to come to trial of a dozen or more class-action suits filed by smokers against tobacco companies.
Rosenblatt claims that tobacco companies such as Liggett Group, RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., Loews Corp. and the Brown &amp; Williamson unit of B.A.T Industries conspired for decades to hide medical evidence damaging to their businesses and mislead Americans about the dangers of smoking.
A lawyer for Philip Morris Cos. Inc. said that allowing the switch just months before trial was unfair.
The lawyer, Philip Heim, said he had no knowledge of Reeves' complaints. ""I don't know anything about him being allegedly harassed,"" Heim said.

2428,"Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth said on Friday U.S. cigarette makers had delayed harsh revelations about the industry with a surprising decision to end pre-trial opposition to punitive damages in the state's multi-billion dollar anti-tobacco lawsuit.
Butterworth told Reuters a court hearing set for January 24 on the punitive claims to be added to any other jury awards would have made public information he alleged would have been highly damaging about the industry's marketing and medical research, contained in 27,000 pages of court-sealed documents.  
""I liken it to a criminal trial in which the defendant tries to suppress evidence that would prove him guilty,"" Butterworth said.  ""They want to delay.  It's their best short-term ploy.""
Florida is one of 18 states suing U.S. cigarette companies to recoup billions of dollars spent through government healthcare programs on treating people made ill by smoking.  A trial in the Florida lawsuit filed by Butterworth is set for August 4.  
Philip Morris Cos Inc and other cigarette companies, complaining of likely bad publicity, earlier dropped pre-trial opposition to punitive claims by the State of Florida.  The state is seeking to recoup $1 billion or more for treating Medicaid costs from 1994.
Philip Morris Cos Inc lawyer Gregory Little said in a news release that the industry's decision had no legal effect and that the industry had never paid punitive damages in any lawsuit.  
Little said a key reason for the industry's decision was a worry that the state's lawyers would present evidence against cigarette makers during a public, pre-trial hearing.  Tobacco lawyers would be severly restricted in defending against the evidence during the hearing, he said.
""The lawyers for the state of Florida have demonstrated a remarkable propensity for trying their case in the media,"" Little said.
He accused anti-tobacco lawyers in Florida of leaking documents to reporters.  
""... The January 24 hearing -- which was already window dressed for media consumption with a 442-page brief and 12 boxes of documents -- would have done nothing other than provide a platform for the plaintiffs' lawyers to once again trumpet their case making it difficult for all parties to seat an unbiased jury,"" Little said.
Other tobacco companies, including RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp, have accused anti-tobacco lawyers of selective and unfair leaks to the media.  
Butterworth said he was forbidden by court order from detailing the damaging information in the documents but said 90 percent of the material came from industry internal documents. Much of the material was gathered by other attorneys general, many of whom are cooperating in their anti-tobacco lawsuits.
""It's nearly all their documents, all about their marketing practices, their science ... and they are giving up everything to avoid publicity,"" Butterworth said.
""This is a 100 percent victory for the state,"" he said of the industry's decision.
""The only downside is that disclosure of the documents is delayed.""
A trial in the lawsuit is scheduled to begin on August 4 in West Palm Beach, Florida.

2431,"A Florida judge said Friday that he was inclined to let stand civil claims filed under state anti-racketeering laws against the tobacco industry.
Speaking from the bench at the start of a preliminary hearing, Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Harold Cohen said he was inclined to let stand claims filed by the state using Florida's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupts Organisations Act, which could mean more losses for cigarette makers.
""It would seem that the state can maintain the RICO actions,"" Cohen said.
The claims under state RICO laws were added last month to the state's existing lawsuit that seeks at least $1 billion compensation for treating smokers' illnesses.
The judge said he would not make up his mind until the end of oral arguments on Friday.
He gave no timetable for making public his decision on a request by Philip Morris Cos. and other cigarette makers that the claims made by the state under RICO laws be thrown out.
Florida State Attorney General Bob Butterworth said before the hearing that a victory against tobacco companies using the RICO law would allow the court to triple the more than $1 billion dollars in damages claimed by the state.
He also said a victory in Florida using its RICO law would widen the war against the tobbaco industry by possibly allowing other states to sue under their own RICO laws.
Lawyer Irving Nathan, representing the tobacco industry, said that lawsuits brought by state governments under anti-racketeering laws were meant to demonise cigarette manufacturers and turn Americans against a legitimate industry.
Nathan argued that the RICO laws did not apply to the tobacco companies that are also being sued in Florida.
The state of Florida in 1995 filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry, seeking $1 billion or more for health care costs paid for poor people afflicted with smoking-related ailments.
Last month the state amended the suit using the RICO law and claiming that the tobacco companies had conspired with one another to confuse Americans about the dangers of smoking.
Cohen is not expected to rule for weeks on the tobacco defendents' request that the RICO claims be dismissed but he said in opening remarks that he was inclined to allow the Florida state lawyers to go ahead with the RICO-based claims.
A jury trial of the suit is tentatively scheduled for August 1997, the judge said.
Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore, who accompanied Butterworth to the hearing along with Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods, said the lawsuits filed by 19 states and several cities were about much more than mere money. The lawsuits were needed to alert people to the dangers of smoking and help curb smoking among teenagers.
""That helps me sell the litigation more than the money,"" Moore said.

2446,"R.J. Reynolds executives considered using additives to enhance the nicotine kick of cigarettes and also considered beefing up marketing to teenagers, according to a summary of documents that the company's parent turned over in a Minnesota lawsuit.
R.J. Reynolds, a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., said Friday it turned over the documents to Minnesota state lawyers in connection with a lawsuit the state has filed against tobacco companies to recover state money spent on treating smoking-related illnesses.
Along with other tobacco companies, R.J. Reynolds is being sued by Minnesota and 17 other states to recover billions of dollars spent treating smoking-related illnesses. Trials those lawsuits are scheduled this year in Mississippi, Florida and Texas.
R.J. Reynolds said it expected anti-tobacco information to be leaked selectively to news organisations by opposing lawyers and was releasing three potentially damaging short excerpts from the 4.5 million pages of documents with its own explantions.
The company said it would not release the full documents.
It said two documents it turned over to Minnesota lawyers under court order suggested that the company in the 1970s studied adding ammonia compounds to increase the effects of nicotine from cigarette smoking.
If ammonia were ""found to make desirable contributions to the physiological satisfactions derived from smoking, we will want to optimize this effect in existing and/or new products,"" the company quoted one 1973 company document as saying.
Cigarette makers have long denied that they tried to manipulate the nicotine effects from their products.
R.J. Reynolds said the research was carried out when the industry and others thought low-tar cigarettes with heightened nicotine kicks would be less harmful to smokers.
R.J. Reynolds deputy general counsel Daniel Donohue said he expected the Minnesota lawyers to use the documents to try to bolster claims that the company was manipulating nicotine to hook smokers.
Anti-tobacco activists have repeatedly accused the industry of manipulating nicotine levels.
Philip Morris Cos. Inc., the world's biggest cigarette maker and producer of Marlboro and other brands, won a large settlement and an on-air apology from the ABC television network for a news story suggesting it manipulated nicotine content in its cigarettes.
R.J. Reynolds also quoted from a 1980 memo sent by a marketing executive to the chairman stating that market share among smokers aged 14 to 17 was falling while Philip Morris' share was growing.
""Hopefully our various planned activities that will be implemented this fall will aid in some way in reducing or correcting those trends,"" the official wrote.
Donohue described the memo as shorthand and said it in no way suggested Reynolds worked to sell cigarettes to teenagers. He said company data on young smokers was collected as a by-product of market research on adults.
The Food and Drug Administration issued new rules last summer meant to curb sales to underage smokers, but the industry is challenging the rules.
R.J. Reynolds said it was releasing the excerpts because it expected the memos and studies to be leaked and reported by journalists without full context.
""Cherry picked, leaked documents do not reflect the totality of our company's positions, strategies and marketplace efforts,"" Peggy Carter, a spokeswoman for RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., said in a statement.
Minnesota Attorney General Hubert Humphrey III said the company was misleading the public by complaining of alleged selective leaks by anti-tobacco lawyers.
""The vast majority of documents cannot be made public due to a protective order demanded by the tobacco industry,"" he said in a news release.
""If the tobacco industry truly wanted the public to know the whole truth, it would waive this protective order .... I challenge them to do so.""
A trial in the Minnesota lawsuit is set for 1998, Humphrey spokesman Joe Loveland said.

2447,"Silver King Communications Inc chairman Barry Diller said on Monday that the $1.27 billion stock-swap acqusition of Home Shopping Network would help fund Silver King's ambitious broadcasting plans.
""We have a long agenda and this helps certainly in developing the stations. We will get there quicker by combining the two companies,"" Diller told Reuters in a telephone interview.
Silver King agreed earlier to acquire HSN, a limping number two in U.S. TV retailing, for $1.27 billion in stock.  
The deal reunites Silver King, owner of 12 U.S. television stations spun off in 1992 by HSN, with its old parent and feeds speculation that Diller is close to launching a seventh U.S. television network.
Diller described as premature the speculation he would start a new national network, but said the cash flow from HSN would help Silver King pay for programming and other costs in developing its stations.  
Diller, a celebrated Hollywood executive credited with leading the 1980s launch of the FOX network, had already announced plans to drop HSN programming now carried on Silver King's stations in order to replace it with a traditional mix of locally oriented news, sports and other shows.
The stations in major markets such as Miami, New York and Los Angeles could attract significant audiences eagerly sought by advertisers, become much more valuable and form the nucleus of a national television network, industry analysts said.
""Silver King will use Home Shopping's cash flow. That will be the start of the benefits,"" Diller said.
""For Home Shopping, it adds businesses it is not now in,"" he said, adding the combined companies would be financially vigorous and poised to exploit new forms of electronic retailing.
""I am thrilled with the combination,"" Diller said.
""As to its more expansive possibilities, I believe the combination will allow the companies the very best way to pursue their very aggressive individual agendas with clarity and without conflict.""

2460,"Sema Group, the fast-growing Anglo-French information technology group, said on Friday it was banking on growth from its telecoms and business systems operations in 1997.
But director of communications Marie-Claude Bessis told Reuters that although the group was seeking to expand into Germany and the U.S., Sema plans to focus on maintaining robust organic growth this financial year.
""1997 will be a year of integration...It will not be a year of acquisitions like 1996 and even 1995,"" Bessis told Reuters by telephone from Paris.
""From 1997 we will see the opportunities...But the objective will be to integrate the acquisitions, to maintain a strong organic growth and to accelerate the telecom and business system market,"" she said.
Spending on technology is surging in the fast-growing telecoms market and Sema has signed agreements with Global One -- the alliance of Sprint, Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom, which is an indirect shareholder in Sema -- and AT&amp;T.
The group is developing value-added services and two-way messaging for AT&amp;T's wireless arm and is integrating the computer systems of Global One.
Sema's first rights issue to raise 99 million stg for acquisitions and growth last year has left the group with 18 million stg of cash and no gearing.
And acquisitions such as the purchase of France Telecom's stake in IT systems integration business Telis last year have given Sema substantial new resources and know-how in the fixed telephone market.
A recent acquisition spree has brought not only Telis, but British Rail's business services arm and a majority stake in Olivetti's Sytax processing unit into Sema's fold. The first two are expected to add 170 million stg to group turnover in 1997.
Sema, which is quoted on the London and Paris stock exchanges, earlier reported a 35 percent rise in annual year pre-tax profits to 50 million stg on sales of 927 million stg -- a rise of 37 percent.
Organic growth rose a sharp 20 percent and its order book jumped 66 percent to 1.25 billion pounds. But Bessis said she expected average annual growth of around 13 percent from all businesses, including the slower technology arm which includes control and command systems for the Royal Navy.
Sema's telecoms systems business saw 44 percent growth and its business systems, which includes the high-margin outsourcing and systems integrations operations, saw 46 percent growth over the year, Bessis said.
The company, whose shares have surged from 532p to 1275 pence over the year, was one of the best performers on the stock exchange last year.
And Sema says it is unconcerned at its soaring price earnings ratio of around 40 times which could make the shares look expensive.
It's a good sector and it's a company which is growing spectacularly,"" Bessis said. ""We've had five years of tremendous results -- not just one year.""
But the shares slipped 23.5p to 1226.5p by 1115 GMT.
Double-digit compound growth is expected to be fuelled by the vast workload as companies prepare computer systems for European Monetary Union and what has been dubbed the ""millenium problem"" -- adjusting computers to handle dates from 2000.
The bill for these preparations has been tipped by consultants and analysts to be anything from 32-360 billion pounds.

2471,"Shares in Cable and Wireless, Britain's second biggest telecoms group, lost more ground on Tuesday as analysts said the $20 billion creation of Anglo-U.S. Concert Plc had thrown the group its biggest challenge to date.
Uninspiring results from Cable and Wireless' (C&amp;W) lucrative Hong Kong subsidiary, Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd, on which the British group relies for about 75 percent of attributable profits, also helped depress the stock.
C&amp;W, faced with a change of government in Hong Kong next July and growing competition in the territory, has also been dogged by talk that it may have to sell part of its Hong Kong stake in return for a worthwhile position in China. ""I think the Hong Kong Telecom figures this morning served to remind people that that is where most of the money comes from,"" said John Tysoe, telecoms analyst at SG Strauss Turnbull. ""Not a particularly sparkling set of figures.""
The Hong Kong unit lifted net profits 12.1 percent, under some analysts' expectations, to HK$5.39 billion.
While C&amp;W's shares ended five pence lower at 470.5p, executives of its Hong Kong unit insisted that they were unconcerned by the mega-merger, announced over the weekend, between British Telecommunications and MCI Communications to form the second biggest international carrier.
But analysts said the huge merger, creating a $54 billion company, posed a substantial threat to telecom rivals and could make it harder for C&amp;W to expand in the United States.
""What we saw at the weekend has thrown down the gauntlet to everyone else,"" Tysoe said. ""It is a challenge to absolutely every other operator and I'm not sure that half of those other guys have got a coherent response.""
Had Cable and Wireless' own merger talks with BT not broken down in May, that deal, valued at about 33 billion pounds ($54.54 billion), as a deal would have easily eclipsed the BT/MCI merger.
But BT's new strategic plans makes it one of the biggest players in America behind market leader AT&amp;T.
Cable and Wireless' own U.S. operation brings in annual revenues of about 0.5 billion pounds -- a far cry from BT's share, which now jumps to around $18 billion a year.
Analysts agree that BT has proved to the market that Cable and Wireless (C&amp;W) is bid proof, partly because it is hard to value its Hong Kong stake. What the do see happening however, is that C&amp;W will seek to increase its foothold in the increasingly competitive U.S. telecoms market and link up with new partners.
""The important thing for C&amp;W is to get more of a presence there and my guess is that they will do that in an alliance,"" Tysoe said.
Few industry analysts took market rumours seriously that BT's latest expansion plans would prompt its arch-rival in the international market, AT&amp;T, to bid for C&amp;W -- or even launch an immediate takeover of mobile phone operator Vodafone.
As for an alliance partner for C&amp;W, the bets were on NYNEX Corp. Its subsidiary NYNEX CableComms is the largest minority shareholder in Cable and Wireless Communications, an alliance creating Britain's largest cable operator.
NYNEX also has an international diversification strategy centered around the Far East, similar to that of C&amp;W. Other potential U.S. partners could be Pacific Telesis (PacTel), which is being taken over by SBC Communications. However, PacTel is more interested in central or south America, analysts said.

2474,"Vodafone Group, Britain's biggest mobile phones firm, posted a sharp 21 percent rise in first half profits on Tuesday and insisted that the mobile market was likely to maintain a robust 20-25 percent growth rate next year.
Vodafone also announced it was buying The People's Phone Company, its biggest high-street retailer and service provider of mobile phones, for about 77 million pounds ($129 million).
Vodafone, which is licenced to serve over 250 million people in 13 countries, now has five wholly-owned service providers which, along with investments in another four, represent over 70 percent of its subscriber base with more than 410 branded shops.
Pretax profits in the first half of the year rose to 252 million pounds -- after a 17.2 million pound exceptional credit on asset disposals -- on sales of 771.5 million pounds, 16 percent higher than last time.
The dividend, up 20 percent at 2.36p per share, also came in at the top-end of expectations, helping the shares to close 11 pence higher at 254.5 pence.
Outgoing chief executive Sir Gerald Whent dismissed newspaper articles heralding what he called ""doom and gloom"" in the mobile phone market, saying that he expected a similar growth in net new connections to this year.
""Vodafone has only just begun,"" he stated.
His successor, Chris Gent, told a news conference that the total market for mobile communications grew by 1,428,000 in the first six months of the year -- six percent less than in the same period last year.
The group netted 2,654,000 subscribers at the end of September 1996 in its core British market, with overall growth in the period of 203,000 compared to 371,000 last year.
But Gent said the rate of decline was slowing and figures for October and November indicated a better quarter than the last two -- even before the key Christmas period.
""It may be that in previous years figures were inflated by customers attracted to cellular before they were ready to make a long term commitment,"" he said.
Despite a 1.3 percent dip in market share as rivals such as smaller digital mobile phones group Orange leave their indelible mark, Vodafone said it still had 42 percent of the mobile phone market and remained the market leader.
Vodafone's total customer base has swollen to 2,654,000 on its analogue network and 945,000 digital customers.
""Vodafone rarely disappoints and it certainly hasn't this time around,"" said Evan Miller, telecoms analyst at brokers CS First Boston. ""Rumours of the demise of the UK mobile phone market have proved premature. There is life in the market and Vodafone is taking more than its fair share of it.""
Vodafone, which celebrated its fifth anniversary as a fully independent company last month, has generated robust profits which last year amounted to 473 million pounds with operating cash flows of 621 million pounds.
A proposed $20 billion merger between British Telecommunications and America's MCI sparked rumours that U.S. telecoms giant AT&amp;T may want to increase its presence in Britain by acquiring Vodafone.
But Gent told Reuters in an interview that the group had not had talks with AT&amp;T and doubted such a deal would emerge. ""Anything is possible, but we haven't been approached,"" he said.
As the British mobile market becomes increasingly competitive, Vodafone has invested in mobile businesses through western Europe and the Pacific Rim which contributed a maiden 9.9 million pound profit before interest, tax and a 3.9 million pound charge for its Hong Kong operation.
Foreign interests, including a stake in France's Societe Francaise du Radiotelephone (SFR), a stake in the German operator E-Plus Mobilfunk, and operations in Australia, South Africa, Greece and Hong Kong, turned in a loss of about 17 million pounds in the first half of last year.
But the company is on track for reaping 30 percent of profits from overseas operations by 2000, Gent said.

2477,"British Telecommunications admitted on Thursday to not sharing the same culture as its merger partner MCI Communications, America's second largest international carrier.
But after reporting robust third quarter profits, helped by ""healthy"" demand for its products and services, BT's chief executive Sir Peter Bonfield told reporters, ""We are open minded that these things (mergers) have their pitfalls on culture.""
Commentators have dubbed BT ""staid"" and MCI ""spunky"". But Bonfield said MCI staff he had met so far had been ""amazingly enthusiastic"" about the two companies' planned $20 billion merger, which BT expects European and American regulators to clear by this autumn.
After a 39 million pound ($64 million) charge for redundancies, BT's third quarter pretax profits rose to 909 million pounds ($1.45 billion) from 829 million pounds last time -- towards the upper end of analysts expectations.
BT announced last October that it planned to buy the 80 percent of MCI that it did not already own. The new group, called Concert Plc, aims to service multinational companies end-to-end and be represented in all the world's key nations.
BT also hopes to become the second telecoms operator in continental Europe as key markets are eased open to competition in 1998 and is itching to get into lucrative Asian markets.
BT has one of the most comprehensive network partnerships across Europe, having set up joint ventures in about eight continental European markets worth more than $140 billion.
In a move to boost its German venture, BT announced that Norwegian telecoms operator Telenor had agreed in principle to take a 10 percent stake in VIAG InterKom, the alliance BT has set up with German engineering conglomerate VIAG AG.
Telenor brings with it vital expertise from operating in one of the world's most saturated markets for mobile telephones. Having won a mobile and fixed-line licence in Germany, BT said VIAG InterKom would be the first major telecoms copany to exploit the convergence between the two services.
In December, BT beat arch-rivals Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom by clinching a deal with TeleDanmark in Switzerland's second telecom network Newtelco.
While global telecoms groups jockey for position in a race to secure lucrative services to multinational companies, Japan is seen as the last major frontier.
BT has been wooing Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp, the world's biggest telecoms titan, for years.
While NTT takes its time to decide how best to enter the international market, BT's finance director Robert Brace told Reuters that the group did not expect an MCI-type deal in the Asian telecoms markets ""in the next few years"".
""I think we will continue to develop on a global basis as and when the opportunities arrive,"" he said.
Bonfield, who was in Japan last week, said NTT was too big a company to risk linking up with a single company.
""But it may come up with a preferred partner -- and we would like to be that partner,"" he said. BT, which already has a technology agreement with NTT, is keen to use the $150 billion group's lines to sell its Concert services to business clients.
BT's share price, which has surged to new year highs of 450p in the run-up to results, seesawed despite what SocGen's analyst John Tysoe called ""a good, cheerful presentation"".
Tysoe has edged up his full year forecast to a pretax profit of 3.2 billion pounds, largely because of a 50 million pound reduction in the level of expected redundancy charges.
BT saw net cash inflow swell to 4.4 billion pounds in the first nine months and has now got a hefty 211 million pounds of funds on its balance sheet.

2481,"British Telecommunications (BT) and its American partner MCI will ""move heaven and earth"" to link up with Japan's restructured telecoms giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT), analysts said on Friday.
BT welcomed news that the Japanese government had decided to split NTT into three parts under one holding company as part of its efforts to reach a compromise while liberalising the world's second biggest telecoms market.
""BT...welcomes the news that NTT is to be given the opportunity to operate on a truly international basis,"" a company spokesman told Reuters.
The British telecoms giant, which announced last month that it wanted to merge with America's second biggest long-distance carrier MCI to create Concert Plc, has openly stated that the enlarged group should give it more clout to woo NTT as part of its ticket into the booming Asian telecoms markets.
But he declined to say whether news that Japan will restructure NTT into two regional and one long-distance group would help BT in its quest to link up with the Japanese titan.
""We've always said we'd like NTT to be our partner in Japan,"" he said, but added: ""We can't say whether this makes it easier and better...""
Analysts said that Japan's decision to restructure NTT, the world's biggest telecoms company, had been well flagged and it was now up to BT, MCI and their proposed combined company, dubbed Concert Plc, to forge a deal.
But the difficulty was how to establish partial ownership of an asset in Japan without significant earnings dilution.
""If BT can form a partnership with this new holding company structured NTT -- with access to the international market -- then that's game, set and match,"" said John Tysoe, telecoms analyst at brokers Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull.
""My feeling is that Concert will probably move heaven and earth try and do a deal with NTT now -- and NTT would probably be crazy to take on anyone else as a partner. Concert has got the product set which everyone wants.""
Taking any significant stake in NTT would not only be hugely expensive but dilute earnings. Foreign companies would find themselves paying a lot of money for few earnings simply because the price earnings ratio of NTT is so high, analysts noted.
""There are still foreign ownership restrictions on NTT which will not be lifted until next year,"" said Andrew Harrington, telecoms analyst at Salomon Brothers.
""But we do know BT wants to establish some form of global alliance with NTT, be it in the form of a marketing agreement, some sort of equity swap or a straightforward equity stake.
""I dont think BT knows what it is going to do yet.""
If the creation of Concert wins regulatory approval next year, it will be one of the largest end-to-end telecoms services providers for multi-national companies as the worldwide telecoms market is rapidly being liberalised.
Rivals include French and newly-floated German telecoms groups France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, that have linked up with U.S. long-distance carrier Sprint to form Global One -- and U.S. telecoms giant AT&amp;T, which has set up World Partners with 16 companies.
NTT, which currently is a purely domestic operator with a stranglehold on the domestic Japanese market, has a market capitalisation that at around $120 billion, eclipses all others.
Japan's Posts ministry said earlier today that the NTT restructuring may not be put into place until 1999-2000.

2489,"Britain's Airtours proved on Wednesday that package holidays is a sunny business by beating forecasts with record profits and looking to spend up to 250 million pounds ($413 million) on further acquisitions.
Pretax profits in the year to the end of September soared 46.1 percent to 86.8 million pounds, topping even the most optimistic forecasts of 82 million pounds.
Earnings per share jumped 39 percent to 45.63 pence and Airtours raised dividends for the year 14.3 percent to 16 pence.
As the summer holiday buying season gets into full swing, Airtours -- one of Britain's three big quoted tour operators -- has seen bookings rise a sharp 57.2 percent on last year.
With winter bookings up 12.6 percent in Britain, a sharp 92 percent higher in Scandinavia and 58.9 percent up in Canada, chairman and chief executive David Crossland predicted an encouraging outlook for all the group's major markets.
""They were very good figures,"" said one analyst, adding that he had nudged up his full year forecasts for 1997 to 103 million pounds from 100 million pounds. Airtours's shares bucked a weak market trend and rose nine pence to 712 pence.
Crossland told Reuters that the group was keen to boost its cruising business, buy a new U.S. or Canadian company or find another country in Europe where it could have a similar businesses to those it already owns in Scandinavia and Britain.
""We're probably in a position to spend between about 200 and 250 million pounds on the right sort of acquisition,"" he said, adding: ""We have the resources to be able to do that today.""
Airtours, whose dividends are covered more than three times by earnings, has a robust balance sheet and about 425 million pounds of cash. It said there would be significant opportunities for expansion which it would ""exploit as they arise"".
Record profits were fuelled by strong results from its Scandinavian operations where Airtours owns Premiair, the largest leisure airline in the region, and careful pricing in Britain with fewer packages on offer, the firm said.
Summer 1997 will see about the same number of packages as this year, but they will attract more long haul, flight and cruise and ""all inclusive"" holiday makers -- packages which have a higher sales price and better margins, Crossland said.
""We shall maintain our capacity at or about the same level as summer 1996 and if this position is maintained across the industry the rewards could be substantial,"" he noted.
The thee big operators -- Airtours, First Choice Holidays and Inspirations -- have tried to encourage early bookings and load prices on late bookings for both the 1995 and 1996 summer seasons.
But last month saw Francis Baron, the chief executive of loss-making First Choice, ousted and Inspirations issue a profit warning due to troubles with its Caledonian Airways arm and a setback in tour operations caused by aircraft delays.
The operators' future is also clouded by a government decision last month to refer the industry for a monopolies probe in a row about promoting package holidays through their travel agency arms and offering holiday discounts in exchange for expensive travel insurance.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke's latest budget also jacked up holiday insurance tax from 2.5 to 17.5 percent from April and doubled airport departure tax from next November.
But Crossland said holiday makers seemed unperturbed. ""People are bringing their buying position forward because there were less late deals in the market last year and they are tending to buy the more expensive products as well,"" he said.

2494,"British Telecommunications Plc (BT) might give some ground to U.S. rival AT &amp; T Corp in a quest to win regulatory approval for its $20 billion merger with U.S. carrier MCI Communications Corp, a source familiar with negotiations said on Wednesday.
The proposed merger, the biggest transatlantic deal in history, is being examined by British, American and European regulators. Regulatory clearance from America hinges on whether the British telecom market is deemed to be as open as America's.
AT&amp;T, the world's second biggest telecoms group after Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp, has charged that it does not have the same competitive advantages in Britain as BT will have in the U.S. after its MCI take-over.
The source said BT might look at some of the prices it charges AT&amp;T, which has been active in Britain for some years. The American giant wants BT to lower its transit' costs -- charged for transporting calls from the coast to AT&amp;T's network in cities.
The company also wants what is dubbed ""equal access"" to the British market. This would mean that customers would not have to call special numbers or press other buttons on their telephones before being connected with their chosen telecoms operator.
AT&amp;T complains that customers often forget to dial an access code to get onto its service before making calls, which means that BT gets paid for the call.
While the source said BT was unlikely to give ground on equal access, because it was not cost-effective, he said BT might consider its transit charges. ""It is something that BT may look at,"" the source said, adding: ""I think interconnect costs are always looked at in the UK.""
MCI is America's second biggest international carrier and BT, keen to gain a greater access to the world's biggest telecoms market, wants to buy the 80 percent of MCI it does not already own.
EU sources say that the European Commission is expected to launch a full investigation into the alliance later this week.
The proposed merger, announced last November, was submitted to the Commission for clearance last December, and it has until Thursday to decide whether to clear it following a preliminary investigation -- or launch a deeper probe.
An in-depth probe into whether the deal could violate European fair competition rules could last up to four months.
But BT's EU affairs official Mike Corkerry told Reuters in Brussels: ""We're not picking up any negative vibes about the merger...but there may be some nervousness because it is just so big.""
BT, which along with MCI is holding briefing on Thursday to discuss British and American regulation, expects the deal to be cleared around autumn.

2495,"British Telecommunications' shares, which surged on Monday after weekend confirmation that the telecoms giant had merged with MCI of the U.S., should be valued at around four pounds each, analysts said on Monday.
News of the biggest trans-Atlantic deal in history, linking Britain's dominant telecoms company with America's second largest international carrier, has helped instititions on this side of the Atlantic reassess BT's growth prospects.
By 1306 GMT, almost 56 million shares had exchanged hands as the stock surged 28.5p to 379.5 pence down from an earlier 386p.  
""This deal will force people to look at BT in a new light; look at the international operations; look at the international alliances in Europe; to look at what they could be doing with the Internet because MCI is a big player there,"" said one analyst who asked to be named.
""All these much higher growth and much more exciting elements of BT in which the company has been quietly building value will come much more the fore,"" he added, noting that he was pitching the stock's true value at nearer 4.30 pounds.  
Analysts were split on how much of the share price rise was attributable to the $20 billion MCI merger, which included a 2.2 billion stg special dividend for BT shareholders.
But they said the market had been valuing the 22.6 billion stg group more as a UK utility, with 60 percent of its revenues governed by a regulatory price cap. However, having lined up six European joint-ventures, BT's share of the population in Europe for which they will have a licence could rise to 90 million.  
""In one year's time, only 15 percent of BT's revenues will be covered by a price cap. And, with their European operations getting off the ground, they will have a very substantial business in international markets,"" the analyst added.
Another analyst said that news of the special dividend alone had helped lift BT's shares by as much as 22 pence. Analysts have welcomed the move by BT, which has negligible gearing, to increase borrowing to make it more capital efficient.
""I think its a four-pound stock,"" he said. ""The market did want to see capital restructuring.""
The deal helps lift BT's gearing to around 65 percent.  
""The majority of the share price rise is a function of what is happening to the balance sheet rather than it being an indication that MCI was the right thing to buy,"" he added.
One analyst at brokers Deutsche Morgan Grenfell said that the MCI deal yielded a leverage benefit of about 0.4-0.5 percentage points off the weighted average cost of capital through BT being more highly geared.

2496,"Shareholders in Anglo-American conglomerate Hanson Plc Friday overwhelmingly approved the final part of the group's ambitious four-way split-up.
The approval clears the way for its Energy Group division to be spun off on Monday. About 98 percent of shareholders voted for the plan.
The vote ended an era that saw Hanson, under takeover king Lord Hanson and his late partner Lord White, become a star performer in the 1980s as it grew into one of Britain's largest conglomerates.
But with a stock market that showed its mistrust of conglomerates by sharply marking down their shares, Hanson last January announced that it would tear itself up into separate tobacco, chemicals, energy and building companies.
Energy has two main parts, U.S.-Australian Peabody Coal, the world's largest private coal producer, and Eastern, Britain's fourth-largest electricity generator and distribution business.
Analysts said the company has good growth prospects but is difficult to value because of its diversity.
""I genuinely think if there is a chance of growth this is it, but valuing Energy is difficult because it is a very different animal from other utility stocks,"" said one analyst who asked not to be named.
David Campbell, an analyst at Craig Middleton, said he forecasts earnings growth of around 12 percent annually over the next two years.
Analysts said the potential for using electricity expertise to help Peabody Coal expand in this area in the United States could help Energy's growth.
""Peabody could be the most interesting. It's a clear chance to expand into electricity in the U.S.,"" one said.
Energy has already said it is mulling a string of acquisitions in Britain and North America and has started talks with a U.S. power marketing company.
The company will join a British electricity sector that has been whittled down by take-overs over the last two years as regional electric companies were bought, leaving just two out of an original twelve created at privatissation in 1990.
There has been some speculation Peabody Coal could be spun off from the British electricity interests, but on Friday, Hanson chairman Lord Hanson ruled this out.
""No, I have had enough of demergers (split-ups) and I think (the two) fit very well together,"" he replied to a shareholder question.
The group, which is expected to start with market value of around 2.8 billion pounds ($4.5 billion) and is being sold with 1.4 billion pounds of debt ($2.3 billion), will be large enough to rank among Britain's biggest blue-chip companies and America's Fortune 500. Shares of the company will be listed in London and New York.
The split-up will give shareholders one Energy share for every 10 existing Hanson shares held. Every eight shares in the remaining Hanson group will be consolidated into one new share at the same time.
Hanson's first two split-ups, of Britain's Imperial Tobacco Group Plc and U.S.-listed Millennium Chemicals Inc., took place last October.

2503,"British mutual insurer Norwich Union said on Thursday strong demand had led it to increase the members' offer in next week's flotation to 1.2 billion pounds ($2 billion).
That means some 400 million pounds worth of shares will be clawed back from the public offering, primarily financial institutions, to satisfy members' appetite for extra shares which saw many queuing to beat the June 10 deadline.
Some 800 million pounds worth of shares had originally been set aside to meet members' applications but this proved insufficient as members' rushed to top up their holdings at a 25 pence per share discount to the public offer price.
For Norwich, the flotation will bring to an end more than 200 years as a mutual with policyholders owning the company.
Demutualisation will allow it to separate the group's life operations and thus policyholders' returns from the risks associated with its more volatile and cyclical general insurance business.
It will also strengthen Norwich's financial position and allow the core life business greater investment freedom.
The flotation is likely to value Norwich, which has more than seven million customers, at around 5.5 billion pounds and create Britain's third-largest quoted insurer behind Prudential Corp and Royal &amp; Sun Alliance.
Nearly three million Norwich policyholders will share 1.3 billion free shares in addition to the extra discounted shares.
Norwich still expects the offer price to range between 240 pence and 290 pence per share suggesting large profits for those lucky enough to get extra shares.
Bookmakers City Index are taking bets on a first day closing price of between 335 pence and 345 pence, an immediate profit of at least 70 pence per share.
It would put the value of the minimum 300 free shares with profits members will receive at over 1,000 pounds.
Many will receive far more depending on the value and duration of their policies.
Non-profit policyholders are to receive a flat rate 150 shares.
Institutional demand is a big factor in the likely sharp gains over the offer price.
The two building societies who floated recently -- Halifax and Alliance &amp; Leceister -- saw their share price squeezed higher by financial institutions keen to buy the shares and maintain the weighting of the financial sector in their portfolios.
Like Halifax, Norwich is almost certain to enter the FTSE 100 index of Britain's largest companies.
The public offer, which is made up of the institutional offer, retail offer and employees offer, will be between 1.1 and 1.2 billion pounds following the clawback of the extra shares for members.

2514,"British insurers are jostling for position in preparation for the opening of the potentially lucrative Indian market to foreign companies for the first time in over two decades.
On Monday Prudential Corp became the latest company to team up with an Indian partner, announcing plans to explore opportunities in life insurance with Industrial Credit and Investment Corp of India.
The Indian government is expected to outline rules governing participation in the health insurance and pensions industries soon, following February's budget announcement that private and foreign investors would be allowed into the sectors through joint ventures with its two state-run monopolies.
The General Insurance Corp (GIC) and the Life Insurance Corp (LIC) have controlled the industry since life insurance was nationalised in 1956 and general insurance in 1972.
The budget has been a hostage to a political crisis and change of prime minister in recent weeks, but new Indian leader Inder Kumar Gujral has indicated he is keen to push the February budget through parliament quickly.
Participation is initially to be limited to firms with majority Indian ownership but attracted by the possibility of wider reform, British firms have been working hard to forge links with Indian companies.
Many have been visiting India since the early 1990s, well in advance of the report of the government's Malhotra committee which proposed reform.
For many, such as the Pru whose Indian operations were its largest overseas before nationalisation, it will be a return to a market with which historical ties are strong.
Others looking for a foothold in India include Commercial Union which has formed a joint venture for general insurance with the Hindustan Times, part of the KK Birla Group.
Eagle Star, part of B.A.T, has established links with the Indian Tobacco Co, mutually-owned Standard Life with Housing Development Finance Corp, General Accident with the Bombay-based Wadia group, Guardian Royal Exchange with the Peerless Group and Legal &amp; General with SK Modi Group. Royal &amp; Sun have a joint venture with DCM Shriram Consolidated.
Industry analysts expect it to take between six and eight months to pass the necessary legislation and award licenses for the health insurance sector.
Successful applicants are expected to begin operating sometime in 1998.
But how long it takes to liberalise other areas of insurance is open to question.
""I suspect the coalition government is going to hamstring decision-making. I don't see the general insurance market opening up for two or three years. As far as getting licences is concerned we're hostages to the political situation which is volatile,"" said one British insurance executive.
Government plans, an extension of free-market reforms begun in 1991, have run into opposition from Indian labour unions and parties across the political spectrum.
But fears of a repatriation of funds by foreign companies are unfounded according to a spokesman for one insurance company.
""Insurers try to match liabilities with the funds they have in a country,"" he said, adding that worries firms would compete for profitable sectors and ignore loss-makers were also misguided.
""The example of the health sector is ample proof that we're willing to enter what is generally believed to be a loss-making sector, turn it around and make it profitable.""
Health insurance cover in India is limited compared to the rest of the world and penetration low.
Per capita spending on insurance premiums of around $5 is among the lowest anywhere and compares with $30 in Thailand and $407 in Taiwan according to Eagle Star figures.
But its potential is enormous. The middle class is estimated at between 250 and 300 million people and the finance ministry estimates the insurance industry is growing at around 11 percent annually. ($ = 0.612 British Pounds)

2516,"Britain's Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS) breathed a sigh of relief on Thursday as the ambitious takeover bid led by 31-year-old Andrew Regan crumbled in a flurry of legal writs.
But the company's satisfaction at seeing off Regan may be tempered by the realisation that its battle for independence may have only just begun.
While the chances of Regan ever succeeding in his bold attempt to buy the group and sell off its disparate parts were probably always slim, the move has alerted many in the industry to the underlying and, some say, under-utilised CWS assets.
The view among banking observers was that CWS remains in play whatever the outcome of the Regan episode.
""It's not the end of saga. It may be the end of Regan's offer but that's not the same thing. Regan's done a lot of other people's work for them,"" commented one banking source.
In favour of its hopes of staying independent, CWS boasts a convoluted ownership and voting structure which complicates any hostile takeover attempt.
But Regan, who had planned to mount a bid approach through a unit of his Lanica Trust Plc, has identified both a wealth of underperforming assets and possible purchasers in the event of any break-up, and put in place the financing to back it.
It was not the deal that ultimately foundered, but doubts about Regan himself that allowed CWS to claim victory in what may prove to be only round one of its fight for independence.
Last week, the group turned in a 10 million pound ($16.2 million) fall in profits for the year before tax and distribution to its members of 68.2 million pounds on flat sales of around three billion pounds.
A 21 percent rise in trading profits in its banking arm was more than offset by falls in its trading operations.
Regan planned a 1.2 billion pound offer for CWS through a company specially set up for the purpose - Galileo Group - intending to sell off CWS businesses which include supermarkets, banking, insurance as well as opticians, chemists and funeral parlours.
Allied Irish Banks confirmed it was among those interested in Co-op businesses, and supermarket chain J.Sainsbury was also reported to be among those lining up to purchase the assets.
The plans foundered amid allegations of financial irregularities regarding an earlier deal Regan had been involved in concerning a food supply agreement with the CWS and Hobson Plc, which was run by Regan at that time.
CWS has launched criminal proceedings against Regan, partner David Lyons and suspended CWS employee Allan Green relating to confidential documents allegedly stolen by Green.
It is also suing Regan's banking advisor Hambros and law firm Travers Smith Braithwaite.
According to banking sources, Regan's decision to ditch his bid may have been precipitated by the threat that his financial backers were about to pull out.
Japanese bank Nomura which was financing it was understood to be very unhappy about the allegations surrounding Regan and had written to Hambros on Wednesday demanding a full explanation of them by nine o'clock Thursday morning.
But Nomura had not been satisfied by the response it had received according to the industry sources and was reviewing its position when Regan announced he was dropping his bid.
A spokesman for Nomura declined to comment. ($ = 0.615 British Pounds)

2518,"British composite insurer Commercial Union Plc on Wednesday reported a strong rise in first quarter profits, helped by a sharp fall in U.S. weather claims.
Pre-tax operating profits rose to 102 million pounds ($166.4 million), up from 83 million last year.
The results were in line with expectations but the shares lost ground after a recent good run.
Forecasts were likely to be left largely unchanged, analysts said, and by mid-afternoon Commercial Union shares had slipped 13-1/2 pence to 736p.
The strength of the pound held back headline figures and, excluding the impact of sterling, profits advanced 46 percent. On the same basis profits and new business sales in the group's life business rose 25 percent.
General insurance profits increased to 67 million pounds, up three million pounds over 1996 despite a reduction in profits in Britain due to increased competition.
The company is set to unveil details of its strategy for the UK general insurance business next month.
A fall in weather losses helped U.S. results while France and Australia also saw profit increases.
Weather claims in the U.S. fell 23 million pounds over the period to six million pounds after the milder winter.
In Britain, weather costs were broadly flat.
But a dry start to the year and increased turnover in the housing market combined to push up subsidence costs.
Claims notifications were up 11 percent while costs increased to 11 million pounds from seven million pounds.
Echoing comments made by General Accident which reported on Tuesday, Commercial Union said British general insurance rates remained competitive though there was evidence of firming in certain classes of business, particularly motor.
U.S. general insurance was also competitive and average rate increases there had broadly matched inflation.
France was seeing rises in certain classes but areas such as motor cover were becoming more difficult, the company said.
Life profits over the quarter increased to 62 million pounds from 58 million pounds last year, with strong performances from the UK, the Netherlands and France.
Excluding the impact of exchange rates, new life, pensions and investment sales rose by 25 percent.
With the acquisition of 73 percent of French life assurer Societe d'Epargne Viagere (SEV) in April, life operations now account for around 50 percent of total group premium income.
The growth of the life business, part of a long-standing strategy, is set to continue for the foreseeable future.
The company hopes to take advantage of future changes in welfare provision in Britain and continental Europe.
Demographic changes putting pressure on spending on state pensions, sickness and accident benefits is expected to provide a growing number of opportunities for private providers in years to come.
Growth is likely to be organic but the company remains open-minded about acquisitions.
""If a suitable opportunity arose we would certainly consider it... but we're not actively seeking acquisitions,"" said finance director Peter Foster.
Sales at the company's French life operations were expected to remain dull for the rest of this year and possibly early into 1998 as the reorganisation of the sales force continued.
First quarter new sales figure in France, where new single premium business fell 16 percent, disappointed many.
The reorganisation, a rise in interest rates and strong 1996 first quarter comparisons were among the factors blamed for the shortfall.
Commercial union continues to eye further opportunities in eastern Europe after the success of its Polish operations and will start writing business in the Czech Republic later this year. ($ = 0.613 British Pounds)

2522,"The Lloyd's insurance market's ""annual venture"" - where syndicates are formed anew every year - has been criticised as costly and damaging to competitiveness in a report by accountants KPMG published on Friday.
The report will form part of the submission by the Lloyd's Corporate Capital Association (LCCA) to the Lloyd's Syndicate Structure working party which is weighing the pros and cons of different capital structures for syndicates.
But it will also be seen as another attack on the position of unlimited liability Names, the traditional backers of the 300 year-old insurance market, who fear they are being eased out of the market in favour of corporate investors.
Only last month, Lloyd's put forward proposals to raise the amount of capital Names must pledge to back their underwriting activities.
That move is likely to reduce further the number of Names at Lloyd's, already at 20-year lows.
Corporate capital, first introduced in 1994, now accounts for 44 percent of the market's total capacity.
KPMG puts the direct costs of the annual venture at 117 million pounds ($190 million) in an average year, more than 10 percent of the underwriting profits of the insurance market in the 1994 year of account.
In addition, it argues that the indirect costs involved clearly inhibit Lloyd's syndicates in critical areas such as long-term planning, capital investment and reinsurance purchasing.
This, it says, will increasingly restrict Lloyd's competitiveness internationally in areas such as the provision of multi-year insurance products and compliance with overseas regulatory standards.
KPMG suggests that 58 million pounds could be saved by the abolition of members' agents who represent Names' interests. The Corporation of Lloyd's annual costs could be reduced by around 41 million pounds, it says.
Antony Haynes, chairman of the LCCA which represents corporate investors, said the KPMG report ""speaks for itself.""
""Both traditional names and corporate capital providers are seeing a substantial part of their underwriting returns being eroded by a market practice of the annual venture...,"" Haynes said.
But Robert Miller, spokesman for the Association of Lloyd's Members (ALM) which represents around 8,000 Names, rejected the report's conclusions.
""We are doubtful about the apportionment of the costs. Secondly what it has completely failed to take into account is that the Names significantly pay for the costs of the annual venture,"" said Miller.
Names were willing to pay for the annual venture, he argued, because it allowed them to receive an income stream unrelated to other investments such as shares and to diversify their portfolios.
The Lloyd's syndicate structure working party is due to publish its conclusions soon.
It is one of a number set up to examine the key strategic issues facing Lloyd's which will report by the end of May.
The findings will be pulled together to develop the blueprint for the market's new business plan, expected to be published in June or July.
Supporters of the present system argue that a shift to corporate capital will damage the flexibility and entrepreneurial spirit of the Lloyd's market.
ALM has commissioned its own independent study on the way capital is provided to Lloyd's syndicates which will provide the basis of its submission to the working party. ($ = 0.615 British Pounds)

Norwich is to raise 1.75 billion pounds ($2.9 billion) of fresh capital in the offering and up to a further 670 million pounds to fund cash payments to its half million overseas members.
The company has also increased its estimate of the price of the new shares.
They are now expected to be sold at between 240 pence and 290 pence. The group's brokers Kleinwort Benson had previously given a guide price of between 220 pence and 265 pence.
Members of the insurance group, Britain's third largest with seven million customers worldwide, are to be offered extra shares at a fixed discount of 25 pence.
A member is someone who holds a Norwich life insurance, pension or annuity policy. Holders of non-life policies such as house contents or car insurance do not qualify.
Members will also receive around 1.3 billion free shares worth around 3.4 billion pounds under flotation plans already announced.
Under the new forecasts, the value of the 300 shares minimum allocation to with-profits policyholders will increase by at least 60 pounds and could be worth as much as 870 pounds.
Members will receive additional shares based on the value and length of time they have held their policies.
The company said it expected to be valued at between 4.9 and 5.6 billion pounds on flotation which would put it in the FTSE 100 index of Britain's largest quoted companies.
Norwich chairman George Paul said the company was keen to encourage members to continue to participate in the future of the group.
""I hope that they will take advantage of this opportunity to buy further shares at a 25p discount,"" said Paul.
Alan Bridgewater, Norwich's chief executive, said they were expecting widespread interest in the offer.
Norwich members wishing to take part in the public offering will have to apply for a minimum of 400 pounds worth of shares. There will be an upper ceiling on applications by members of 100,000 pounds.
At least 800 million pounds worth of shares have been reserved to meet applications from members. This may be increased by clawing back 400 million pounds worth of shares from the public offering in the event of strong demand.

2536,"Britain on Friday launched a new watchdog for the country's 200,000 occupational pension schemes.
Called the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority (OPRA), the body was set up in the wake of the pension scandal surrounding publishing mogul the late Robert Maxwell.
The independent watchdog, which will be based in Brighton on the English south coast and starts operations on Monday, was established under the Pensions Act 1995 drawn up in the wake of the Maxwell pensions scandal of 1991.
The new act comes into force on April 6 and the reforms are designed to reinforce the most important parts of existing British pensions law.
OPRA chief executive Caroline Johnston said it would be naive to say that one could guarantee that there could not be a recurrence of the Maxwell situation when more than 400 million pounds ($655 million) went missing, but she expressed confidence that it would be ""much less likely"" in the future.
OPRA will ensure that occupational schemes, which control some 500 billion pounds of assets, abide by the new rules and are adequately funded to cover members' pensions.
Its remit is to see that the interests of Britain's 12 million members of company pension schemes are protected and that occupational pension schemes comply with the law.
It will have powers to investigate suspected breaches of the law and take legal, disciplinary or regulatory action against employers or trustees where breaches are found.
Under the Pensions Act legislation, it will have the power to investigate trustees, search company offices and seize documents.
Actuaries and auditors will be under a new statutory duty to report clients if they find rules being breached.
In the event of any wrongdoing, OPRA will be able to fine trustees, remove them from their posts, disqualify them and, if necessary, replace them with their own nominees.
It can also wind up schemes and apply for injunctions to prevent the misuse of pension scheme assets.
OPRA chairman John Hayes promised the body would take a pragmatic approach and did not necessarily expect schemes to be in a position to comply with every aspect of the new Pensions Act from day one.
""We will deal with cases on merit...and be sensitive but tough,"" Hayes said.
And while it plans to make use of publicity to encourage compliance, OPRA says it will not be heavy handed with small-mistakes that do not involve dishonesty or a deliberate ignoring of the rules.
The new regime will rely heavily on tip-offs and has set up a hotline to enable employees and pensioners to pass on information -- anonymously if they wish.

No decision has yet been reached about where Lloyd's will fit into the new regulatory regime which will see the existing system of self-regulatory organisations (SROs) swept away and replaced by a Securities and Investments Board (SIB) with tougher new powers and an extended remit.
Only last week the insurance market announced it favoured giving up 300 years of self regulation for supervision by an external authority, specifically the SIB.
A Treasury spokesman described the Labour government as ""sympathetic"" to the proposals but said that no decision had yet been taken.
""There are a number of areas - Lloyds, building societies, insurance more generally - which are still under discussion as to how they are going to be handled under these new arrangements. We'll have to wait to see how those discussions proceed,"" said the spokesman.
Lloyd's has yet to talk to the government about its proposals which would bring it more into line with other regulated markets and narrow the gap in treatment between it and insurance companies.
Under the plans the Council would retain day-to-day responsibility for regulation but be subject to external oversight by the SIB and Department of Trade and Industry.
The changes would need legislation to be brought forward to amend both the Insurance Companies Acts and the Financial Services Act.
The government is likely to want all parties involved to take part in discussions and a Lloyd's spokesman said it would be ""happy to do so"".

That would value the shares at 143 pence each, a premium of 63 percent over the day's opening price, Heath said shortly after the close of the stock market.
Management involved in the possible offer include group chief executive John Mackenzie Green, according to a source close to the talks.
Meanwhile, non-executive directors are considering the approach.
Over three million shares changed hands in the course of the day ahead of the late afternoon announcement. It was the unusually high stock activity which forced the company to release the news early, the source said.
The success of a bid hinges on fund management group PDFM, which owns 22 percent of Heath, Hambros, which holds 13 percent, Fidelity, with a 13 percent stake and Equitable Life with just under five percent.
In the past Heath was an underwriter, broker and computer services business.
The strategy over the last five years has been to sell underwriting businesses and demerge computer services leaving a pure, medium sized broker in the hope of making the company more attractive to investors.
Over the last year, however, the whole sector has been depressed with market conditions difficult as intense competition squeezed margins.
""Management launched a major reorganisation but the argument is that its very difficult to carry out a restructuring in the full glare of the market place,"" said the source.

Speaking at his last annual meeting as chairman, Rowland also promised there would be no move to do away with the practice in which syndicates are reformed each year despite criticisms from some managing agents that it is out-of date and expensive.
But he threw his support behind recent changes in the market which have seen members move away from unlimited to limited liability.
On retirement, said Rowland, he would become a limited liability member of Lloyd's.
""Unlimited personal liability has been shown to mean exactly what it says, and I no longer believe that the substantial advantages of that method of trading should blind us to the reality of its possible consequences for the individual,"" he said.
New trading structures with continuous capital, allowing the commitment of resources for the long-term development of underwriting businesses, may prove the better route, said Rowland.
Unless it embraces change, Lloyd's will see a steady decline in its fortunes, he warned.
The annual reforming of syndicates and the reinsurance of outstanding claims when the syndicate year closed -- known as reinsurance to close -- had appeared to work admirably until the 8 billion pounds ($13 billion) in losses between 1988 and 1992 that at one point threatened to destroy Lloyd's.
Rowland argued it would never again be possible to reinsure to close an annual account without remembering the vulnerabilty of the system.
Critics have increasingly questioned the viability of the annual system of raising capital for Lloyd's, which they say is both costly and prevents long-term planning.
Only a few days ago, the outspoken former chairman of Lloyd's, Robert Hiscox, described it as an ""anachronistic absurdity"" and attacked the complexity of the current capital structure where Names and corporate capital co-exist.
There is increasing tension at Lloyd's between Names, whose assets largely back the market on an unlimited basis and limited liability corporate capital, first introduced in 1994.
These tensions will be resolved by market forces, promised Rowland.

2552,"The stock of Apple Computer Inc. rose in heavy trading Thursday on a report that the chairman of software company Oracle Corp. said once again he was interested in buying the troubled computer maker.
Larry Ellison, Oracle chairman, told the San Jose Mercury News Wednesday that he was forming an investor group to raise $1 billion to buy a majority stake in Apple.
Ellison, a flamboyant software billionaire, has said since April 1995 that he would like to buy Apple with his own money, partly to prevent Microsoft Corp. from dominating the computer industry.
Based on its stock price, Apple is worth $2.17 billion. Ellison's stake in Oracle is worth about $6 billion.
Apple rose $2.25 to $19, while Oracle fell $1.125 to $39.375 on Nasdaq, where both stocks were among the most active issues in late trading.
Ellison told the newspaper he was publicly reasserting his interest in buying Apple partly to gauge investor support in the next few days. Based on the reaction, he will decide soon whether to make a bid.
Previously, he has said he approached unidentified big investors about a joint bid. He also has mulled the idea with his friend Steve Jobs, the Apple co-founder who was kicked out of the company in 1985 and returned in December as a part-time advisor to Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio.
Ellison could not be reached for comment. Katie Cotton, Apple spokeswoman, said the Cupertino, Calif.-based company had no comments about Ellison.
Wall Street analysts said they doubted Ellison actually would attempt to buy Apple because he has not taken any concrete steps in the two years that he has expressed an interest.
""The deal doesn't make sense for (any outside investor) to take him up on it,"" said David Wu, analyst at investment bank ABN Ambro Chicago Corp.
Still, Ellison's comments should not be dismissed, some analysts said.
""It would be a mistake to analyse this as a pure business issue, as there is substantial ego involved,"" said Paul Saffo, a tracker of Apple and Ellison and a research fellow at Institute for the Future, a Silicon Valley think tank.
Ellison, the third-richest software tycoon behind Microsoft co-founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen, is intent on slowing Microsoft's dominance of the software industry, he has said in recent interviews. Apple, with its huge following of Macintosh fans, could be a key weapon.
Saffo also said Jobs, since returning to Apple late last year, has been very influential in trimming the company, and could be ""sprucing up"" Apple for an acquisition.
Jobs recently became a member of the Apple board following Apple's $400 million acquisition of his Next Software Inc.
Apple has suffered declining market share for its famous brand of easy-to-use computers and endured several rounds of restructuring in recent years. The stock has languished in the mid-teens since early January and is at a 10-year low.
In mid-March, the company said it planned to discontinue several product lines and lay off 4,000 employees, or one-third of its staff, in its latest bid to slash costs and turn the company around.

2557,"Informix Corp. , facing plunging sales of its database software products, plans to raise cash and is considering refinancing its leases to keep its operations going at current levels, the company said in filings with federal regulators.
(Clarifies that company has yet to decide whether to refinance its leases).
The struggling database software company plans to raise capital to offset upcoming losses from operations, and to shore up its shrinking cash supply, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Informix also is considering arranging for the refinancing of leases on parcels of land in Santa Clara, Calif., where it intended to build new corporate headquarters.
""While the company believes it will acquire the necessary financing, there can be no assurance that such financing will be available,"" Informix said in the filing. ""The company's failure to raise working capital would have adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.""
Informix, based in Menlo Park, Calif., is the second-largest publisher of database software, the computer programmes that let companies store huge libraries of vital information on computer networks.
Earlier this year, the company made a huge bet on a jazzy new database product, dubbed Universal Server, aimed at customers in just-emerging multimedia markets.
The bet, Informix executives have said, turned out to be misplaced. By focusing its marketing on the new product, Informix neglected its older, better-selling products.
It reported a first-quarter loss of $140.1 million, or 93 cents, on revenue of $133.7 million. Sales declined 34 percent in the first quarter.
The huge loss slashed Informix's cash supply in half to $120.6 million from $261 million, the company said. Part of the decline also was due to a $61.5 million cash deposit with Banque Nationale de Paris, which provided the financing for the Santa Clara land.
Informix also needs the money to carry on its plan to build 14 Information Superstores, a chain of showrooms where the company plans to demostrate the capabilities of its programmes to potential customers.
Informix's financial trouble also has raised speculation that the company is a candidate for an acquisition by a larger software vendor, possibly Computer Associates International Inc. or Netscape Communications Corp., analysts said.
Based on the speculation, Informix shares jumped $2.19, or 24 percent, to $11.375 on trading of 17.6 million shares on Nasdaq, where it was the most active issue.

2566,"Apple Computer Inc. stock rose Thursday on renewed speculation that the troubled computer maker was trying to sell itself to a bigger company.
The stock of the Cupertino, Calif., company gained 87.5 cents to $18.875 on trading of 4.9 million shares, making it one of the most active issues on the Nasdaq. Earlier, the stock traded as high as $19.125.
On Wednesday, Saudi billionaire Prince al-Waleed bin Talal revealed he bought a 5 percent stake in Apple for $115 million because he expects the company to turn itself around.
Last week, software billionaire Larry Ellison, chairman of Oracle Corp., said he intended to form an investor group to try to buy a majority stake in Apple, take control of the company and revamp it with a new management team.
The New York Times, citing unnamed Apple sources, also reported Thursday that Apple was actively seeking to sell itself and has approached high-performance computer maker Sun Microsystems Inc. again. Sun tried to buy Apple in late 1995, but negotiations fell apart over price.
An Apple spokeswomen declined to comment about the speculation. Sun Chief Executive Scott McNealy also declined to comment about the rumours, ""no matter how accurate or silly they may be.""
Mulling takeover bids is nothing new at Apple. In addition to Sun, Apple negotiated with International Business Machines Corp. about a merger two years ago. IBM also demurred over price.
Former high-level Apple executives who keep close contact with the company said Thursday they have not heard of any recent moves by Apple to approach suitors.
One former executive said, however, that increasing pressure from investors -- who hold stock near a 10-year low -- may make Chairman Gilbert Amelio more receptive to any takeover proposal that might come along.
Trouble is, none might come along, analysts said.
""It's always possible, but we're not putting a lot of weight into it,"" said Peter Andrews, analyst at brokerage AG Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
Even though Apple still has a huge following of Macintosh users, the company will not be able to stop its sales from falling for at least another year, making it an unattractive buyout, analysts said.
In the past five quarters, Apple has reported financial losses of close to $1 billion and has had two rounds of job cuts totalling 5,400. Despite the massive expense reductions, the company does not expect to report a profit until the September quarter.
Company executives have told investors they expect revenue for the year to fall about 20 percent to $8 billion.
The most likely suitor for now is Ellison, the flamboyant head of Oracle who has publicly criticised Amelio for failing to turn the company around.
Ellison set up a World Wide Web site last week to solicit e-mail from investors to gauge support (http://www.us.oracle.com/corporate/press/html/apple.html). Depending on the response, he would launch a bid.
A spokesman for Ellison said it was too early for him to comment on the results. Ellison could not be reached immediately for comment.
Some investors said they were not impressed by Ellison's offer.
Richard Ash, a private investor who owns 3,000 Apple shares, said he would not sell his stock to Ellison because he was not offering a premium over the current stock price.

2569,"Technology stocks jumped Wednesday amid investor optimism that major computer, software and chip companies will report solid earnings.
Technology stocks also responded to a slew of optimistic investment recommendations from analysts, who have said in recent days that the shares are undervalued.
""A number of people, including yours truly, believe it's time to start nibbling again on the stocks that form the technology infrastructure,"" said Bruce Lupatkin, director of research at investment bank Hambrecht &amp; Quist Group Inc. in San Francisco.
The month-long sharp decline of stocks like Cisco Systems Inc., Netscape Communications Corp. and Oracle Corp. represents a buying opportunity, Lupatkin said.
Cisco, the world's biggest network equipment maker, jumped $4.50 to $52.375 on Nasdaq trading of 18 million shares, making the issue the most active in U.S. markets.
Intel Corp., the world's biggest computer chipmaker, rose $7.375 to $140.625. Microsoft Corp., the biggest PC software company, gained $3.94 to $94.25. And Oracle, the No. 1 database software company, rose $1.50 to $40.50.
Analysts have said in recent weeks that technology sales seem to be slowing because of the strengthening dollar, weak sales in Europe and Japan and slow consumer sales. Stocks like Intel, Cisco and 3Com Corp. slumped on those expectations.
But some stocks slumped too far.
On Tuesday, John Skeen and Thomas Thornhill, the influential directors of research at Montgomery Securities Inc., said they believe the recent lows in stocks like Cisco, Oracle and Intel are ""buying opportunities.""
Based on Cisco's low share price and earnings prospect, the stock's rating was raised on Wednesday to a ""buy"" at Josephthal Lyon &amp; Ross in New York.
""We think the stock is extremely undervalued at these levels,"" said Larry Rice, Josephthal's director of research.
Other stocks that gained Wednesday include 3Com, up $2.125 to $35.50; Dell Computer Corp., up $3.94 to $71.44; and Micron Technology Inc. up $2.125 to $40.875.
Some analysts said, however, the one-day rally might not last.
""It's going to be volatile for a while, I think,"" said John Rohal, managing director at Robertson, Stephens &amp; Co. in San Francisco. Investors likely will wait until the second half of the year to gauge earnings performances before committing to technology stocks again, he said.

2581,"Computer network equipment maker 3Com Corp. Thursday reported a 17 percent rise in third-quarter profits, an unusually small rate for the company.
3Com executives told investors, however, they expect business to pick up again in the fourth quarter and said that, contrary to fears among Wall Street investors, the industry does not face an extracted slowdown.
""We do not expect that the demand weakness we saw in December will recur,"" said Eric Benhamou, 3Com chief executive. ""The fundamentals of the industry remain very strong and the potential remains for the industry to sustain growth rates in the 30 to 50-percent range in the coming years.""
3Com, the second-biggest maker of networking equipment after Cisco Systems Inc., said net income rose to $87.6 million, or 47 cents a share, from $74.6 million, or 42 cents, in the same quarter a year ago.
The company announced last month it was acquiring consumer computer modem giant U.S. Robotics Corp. in a stock deal valued at $7.3 billion.
Wall Street, after having been warned a month ago by executives that the company faced a difficult quarter, expected 3Com to earn 46 cents a share, according to a recent survey by First Call.
Revenue for the quarter ended Feb. 28 rose 30 percent to $786.8 million from $606 million a year ago.
3Com makes electronic devices that send information through computer networks. In December, the company had unusually weak sales because of falling product prices and aggressive moves by competitors Cisco and Intel Corp.
The warning set off a month-long slide of networking stocks and spurred concerns that the industry segment had seen its best days. Since the warning, 3Com's shares have lost more than half their value in seven weeks.
3Com shares on Thursday closed up $1.44 at $33.63.
""It looks like the worst is behind them, although it could take at least a quarter or two for them to get things back in line,"" said Noel Lindsey, analyst at investment bank Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Inc. in San Francisco.
Benhamou's positive remarks also likely will boost 3Com's stock Friday, Lindsey said.
About 45 percent of 3Com's revenue comes from the sale of networking adapter cards, the graham-wafer-sized devices that plug into PCs to connect them to networks. 3Com said adapter card revenue rose 39 percent in the third quarter to $346.3 million.
3Com also sells switches and hubs, the devices that shuffle information through networks. Sales of these system products rose 24 percent to $432.6 million.
Benhamou said the company is bringing expenses in line with revenue. He also said strong sales throughout Asia is offsetting weakness in Japan. Similarly, strong British sales are mitigating weak sales in Germany, he said.
""During the quarter, we saw strong demand for our high-end"" network equipment, 3Com Chairman Eric Benhamou said in a statement, ""and the number of multimillion-dollar orders we received from large accounts has never been greater.""
""At the same time, our industry is in the midst of many important transitions,"" Benhamou added, citing the adoption of higher-speed technologies, new methods for directing network traffic and pricing and distribution increasingly based on volume sales.
He said that as a result of these changes, 3Com's results in the latest quarter reflected increased price competition and a pause in industry demand as corporate networking customers and network service providers assess how to maximize their investments in computer networks.
But he added the changes were ""positive for 3Com and the industry in the long run.""
The acquisition of U.S. Robotics, the leading worldwide maker of modems for the consumer market, will create a company with annual revenues topping $5 billion.
Under terms of the agreement, each share of Skokie, Ill.-based U.S. Robotics will be exchanged for 1.75 shares of 3Com stock.

2582,"Advanced Micro Devices Inc., in a bid to take on computer chip giant Intel Corp.,  on Wednesday began shipping its K6 microprocessor.
AMD, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., said its K6 microprocessor works faster than Intel's top-of-the-line Pentium Pro chip, is 25 percent cheaper than comparable Intel offerings and is easier to design a PC around.
For the first time in its corporate history, AMD is a strong alternative for the latest technology to Intel, the world's biggest semiconductor company, said Jerry Sanders, AMD's chairman.
""It's the good guys vs. the bad guys,"" Sanders said in a presentation to investors and reporters. ""It's the Return of the Jedi. We're the Jedi.""
AMD makes microprocessors, the chips that handle the main calculations of a personal computer.
Until now, AMD's chips have been about three years behind in technology from what Intel has offered. The K6, using technology gained from the 1995 acquisition of chip designer Nexgen Inc., crunches numbers just as fast or slightly faster than Intel's Pentium, analysts said.
With the K6, AMD hopes to land several big computer companies as customers.
""There is a growing perception that the Intel monoply is getting broken up,"" said Krishna Shankar, semiconductor analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. ""If I were a PC maker I would want two healthy competitors.""
No PC manufacturer, however, has yet committed to using the K6 in its machines. At the AMD presentation, Sanders did not name any K6 customers, as some analysts had expected.
Sanders said PC makers will begin to announce K6-based machines in the next 60 days.
""The single most important task for us right now is to convince the biggest PC players in the top tiers,"" he said.
AMD's stock fell 12.5 cents to $39.50 and was the most active on the New York Stock Exchange. Intel fell $2.31 to $137 on Nasdaq.
Even though AMD did not name any customers, most analysts expect the company to ship at least 2 million K6 chips by the end of the year.
Based largely on the demand for the K6, the worldwide market for non-Intel microprocessors will triple in 1997 to $2.4 billion from $722 million in 1996, market researcher Dataquest said.

2594,"Versant Object Technology Corp, a database software company, expects to do more business with MCI Communications Corp despite a stalled project last summer, Versant's chief executive said.
""We anticipate ongoing business from MCI,"" said David Banks, CEO of Versant, based in Menlo Park, Calif. ""They are still a customer of ours. They are using our licenses in existing projects and there are new projects on the horizon.""  
A lot is riding on Versant's relationship with MCI. Ever since the long-distance phone company put a major project to revamp its billing system on hold, Versant's stock has been in a funk.
Versant was supplying MCI with some of the fundamental software for the project. So when MCI last summer halted work to re-evaluate the project, code-named Horizon, investors assumed the worse about Versant and guessed the software company was the cause of the snafu, analysts said.  
Versant's stock plummeted from a high of 28-3/8 in late November to as low as 8 three weeks ago. On Tuesday, Versant was unchanged at 14-3/4.
In 1996, Versant's sales of software to MCI totaled about $4.8 million, or about 26 percent of the $18.4 million reported for the year.
""There have been rumors going around Wall Street implying that the relationship between MCI and Versant went sour,"" said James Mendelson, an analyst at brokerage SoundView Financial. ""I don't believe Versant was at fault.""  
Banks said he could not discuss the technical details of Horizon, or why it was halted, because of a confidentiality contract with MCI. An MCI spokesman said the company simply decided to change the goals of the project, and would not comment about Versant's performance.
But analysts said MCI's actions speak louder than words. Even though MCI never finished Horizon, MCI paid Versant all the money the software company was due.
In June, MCI placed a $3.9 million order for Versant software to revamp its billing system. In September, MCI told Versant that it was re-evaluating the project. So Versant decided not to recognize revenue from the project in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, MCI renegotiated terms of the contract with Versant and paid the software company $4.4 million.
""MCI met all their financial obligations,"" Banks said. MCI also is still using Versant software, but Banks declined to say how much more revenue his company would receive from MCI.
Mendelson said he expects Versant's revenue to nearly double in 1997 to $30 million as the company finds new customers outside of the telecommunications industry.

2595,"Apple Computer Inc. will lay off more employees this year as part of its plan to return to profitabilty by 1998, an Apple spokesman said Friday.
The fourth-biggest U.S. maker of personal computers also is taking a closer look at unprofitable product lines with an eye at discontinuing them, said David Harrah, Apple's corporate spokesman.
As first reported in USA Today, the upcoming round of job cuts is part of Apple's plan to slash up to 20 percent of its costs to compensate for falling revenue. The company, based in Cupertino, Calif., has not yet determined how many it will fire, Harrah said.
Apple dismissed about 1,300 people last year as part of a broad corporate restructuring programme.
Earlier this month the company said it would launch another restructuring programme aimed at cutting another $400 million in costs. At the time Apple executives said additional layoffs were possible but they provided few details.
On Friday, Harrah confirmed layoffs will be part of the plan.
""There will be layoffs as part of a larger restructuring,"" Harrah said. ""We are taking a look at the entire business"" including the possibility of discontinuing lines such as the handheld Newton computer and the Pippin home entertainment console.
Abandoning Newton and Pippin would mark a return to Apple's core business of focusing on traditional PC products rather than other forms of technology. It would also signal a departure from the vision of former Apple Chief Executive John Sculley who pushed for the Newton before he was fired in 1993.
The move comes weeks after Apple reported a fiscal first quarter loss of $120 million on a sharp decline in sales. The struggling computer maker recently warned it does not expect to return to profitability until September, six months later than originally scheduled.
Apple's troubles are a setback to Chairman Gilbert Amelio's plan to stanch Apple's losses by 1997. Under his plan, Apple aims to reduce its costs so it can break even at $8 billion in annual sales.
Apple executives have blamed weaker-than-expected sales of the company's consumer-oriented personal computers for the decline in revenues.
To bolster sales, Apple on Friday said it cut price cuts on many of its product lines by as much as 27 percent. The company slashed prices of its consumer-oriented Performa machines, its high-end Power Macintoshes and its business-oriented Workgroup Servers.
For example, the price of the Power Macintosh 9500/200, a machine popular with graphic artists, was slashed to about $3,200 from $4,200.

2602,"The United States on Friday said it would grant 10-year multiple-entry visas to holders of Hong Kong passports issued after China takes back the territory, clearing a major worry here about travel rights.
U.S. Consul-General Richard Boucher said holders of future Hong Kong passports would get the same visa treatment now enjoyed by holders of Hong Kong British travel documents.
""We intend to issue maximum validity visas for the United States for people with the new Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) passport,"" Boucher told reporters.
The decision was a milestone in international recognition of the future SAR passport and removed a question mark hanging over Hong Kong as China prepares to resume sovereignty at midnight on June 30, ending 156 years of British colonial rule.
From July 1, the territory of 6.4 million people will become a Special Administrative Region of China, and winning easy travel access to major destinations is viewed as a barometer of confidence in the territory's future prospects.
Easy travel rights are also seen as key to maintaining Hong Kong's position as an international business and tourism centre.
So far, nine countries -- Britain, Singapore, Canada, the Philippines, Western Samoa, Trinidad and Tobago, Namibia, Benin, and San Marino -- have gone further to grant full visa-free entry for SAR passports, but other nations have hesitated.
Japan, for example, has said it will treat SAR passports more favourably than Chinese passports, but it has not yet revealed details.
Boucher said the same visa application procedures and conditions for approval as now would apply after the handover for Hong Kong people wishing to visit the United States.
""The same application procedures, the same forms, the same facilities will apply...the requirements are exactly the same. The decisions on yes or no are exactly the same,"" he said.
Hong Kong Director of Immigration Regina Ip welcomed Washington's decision and saw it as a confidence booster.
""Absolutely, this will be a very useful confidence booster. So far, nine countries will give visa-free treatment to Hong Kong SAR passports...a few more are considering and we will probably have a lot more before July 1,"" she said.
In return, U.S. citizens would be accorded the same visa-free entry privilege which they now enjoy, she said.
""Current arrangements are that they may do so without a visa for visits up to one month. The Hong Kong government has no plans to change the current practice,"" Ip said.
While the status of Hong Kong people travelling to the United States after July 1 has become clearer, questions still hang over locals with U.S. passports but who want to hold on to their Hong Kong permanent residency.
China, which does not recognise dual nationality, has said ethnic Chinese Hong Kong residents will be regarded as Chinese nationals with no right to foreign consular protection unless they declare their foreign citizenship.
Boucher indicated that Hong Kong residents with U.S. passports should make use of them when crossing borders to make clear their citizenship.
""An American citizen is an American citizen and we will endeavour to assist (them) whenever they need assistance.
""By taking advantage of their passports, it's easier for both sides to understand who is regarded an American and how we can protect them,"" Boucher said.
Separately, U.S. Ambassader to Beijing James Sasser told a business lunch in Hong Kong that Washington would keep a keen eye on the territory after the handover.
""Americans have invested $15 billion here. To sustain this U.S. presence requires a society governed by the rule of law and protection of basic freedom,"" he said.

2607,"Hong Kong's colonial government cautioned Beijing on Monday not to cause constitutional problems by enacting laws for the territory before Britain hands it back to China at midnight on June 30.
Security Secretary Peter Lai said Beijing might spark a flurry of lawsuits that would work against its declared aim of a smooth transition for Hong Kong.
Lai's warning came after Hong Kong's future lawmakers from a China-appointed provisional legislature said they would develop laws for the territory before July 1, which marks the end of more than 150 years of British colonial rule.
Residency rights, or the so-called ""right of abode"", in Hong Kong after the handover are among the issues China wants the body to decide before the handover, but the Hong Kong government is opposed, Lai said.
""We clearly cannot accept this because there can only be one legislature for Hong Kong before July 1, and that is the legally constituted Legislative Council of Hong Kong which exists today,"" Lai told reporters.
But the Hong Kong government warning appeared unlikely to worry China. Lu Ping, Beijing's top official on Hong Kong matters, said the right of abode issue was an internal affair because it concerned China's nationality laws.
""The provisional legislature does not need the approval of the British government,"" Lu told reporters.
The 60-member provisional legislature that Beijing intends to install in place of the elected council faces fierce opposition from the pro-democracy camp. Democrats have vowed to sue the body if it tries to make laws before July 1.
While Britain and China have agreed on major provisions on the right of abode, they are deadlocked on actual legislation.
""Immigration/nationality matters are a notoriously litigious area...if decisions have to be taken on the basis of legislation processed by the provisional legislature before July 1, they would attract a huge amount of litigation which could paralyse the immigration system in Hong Kong after June 30,"" Lai said.
""That would be highly unconducive to a smooth transition.""
The issue on right of abode in Hong Kong after July 1 is close to the hearts of 750,000 Hong Kong people who have obtained foreign citizenship in recent years but who also value their permanent residency rights in Hong Kong.
Uncertainty has prompted a scramble for air tickets among migrants anxious to land in Hong Kong before midnight June 30.
Emigrants can establish permanent right of abode in Hong Kong if they return within 18 months of the handover, the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office in Beijing said.
Hong Kong Chinese will retain Hong Kong permanent residency status unless they stay away for more than 36 months before resettling in the territory, a spokesman for the office said.
Rita Fan, president of the interim legislature, vowed to press on and make the draft right of abode bill into law.

2610,"In a move certain to anger Beijing, publisher Penguin group and Chinese activists on Friday launched a compilation of letters and essays written in prison by prominent Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng.
China's Foreign Ministry has already denounced publication of the book ""The Courage To Stand Alone"", which contains excerpts of hundreds of letters Wei wrote to his siblings, prison authorities and top members of China's Communist Party.
The eloquent and fearless letters were written during his 14-year (1979 to 1993) imprisonment, most of the time while in solitary confinement in a tiny cell.
Wei, 47, is China's best known dissident and regarded as the father of China's democracy movement.
He was jailed in 1979 for counter-revolutionary incitement after advocating democratic change when he referred to democracy as China's much needed ""fifth modernisation"".
Wei managed to obtain his letters, many of which were never mailed but kept in his prison dossier, just before he was released from jail in September 1993.
After six months of freedom, Wei was detained again in 1994 and later sentenced to a further 14 years for treason.
At a news conference on Friday, Chinese pro-democracy activists called for the immediate release of Wei, who has been denied medical attention for his deteriorating health.
""I am asking all of you, the people of Hong Kong and all freedom loving people of the world, to join me in demanding Wei Jingsheng's immediate and unconditional release,"" said Xiao Qiang, executive director of lobby group Human Rights in China.
""Democracy and human rights are not luxuries for Chinese people, they are necessities,"" Xiao said.
Wei, now in a jail in Hebei province, has arthritis, high blood pressure and stomach problems, and his spirit is now flagging, according to members of his family who are allowed to visit him once a month, said Robin Munro of Human Rights Watch/Asia.
""From accounts of his family, he has become very despondent. We have to be worried about his survival this time,"" said Munro.
Also present at the news conference was dissident Liu Qing, and close friend of Wei, who was jailed for 10 years for publishing the transcript of Wei's 1979 trial.
Liu told reporters he was worried about the future of political and human rights in Hong Kong after midnight June 30, when the territory of 6.4 million people reverts to Chinese rule after 156 years as a British colony.
Under Sino-British treaties on Hong Kong's handover, the territory is promised a high degree of self rule under a ""one country, two systems"" formula that was espoused by the late Deng.
""For the long term, I cannot believe in China's dictatorship. In the last few decades, this government has never kept to its words. It has always gone back on its words, its policy on Tibet and many other policies,"" Liu said.
""I cannot say that Hong Kong will be an exception to this record,"" said Liu, the chairman of Human Rights in China.

2611,"Hong Kong's colonial government cautioned Beijing on Monday not to cause constitutional problems by enacting laws for the territory before Britain hands it back to China at midnight on June 30.
Security Secretary Peter Lai said Beijing might spark a flurry of lawsuits that would work against its declared aim of a smooth transition for the territory.
Lai's warning came after Hong Kong's future lawmakers in a China-appointed provisional legislature said they would develop laws for the territory before July 1, when more than 150 years of British colonial rule officially will end.
Residency rights, or so-called ""right of abode"", in Hong Kong after the handover are among the issues that China wants the body to decide before the handover, but the Hong Kong government is opposed, Lai said.
""We clearly cannot accept this because there can only be one legislature for Hong Kong before July 1, and that is the legally constituted Legislative Council of Hong Kong which exists today,"" Lai told reporters.
The 60-member provisional legislature that Beijing intends to put in place of the elected legislature faces fierce opposition from the vocal pro-democracy camp.
Democrats have vowed to sue the body if it tries to make laws before July 1.
While Britain and China have agreed on major provisions on right of abode, they are deadlocked on actual legislation. Any attempt by the interim legislature to enact it into law before the handover would spell trouble, Lai said.
""Immigration/nationality matters are a notoriously litigious area...if decisions have to be taken on the basis of legislation processed by the provisional legislature before July 1, they would attract a huge amount of litigation which could paralyse the immigration system in Hong Kong after June 30,"" he said.
""That would be highly unconducive to a smooth transition.""
Hugh Davies, Britain's envoy to joint Sino-British talks on the handover, blamed Beijing for failing to reach agreements.
""We have been unable to do so (reach agreements)...because (China) is insisting this is a matter in legislative terms for the provisional legislature, which is a most undesirable outcome.""
The issue on right of abode in Hong Kong after July 1 is very close to the hearts of 750,000 Hong Kong people who have obtained foreign citizenship in recent years but who also value their permanent residency rights in Hong Kong.
Uncertainty has prompted a scramble for air tickets among migrants anxious to land in Hong Kong before midnight June 30.
Emigrants can establish permanent right of abode in Hong Kong if they return within 18 months of the handover, the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office in Beijing said.
Hong Kong Chinese will retain Hong Kong permanent residency status unless they stay away for more than 36 months before resettling in the territory, a spokesman for the office said.
The Hong Kong government warning appeared unlikely to stop China's plan. Rita Fan, president of the interim legislature, vowed to press on and make the draft right of abode bill into law the moment it is submitted to the provisional legislature.
""The council would commence to scrutinise the bill and ensure the procedure of three readings of the bill be completed before June 30...the legislation would then be confirmed on July 1,"" Fan said in a statement.

2614,"A second wave of Chinese soldiers arrived in Hong Kong on Monday to prepare garrison facilities before Beijing takes back the territory from Britain on July 1.
Sixty-six uniformed but unarmed soldiers of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) drove into Hong Kong in a fleet of 14 staff vehicles from the Chinese border city of Shenzhen.
Monday's group was the second PLA contingent in as many months to arrive in the territory under arrangements worked out by the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group overseeing details of Hong Kong's sovereignty change.
Forty soldiers entered on April 21 to prepare logistics and facilities before the eventual arrival on July 1 of the rest of the Chinese troops to be stationed in the territory.
Major-General Liu Zhenwu, commander of the future garrison in Hong Kong, officiated a solemn send-off ceremony on the Chinese side of the border, according to the official Chinese Xinhua news agency.
Liu urged the advance party ""to carry on the fine traditions of the PLA, and to perform the sacred duties entrusted to them by the country and people"".
A handful of British soldiers and Chinese officers from the first advance group greeted the latest contingent on the Hong Kong side in a brief and low-key ceremony.
Sporting dark blue berets and crisply-starched uniforms, the 66 PLA troops crossed over at 1.00 p.m. (0500 GMT) in a convoy comprising a large air-conditioned bus, green army trucks, jeeps and black Audi cars.
Hong Kong, a British colony for more than 150 years, reverts to China on July 1 and the British garrison is already packing up ahead of its departure at midnight June 30.
From July 1, the bustling capitalist city of 6.4 million will be guarded by the PLA.
After the brief greetings, the British soldiers then climbed aboard the Chinese vehicles to help give directions to the Sek Kong military camp in the New Territories.
Besides Sek Kong, the latest group will be stationed in the Prince of Wales Barracks, Stonecutters Island and Gun Club Hill Barracks, a Hong Kong government spokesman said.
A third and final advance guard of 90 soliders is scheduled to arrive on May 30, bringing the total preparatory force of Chinese troops in Hong Kong to 196 before the handover.
Many Hong Kong people are concerned about the presence of PLA troops in the territory because of the bloody military crackdown on activists in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989.
China plans to station some 10,000 troops in the territory after the handover, about the same number as the British garrison at its peak.
But the Chinese officers have been careful to make sure that the troops who have already arrived are keeping a low profile.

2620,"Its wheels whirring non-stop, Hong Kong is moving into top gear to prepare for one of the high points in its history -- its return to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30 after a century and a half as a British colony.
In a land where people are often too busy rushing about their own business and civil servants too occupied to pay heed to the walk-in visitor, the historic changeover is giving the city a sparkling facelift.
Roads and tiny lanes leading to the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, where the midnight handover ceremony will take place, have been cleared of street-sleepers. In theiur place are pretty potted plants and ornamental iron fences.
Elaborate ""1997 handover"" lighting displays depicting dragons, dolphins and orchids illuminate glassy tower blocks.
In just 12 days, Britain will hand Hong Kong back to China.
As the big night nears, over 4,000 VIPs including heads of state, ministers and officials from all over the world will descend upon the territory to witness the historic flag change.
Thanks to almost 8,000 foreign reporters, specially flown in for the occasion, the event will be beamed to every television set and chronicled in every newspaper on the planet.
Tiny, famously industrious, Hong Kong is leaving nothing to chance.
Hotels have given intensive training to bellboys and chambermaids so they can field, as well as any schoolmaster, tough questions from puzzled VIPs or hustling reporters on Hong Kong history, geography, nightlife and typhoon threats.
At front-line government offices, civil servants seconded to the huge celebration machinery beam from ear to ear as they try to cater to the whims of visiting and local newsmen.
""I'm really impressed,"" a local reporter said as she walked into a press liaison office to get her identification dog tag.
On hand were a dozen staff and she was on his way in under 10 minutes with a stylish sling-bag full of giveaways -- courtesy of blue-chip sponsors only too happy to play a part.
At Hong Kong's top-notch hotels, employees have been given security clearance by police and their best suites, reserved for the VIPs, will be swept clean with bomb detectors.
Anyone up to mischief or with no business at the hotel stands little chance of getting his toe over the lintel, said a public relations manager at the five-star hotel JW Marriot.
""The Hong Kong police is very much involved. From the 28th, guests coming in and out must go through metal detectors, just like in airports,"" manager Peachie Dieken said.
JW Marriot will be playing host to 11 heads of state, and some rooms have even been reserved for police officers during the handover, in case they are needed for any emergency.

2621,"As speculation mounted in Hong Kong about a possible link between Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd and a Chinese partner, the Hong Kong utility chose to keep mum on Thursday about its future shareholding structure.
""Today is not the time, the place to say specifically what will be done,"" deputy chairman Richard Brown told a news conference. ""There are rumours covered in the press and we don't comment on them"".
In the run-up to July 1, when the British colony of Hong Kong will revert to Chinese rule, markets have been awash with rumours of state Chinese enterprises preparing to buy their way into the Hong Kong telecommunications giant.
Hongkong Telecom is 58.5 percent-owned by Cable &amp; Wireless Plc but analysts said both companies may see the wisdom in taking on a mainland partner because of the handover.
However top officials at the Hongkong Telecom news conference, where the company reported a 12.5 percent rise in net profit for the year to March 31 to HK$11.18 ($1.44) billion, declined to answer reporters' questions on the issue.
China's Ministry of Post and Telecommunications (MPT) and China United Telecommunications Corp (China Unicom) have been consistently pinpointed by the local press as likely partners.
A China Unicom official told reporters on Wednesday the company was interested in buying a stake in Hongkong Telecom.
China Unicom is a joint venture of 16 major Chinese organisations, led by the ministries of power, railways and electronics industry.
Brown told reporters there were scores of companies which were interested in partnering Hongkong Telecom, but the company would only reveal details when something was firm.
A seasoned China observer said it was a foregone conclusion that Hongkong Telecom, like all other crucial infrastructure giants in the territory, will see an injection of Chinese interest, whichever state enterprise that came from.
""It's a positive and logical step. It opens scope for more cooperation with the mainland. Big state enterprises will want some kind of say in Hong Kong, after all these years,"" the observer said.
Powerful Chinese enterprises like CITIC Pacific have claimed large chunks of the territory's air carrier Cathay Pacific Ltd and utility China Light and Power, while China National Aviation Corp bought nearly 36 percent of Hong Kong Dragon Airlines Ltd last year.
An analyst with a foreign research firm, who declined to be named, said some investors viewed positively talk of a Unicom stake in Hong Kong Telecom. But he noted that Unicom had problems of its own.
""It is struggling with MPT and has so far nothing much apart from a mobile business in China,"" he said.
""Unicom has a host of shareholders from many different ministries and this could be a negative thing because all of them have different, conflicting views.""
Shares in Hong Kong Telecom rose to their highest level in almost a year on Thursday, gaining HK$0.80 to close at HK$15.00.

2623,"China-controlled China Everbright Holdings Co Ltd emerged from out of the blue on Friday as the new China link for HongKong Telecommunications Ltd, analysts said.
Months of suspense were ended earlier when Hong Kong-based conglomerate CITIC Pacific Ltd said it would sell its 7.74 percent stake in Hongkong Telecom to China Everbright, a holding company controlled by China's State Council.
""It's not surprising that they will want a minority stake in a large strategic asset like Hongkong Telecom,"" said Andrew Fernow, director of research at Vickers Ballas.
But analysts were at a loss to say what China Everbright could bring to Hongkong Telecom.
""The biggest question is what edge could China Everbright possibly offer to Hongkong Telecom?"" a China analyst at a European firm said. ""It's like a snake swallowing an elephant.""
China Everbright Holdings has three listed subsidiaries in Hong Kong -- China Everbright International Ltd, China Everbright Technology Ltd and China Everbright-IHD Pacific Ltd.
It is one of 16 equal shareholders in China United Telecommunications Corp (China Unicom), China's second largest telecommunications provider after the powerful Ministry of Post and Telecommunications (MPT).
Unicom, set up in July 1994 at a total cost of 1.28 billion yuan (or 80 million yuan from each of its 16 partners), provides basic and long-distance telecommunications services, as well as mobile and paging facilities in China.
In recent weeks, both Unicom and MPT have been widely tipped as possible China partners of Hongkong Telecom, which as a foreign company is prevented from direct participating in China's telecom market.
But Unicom is known to be troubled by a host of problems, ranging from a lack of cash to its well-known friction with MPT. ""Unicom has no money to buy into Hongkong Telecom now,"" an analyst with another European firm said. ""As China Everbright is one of the shareholders in Unicom, it could be buying it first, and Unicom could come into the picture later.""
But while China Everbright had little in terms of assets to bring, it did have the connections in China, one analyst noted.
Zhu Xiaohua, known to be a close associate of China's economic tsar Zhu Rongji, is the chairman of China Everbright.
He had been deputy governor of the People's Bank of China and the deputy director of the economics department at the Hong Kong branch of Xinhua news agency prior to joining the China Everbright group in July 1996.
In China, however, there was at least one party keenly watching the developments that snowballed in Hong Kong.
A Unicom source said the company was watching developments but refused to disclose further details.
""Ask Everbright, or CITIC,"" the Unicom source said.

2625,"For many in China, a fabled El Dorado lies at the southern tip of their vast country -- Hong Kong, rich and elusive.
The dream is likely to stay that way after the British-ruled territory reverts to Chinese rule on June 30.
Yang He, a Hong Kong resident for the past 40 years, has waited more than 11 years for his son to get a permit to come from China to join him, his wife and two daughters.
""We applied in 1986 for my son to come to Hong Kong. He has been cared for by his grandparents since he was a baby.
""We had to leave him when he was only 25 days old because he had no permit,"" Yang, 56, told Reuters in a recent interview.
""Most nights I cannot sleep for just thinking of him.""
Yang is not alone in his suffering.
Hong Kong authorities say there are 34,000 children in China waiting to join either one or both parents in Hong Kong, but Chinese authorities say the figure could be higher than 100,000.
CHINESE HEAR OF CITY STREETS PAVED WITH GOLD
In China, rock stars sing patriotic songs welcoming the return of Hong Kong, and television stations beam into Chinese homes documentaries describing the wealthy metropolis, giving an impression of streets lined with opportunities -- and gold.
But most of China's 1.2 billion people will probably never set foot on Hong Kong soil.
Although the British will leave and the Chinese red flag will flutter over the territory, Hong Kong will be separately run under a ""one country, two systems"" formula espoused by China's late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.
To stop a flood of mainlanders into the tiny but crowded territory of 6.4 million people, border security is tight -- on both sides of the line.
Hong Kong operates a quota system permitting 150 mainlanders to migrate to Hong Kong each day, 66 of them children.
But it can take years to obtain the precious ""one-way permit"" -- and many resort to backdoor methods in dispair.
QUOTAS OPEN TO CORRUPTION
China-born Yang said he has totally lost faith in China's bureaucracy and communist system, which he said was so riddled with corruption that only the rich can buy their way out.
""In 1995, when I asked again about the status of my son's application, they (government officials) asked for money. They said they wanted at least HK$130,000 (US$16,800),"" Yang said.
""They told me it wasn't them who would take all the money, they have to ask favours from other people, buy cigarettes, drinks, fruit, and there wasn't such a thing as digging from their own pockets to pay my son's passage to Hong Kong.""
Yang paid HK$40,000 (US$5,175) and a few gold rings when he applied in 1985 to get his wife and eldest daughter to join him.
They arrived in 1986. But there was no permit for his baby.
""If you have money, you can come, proudly by train, if not, you can't come. If you haven't enough, you come illegally, dangerously by speedboat in the night,"" he said.
""You don't know the Chinese system, it is so corrupt, it would be best if after the handover, the Hong Kong government takes over the responsibility of approving the applications,"" said So Ying, a mother who has waited five years for her son and daughter to join her and her husband in Hong Kong.
Some get so frustrated by the wait that they have taken the matter into their own hands, paying between HK$2,000 to HK$4,000 to smugglers -- or ""snakeheads"" as they are known locally -- to spirit their spouses and children into Hong Kong.
Between January and April 1997, 1,449 young illegal migrants surrendered to authorities against 540 for the whole of 1996.
In the first four months of 1997, 7,406 illegal migrants, including adults, were arrested around border areas, against 23,180 for the whole of 1996.
HONG KONG AUTHORITIES GET TOUGH
In an unusual show of force, Hong Kong immigration officials last month seized eight-year-old Chung Yeuk-lam and her mother from their flat and sent them back to China.
The girl had been carried illegally into Hong Kong by her mother when she was just three months old.
Colonial Governor Chris Patten said it was important not to make exceptions in order to quash rumours spread by snakeheads that there will be an amnesty for illegals after the handover, which the Hong Kong government has repeatedly denied.
Hong Kong and Chinese authorities have joined forces to block the tide of mainland Chinese illegal immigrants.
The South China Morning Post has said one way to help solve the problem would be to quash the El Dorado myth in China.
""The simplest way to shrink their numbers would be if China dispelled the idea that Hong Kong's streets are paved with gold,"" the newspaper said.

2627,"Crucial talks between Hong Kong and Taiwan on how to continue direct shipping links after the British-ruled territory reverts to China foundered on Friday when the two sides hit an impasse over which flags to fly.
The one-day talks, aimed at resolving sensitive details of shipping protocol, hit a major snag when the two sides failed to agree on which flags ships should fly when plying routes between Hong Kong and Taiwan, the Taiwanese representative said.
""The obstacle is the flag. This is a contentious issue,"" deputy secretary-general Chang Liang-jen of the semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation said at a news conference.
""It's a very complicated matter and a difficult one to settle just in one meeting,"" Chang said at the end of the talks.
Ships registered in Hong Kong and Taiwan currently follow the international practice of flying each other's flag when entering the other's territorial waters.
But this practice must be abandoned after Britain hands back Hong Kong to China on July 1, as the territory's post-handover constitution has a clause saying it must observe the ""one-China"" principle.
Communist-ruled China has viewed Taiwan as a rebel province since the Nationalist government fled to the island after losing a Chinese civil war in 1949. Beijing fiercely opposes any symbol or gesture of Taiwan independence.
As a result, Hong Kong ships will not be allowed to fly the Taiwan flag.
Taipei wants Taiwan and Hong Kong ships to lower all flags and identify themselves by telex before entering each other's waters, but Hong Kong is against the idea.
""Every ship in the world has to fly a flag according to international maritime laws. Only a pirate's ship is without a flag,"" said George Chao, head of the Hong Kong Shipowners' Association.
Chao, who held a separate news conference after Chang left, admitted he was constrained by guidelines given by China.
""Beijing has given me the 'one-China' principle within which to operate,"" he said, adding that although the meeting had not nailed down an agreement, it had ruled out some options.
""Both sides have agreed the Chinese flag and the Taiwanese flag will not be flown,"" he said.
But he refused to say whether Hong Kong's future flag, depicting the tropical bauhinia flower, or Taiwan's unofficial plum blossom flag used in international sport gatherings and other events were options under consideration.
""Until we agree, I will not disclose our plan,"" he said.
China, which has kept conspicuously silent on the issue, is keenly interested and monitoring it closely.
A China-backed Hong Kong newspaper said on Friday that the continuation of shipping links between Hong Kong and Taiwan after July 1 must abide by the ""one-China"" principle.
""Carrying the Taiwan national flag is in conflict with the one-China policy,"" Wen Wei Pao said.
But the newspaper offered a solution.
""The problem was solved for air traffic when China Airlines replaced the Taiwan flag on its logo with the plum blossom. It should not be too hard for sea traffic to do something similar,"" it said.
Chao said he was confident a decision would be reached before July 1. The two sides will hold their second meeting in Taipei, probably in two weeks' time, he added.

2635,"The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) signed an agreement on Thursday to hook up the Hong Kong Futures Exchange (HKFE) to its NYMEX ACCESS trading system, a move that may challenge Singapore's trading headstart.
Officials from both exchanges said Hong Kong's cash trading base and trading expertise could not compare with Singapore's, especially in the energy field, but rising oil and metals use in Asia, particularly China, would see a growing demand for risk management and hedging opportunities.
""I see great potential in China, refineries in South Korea and the rest of Asia, potential that provides the key to this (linkage),"" NYMEX president Patrick Thompson said at a news conference after the agreement was signed in Hong Kong.
The link with Hong Kong, expected to go into operation around the end of March 1997, would allow HKFE members to trade existing NYMEX futures and options contracts on the ACCESS system during local Hong Kong trading hours under a mutual-offset system.
The agreement with the HKFE seemed to throw into doubt NYMEX's intention expressed in 1994 to cooperate with the Singapore International Monetary Exchange (SIMEX), where two energy contracts already trade, albeit sluggishly.
While officials of the exchanges denied that rivalry with Singapore had catapulted Hong Kong into Thursday's deal, Thompson suggested the linkup with Hong Kong -- and with Sydney in 1995 -- would render a linkup with SIMEX more unlikely.
""Talks are progressing very, very slowly and Singapore is certainly not as much of a priority with us now as previously,"" Thompson said, adding the deal with the HKFE would introduce constraints that would affect any future deal with SIMEX.
SIMEX would also be cut out of any new futures and options contracts that NYMEX was working to introduce in Asia with the help of a newly formed Oil Advisory Committee.
The committee, made up of 30 members from Asia's oil community, would work out new contracts tailored to physical products traded in the region in terms of pricing and quality.
The first meeting, held last week in Singapore, brought together representatives from state oil companies, major oil players, Wall Street traders and top brokers, all of whom were eager to see the introduction of new oil futures contracts.
""We were gratified by the interest shown...and the unanimous crying need for new products,"" Thompson said, adding new contracts would be launched not with SIMEX but with the HKSE.
New crude and gas oil (diesel) futures contracts received overwhelming votes from the committee, but more meetings would be held to determine the type and specifications of the new product as well as its pricing formula, Thompson said.
NYMEX, the world's largest physical commodity exchange, offers contracts on the benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude, heating oil, natural gas and unleaded gasoline on its energy complex and gold, silver and copper on the metals complex.
NYMEX, together with its COMEX division, trades a daily volume of 310,000 contracts each day during day trading hours.
Its overnight ACCESS system rakes in around 5,000 contracts each night, and the volume has risen between 25 to 30 percent each year since it was launched in 1993.
Hong Kong would be the fifth location where ACCESS trades can be executed, after New York, Sydney, Chicago and London.
NYMEX officials will visit Hong Kong in coming months to train exchange members in energy and metals futures trading, said Ivers Riley, chief of the HKFE.

2636,"Democracy leader Martin Lee returned on Monday from a foreign tour highlighted by talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton and convinced Hong Kong has friends anxious to preserve its freedoms after China takes over.
The head of the Hong Kong Democratic Party met Clinton at the White House and won a promise of U.S. support after the British colony is handed back to China on July 1.
Analysts contrasted Lee's tour of the United States, Canada and Switzerland with the recent falling popularity poll ratings suffered by the territory's future leader, Tung Chee-hwa, who last week called off his own U.S. tour amid a wave of criticism of proposed plans to curb civil liberties after the handover.
Tung, who will govern from July 1, was criticised by the United States, Britain and Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp for plans to ban foreign funding and curb protests.
He caused another stir when he admitted donating 50,000 sterling (US$81,500) to Britain's Conservative Party in 1992.
""Lee has made quite a victory. Quite apart from what he achieved from his tour, he subjected himself to scrutiny by groups of people,"" said law professor and political analyst Nihal Jayawickrama of the University of Hong Kong.
""While that was happening, we had Mr Tung saying he was disappointed with Lee and the exposure for his own activities which has affected his credibility quite considerably.""
Jubilant after his hectic month-long 12-city lobbying tour, Lee said he was convinced Hong Kong had friends worldwide who wanted to preserve its freedoms after China takes over.
Lee said governments in the West had a moral responsibility to see that China abides by its treaty pledge of allowing Hong Kong's freewheeling lifestyle to endure for another 50 years.
""We're not fighting alone for human rights and democracy in Hong Kong. We have many friends in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States and Europe,"" he said.
Hong Kong, a British colony for more than 150 years, reverts to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30 under a 1984 treaty.
Many in the bustling territory of 6.4 million fear a loss of fundamental freedoms after the handover, now just 71 days away.
Apart from the latest threat of curbs on freedom, China plans to replace Hong Kong's elected legislature with one carefully crafted by Beijing.
""We reminded the U.S. government and all other governments that supported the Joint Declaration they owe Hong Kong a moral responsibility to make sure the rule of law, civil liberties are preserved after the sovereignty changeover,"" Lee said.
Lee, whose return coincided with the arrival of a small advance party of Chinese soldiers to prepare for the rest of the garrison on July 1, said he did not think it was necessary to have Chinese troops in Hong Kong.
""The stationing of troops in Shenzhen would have been sufficient to protect Hong Kong if necessary,"" he said.
""The British garrison was stationed here for an obvious reason, that is in case there was an invasion from a certain direction. But when Hong Kong is part of China there is no question of Hong Kong facing such a threat,"" he said.
Lee said he was deeply worried about the impact of Tung's planned curbs on protests and the ban on overseas fund-raising.
""If Mr Tung stops us, and it becomes law, we will have to decide what to do,"" he said. His party raised HK$2.5 million (US$323,000) from Chinese communities in its month-long tour.

2647,"Hong Kong activists on Tuesday denounced Japanese nationalists who staged a landing on Japanese administered islands that are also claimed by China and Taiwan.
More than a dozen activists staged a noisy protest outside Japan's consulate in Hong Kong's stockbroker district to condemn the landing on the islands as a revival of Japanese militarism.
They also demanded that Tokyo apologise for its war crimes in World War Two, when Japan occupied large parts of China as well as Hong Kong.
The latest flare-up over the disputed isles, called the Senkakus in Japan and Diaoyus in China, was triggered by a Japanese nationalist legislator.
Shingo Nishimura, a member of Japan's main opposition New Frontier Party, together with Okinawa politician Hitoshi Nakama and two other people held a brief ceremony on one of the islands on Tuesday.
Cheung Man-kwong, a member of the Action Committee for Protection of the Diaoyu Islands in Hong Kong, said he was incensed by the landing and threatened to take further action.
""Of course we are very angry. Very clearly, they are trying to invade the Diaoyus which belong to China,"" Cheung said.
""I will discuss with my group and we will take some action,"" Cheung, an elected pro-democracy legislator, told Reuters.
Albert Ho, chairman of the Action Committee, described the landing attempt as an act of aggression and provocation against China. He said it made the group more determined to carry out plans to sail to the isles from Taiwan on May 18.
Hong Kong activists said last week they would launch the landing attempt with Taiwanese activists, but the Japanese Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday the government would repel any future attempts to land on the islands.
The decades-old dispute exploded into fiery anti-Japanese protests in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Chinese communities elsewhere last year after ultra-rightists in Japan built a makeshift lighthouse on one of the islands in July.
Tuesday's incident threatens to rekindle the Diaoyu protest movement, less than two months before the British colony of Hong Kong is returned to China, at midnight on June 30.
Last September tens of thousands of people turned out to mourn a Hong Kong activist who drowned after jumping into stormy waters near the islands to press China's claim.

2651,"As megadealer H. Wayne Huizenga continued to gobble up more new car franchises Monday, the National Automobile Dealers Association's top economist said traditional dealers are poised to grab more of the used vehicle market and exploit their superior parts service.
""All in all, we have a pretty favourable outlook in terms of our industry,"" Tom Webb, chief economist of NADA, told a news conference at the group's annual convention.
Webb's comments came hours after Huizenga's Republic Industries Inc. announced the purchase of Wallace Automotive Group, a six-dealer group that operates Ford, Nissan, Dodge, Mitsubishi and two Lincoln-Mercury dealerships in southeast Florida.
The deal, valued at $55 million, pushes Republic's total 1997 new dealer revenue estimates for 1997 to about $2.8 billion, a Republic spokesman said, erasing any doubt that Republic is now the largest new vehicle dealer group in the country in terms of revenues.
In a swipe at the superstore trend, Webb disputed the idea that selling large volumes of new or used vehicles will cut more costs or generate higher profits. One analysis conducted by NADA showed economies of scale benefits stop after 100 vehicles a month.
""People who think that just increasing volume is the answer are totally wrong,"" he said.
The new car market remains a mature one, Webb said, with average 1996 dealer profits per vehicle at about $40. The used vehicle segment is growing twice as quickly, he said, because franchisers are picking up more business from small, less-sophisticated used car operators, as well as people who no longer prefer trying to sell a car or truck themselves.
Traditional dealers now control about 31 percent of used retail unit sales and have a 50 percent share of the market in terms of revenue dollars, said Webb. Retail sales of used vehicles number between 40 million and 45 million a year, he said.
""I think the franchised dealer share will grow,"" he said.
Webb also believes franchised dealers can make gains with their parts and service operations, which he said consistently receive high quality rankings.
Webb said traditional dealers have an inherent advantage over superstores structured like CarMax, a unit of Circuit Cities Stores Inc. , because they have more than one profit centre. The CarMax chain now only makes money from one area -- used cars, according to Webb. But franchised dealers make money off used cars, parts and financing.
Franchised dealers have also benefited from growth in lending to higher-risk buyers. Even if those loans later become delinquent, it is not the dealer's problem, as he or she has already made money from the sale, Webb said.
He said he is not concerned about consumer debt levels hurting vehicle sales. Although some industry experts believe the overall selling cycle is becoming more stable, he said the industry still remains vulnerable to a downturn in the economy.
""A new vehicle is a very postponeable purchase,"" said Webb. ""So if the economy weakens, yes, we will suffer.""
For 1997, NADA predicts there will be a net loss of 100 to 150 dealerships, continuing a gradual consolidation that has been under way since the 1940s. According to NADA, there were 22,000 new vehicle dealers in 1996, more than 50,000 franchises and about 15,000 dealer principals.

2653,"If Miss Manners, the nation's arbiter of proper taste and decorum, can find good things to say about car dealers, then the industry must be doing something right.
That was the message John Peterson, outgoing president of the National Automobile Dealers Association, delivered on Saturday in a speech that railed against the media and others who say traditional car dealerships are on the way out.
""It's time we stood up for what our industry is doing right out there,"" said Peterson. ""So, to our friends in the media, I say take a tip from one of your own, Miss Manners, and park that old stereotype of fast-talking salesmen in plaid coats and white bucks.""
According to Peterson, Miss Manners, whose real name is Judith Martin, wrote a column in 1996 after she shopped for a new car in which she said she was ""astonished"" at the ""dignified courtesy"" she found at a dozen dealerships she visted.
Peterson spoke at the opening day of the NADA's 80th annual convention and equipment exposition.
In his remarks, Peterson acknowledged the traditional dealer franchise system is facing numerous challenges from the explosive growth of used car superstores such as CarMax and AutoNation USA.
But he said traditional franchised dealers will remain the dominant system for selling new cars and trucks. In a year when the superstores grew rapidly, Peterson said franchised dealers boosted sales by three percent, increased profits by 25 percent, and finished the year with 23,000 dealerships in operation.
Of the approximately 15 million new light vehicles expected to be sold in 1997, 14.5 million will be sold by the current franchise system.
Peterson also took issue with critics who say car dealers do not respond to customers, saying a recent survey by the Newspaper Association of America indicated that more than 90 percent of new-vehicle buyers are satisified or very satisfied.
""No business is more poked at, picked at, anaylzed, written about and castigated for failing to live up to performance standards that no other business in the country is expected to meet,"" said Peterson.
In the NADA's keynote speech, Toyota Motor Corp's top executive in the U.S. told the audience that franchised new-car dealers will continue to be the cornerstone of the U.S. automotive retailing industry.
Yale Gieszel, executive vice president of Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc, said consumers -- and not auto superstores -- are driving the changes rocking the business.
""Large retail chains or automobile department stores are not the answer to the challenges we face. The current franchise system will not only survive, it will flourish,"" he said.
At a news conference afterward, Gieszel said he does not believe the large superstore chains can reap enough economies of scale that they can outperform local franchises. Gieszel also said Toyota is not convinced the large superstores can offer the close customer attention that individual dealers can.

2660,"Fearsome of injuries caused by deploying airbags, consumers polled by a market research firm gave safety a lower ranking when choosing a new vehicle for the first time in four years, according to a study released on Sunday.
The biggest drop came with regard to airbags, which have been linked to the deaths of dozens of children and small adults by federal safety regulators.
The number of people who gave driver and passenger side air bags a very important or important rating fell to 57 percent from 82 percent the previous year, according to the report conducted by the Dohring Co. Inc., a Glendale, Calif.-based market research firm.
Respondents who said those air bags are ""not at all important"" in their purchase decision jumped to 24 percent from 6 percent.
""No doubt the safety reports of physical injury have contributed to this,"" Rik Kinney, senior vice president of Dohring Co. ""This is the first time since we started doing this study in 1993 that the importance of all safety-related equipment declined.""
Kinney said 96 percent of those surveyed had seen or heard media reports of potential injuries from airbags. Harm to children ranked as the single biggest fear, with 45 percent of those listing that as a concern.
The study was conducted in January 1997 from a random sample of 1,253 consumers in all 50 states. The poll's margin of error is 2.8 percent.
In other findings, the Dohring study found the number of people who have purchased or will shop at a new car dealership have access to on-line information serivces was up 10 percent to 38 percent.
But the study found that 81 percent of those talked to would still want to test drive a vehicle, even if they researched it over a computer on-line service. Only 4 percent plan to use an on-line service to buy their vehicle.
The study also found that 28 percent of the respondents would rather buy their next used car from a new car dealership that has a manufacturer's certified program, vs. 15 percent who said they would go to a used car superstore.
Kinney said the study was paid for by Dohring. But he acknowledged the company receives 99 percent of its revenues from by selling research to automakers, dealer advertising associations and individual auto dealerships.

2684,"General Motors Corp. said Tuesday its fourth quarter earnings fell by more than half as labour strife in the second half of the year cost it $700 million in profits.
The world's largest automaker earned $786 million, or 92 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, down from $1.59 billion, or $1.95 a share, in the 1995 fourth quarter. All figures exclude results from Electronic Data Systems Corp., which was spun off last June.
Revenues fell to $40.95 billion from $41.35 billion.
For all of 1996, GM earned $4.95 billion, or $6.06 a share, down from $6.03 billion, or $7.14 a share. Revenues for the year rose to $164.1 billion from $160.3 billion.
Workers from the United Auto Workers union and Canadian Auto Workers union struck GM last fall after talks broke down on a new three-year contract. In March 1996, a UAW strike at two Dayton, Ohio, brake plants crippled GM's North American production for more than two weeks.
All told, GM said work stoppages in the United States and Canada reduced its full-year earnings by $1.2 billion on an after-tax basis.
""Clearly our 1996 fourth-quarter and calendar-year results were impacted by the strike-related production losses in the United States and Canada and are not indicative of GM's potential for continued profit improvement,"" GM Chairman John Smith said.
The strikes also took a bite out of the 1996 profit sharing checks for GM's union workers. GM said 282,000 represented workers in the United States will receive about $300 each -- less than half of the $800 each received last year.
GM said 76,000 eligible salaried workers will receive 1996 incentive payments, with payments rising with the level of pay and responsibility. By comparison, Chrysler Corp. announced last week its U.S. workers will each receive an average of $7,900 in profit sharing.
GM's 1996 fourth quarter results included several one-time accounting items, including a $157 million loss on the sale of four Delphi parts plants to Peregrine Inc. and a $167 million charge for lump sum payments to UAW members as part of its new labour contract.
Including the strike-related effects, the one-time items brought down GM's fourth quarter earnings by $762 million, or 99 cents a share. However, the fourth quarter also included a separate, favourable tax gain of $262 million.
GM's North American operations, its core automotive group in the United States, had a net loss of $124 million vs. a profit of $603 million in the year-ago quarter. For the year, the North American unit, which includes Delphi Automotive Systems, earned $1.2 billion, down from $2.4 billion.
The automaker's international operations reported net income of $353 million for the quarter, down from $498 million a year ago. For all of 1996, GM's international profits were $1.5 billion, down from $1.6 billion in 1995.
Worldwide car and truck deliveries from GM dealers for the quarter were 1.9 million units vs. 2.02 million a year earlier. That reduced the automaker's worldwide market share to 15.5 percent for the quarter from 17.3 percent.
GM's U.S. market share also fell, to 30.2 percent in the fourth quarter from 33.5 percent a year ago. Unit deliveries in the United States were 1.08 million down from 1.20 million.
In his statement, Smith also blamed the lower 1996 results on production changeovers, higher advertising and ""consumer-influence"" expenses related to new-product launches. The average U.S. retail incentive for the fourth quarter was $739 a vehicle, up from $518.
""We have more new cars and trucks going into the market now than any time in the last 15 years,"" he said. ""In fact, about 20 percent of the 1997 production will be for the new models launched in 1996. Those new cars and trucks are key to our plans to aggressively increase market share in the United States this year.""

2686,"Bargaining between union and American Axle Manufacturing Inc. negotiators was expected to continue up to the midnight Friday deadline to avoid a strike that would quickly paralyze General Motors Corp.'s U.S. light truck production.
About 7,200 United Auto Workers union members were ready to walk off the job at five plants in Detroit, Three Rivers, Mich., and Buffalo, N.Y., if no agreement was reached on a new three-year contract.
American Axle, which was spun off from GM into a private company in 1994, supplies virtually all of the rear axles for GM's pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, axles for the Camero and Firebird rear-drive cars, as well as various parts for other passenger car lines.
The company also makes axles for Chrysler Corp. and axle shafts for Ford Motor Co..
Tight inventories at American Axle and Dana Corp., the other primary axle maker in the United States, means GM's light truck plants would run out of parts by early next week, analysts said.
""They can't have more than two days supply because there is no excess capacity in the industry,"" said James Harbour, president of Harbour &amp; Associates Inc., a Troy, Mich.-based consulting firm.
Burnham Securities Inc. analyst David Healy estimated GM could lose $20 million a day in after-tax profits if it was forced to suspend light truck production. Labor strife cost the world's largest automaker $1.2 billion in 1996.
The American Axle situation is the latest labor dispute to flare up in the automotive supplier industry since the beginning of the year. Analysts say they signal a new era as the UAW steps up efforts to organize more component workforces and bring pay levels in line with those of the Big Three.
""It's the next phase of the evolution of change,"" said Donna Parolini, president of International Business Development Corp., a Troy, Mich. supplier consulting firm.
UAW membership among independent, or non-Big Three, suppliers has dropped dramatically over the last 20 years so that now less than 20 percent of the independent parts workers belong to the UAW, she said.
The American Axle talks are notable because they mark the first time a GM spin-off has had to negotiate a new contract. When the firm was spun off under former Chrysler manufacturing chief Richard Dauch, it agreed to uphold terms of the previous UAW contract, which expired last September.
Union officials have said the company is balking at following the Big Three pattern deal hammered out last fall. That contract guarantees employment for 95 percent of current workers, and allows automakers to pay new hires at 70 percent of the starting base hourly wage of about $19.
Amrican Axle, however, wants to start new hires at 60 percent of the base wage -- and extend the time it takes to reach the full rate to six years. The Big Three pact has a ""grow-in"" rate of three years.
Last month, two Johnson Controls Inc. seat plants were hit with strikes by newly organized UAW workers. As of the Friday an agreement had not been reached in the 18-day-old strike.
The walkouts prompted Ford to take the unprecedented action of refusing to accept seats made by non-union replacements. Ford later signed up Johnson Controls' main competitor, Lear Corp., to supply it with seats for the Expedition full-size sport utility vehicle, one of those affected by the strike.
Parolini released figures Friday that showed the global supplier industry consolidating at a faster rate than previously thought. By the end of this year, there will be about 8,000 suppliers -- down from 30,000 in 1988.
In the past 22 months, there have been more than 320 acqusitions or mergers valued at a total of $32 billion. The mergers will likely result in layoffs as the companies seek to gain efficiencies. For instance, Parolini said companies such as Lear and Johnson Controls have issued internal mandates to reduce headcount by 20 percent next year.

About 7,200 UAW members were poised to walk off their jobs at five plants in Detroit, Three Rivers, Mich., and Buffalo, N.Y., if no agreement was reached on a new three-year contract. A person answering the phone at UAW Local 262 in Detroit said at midnight members had not received any official word the deadline had been extended.
A strike at American Axle could cripple the company's largest customer, General Motors Corp, within days.
The two sides are at odds over wages and other economic issues as the union seeks to impose on American Axle the same pattern contract the Big Three automakers agreed to for about 400,000 UAW members last fall. Automakers guaranteed jobs for 95 percent of their current workforce in a contract that provides $2,000 lump sum payments in the first year and wage hikes of three percent in the second and third years.

2688,"Chrysler Corp. Tuesday reported brisk sales of minivans and pickup trucks for August, pushing total U.S. sales for the automaker up 9 percent on a daily selling basis to 186,306.
The August total broke a company record for the month of 176,184 set in 1989.
Sales of light trucks, including popular Ram pickups and four-door minivans were 127,870, a 16.7 percent jump that marked the 11th consecutive month of rising light truck sales.
Domestically produced car sales came in weaker than some analysts had expected, falling 2 percent to 58,255 units.
Chrysler's strong light truck sales were helped by incentives on some Jeep sport utility models. Grand Cherokee sales rose 42 percent; Cherokee was up 52 percent; and Wrangler sales shot up 59 percent.
Total pickup sales were held back somewhat by low supplies of the Dakota, which is undergoing a model changeover. Dealers have a 35-day supply of the compact pickups -- about half of what the industry considers to be ideal.
Chrysler executives said they did not expect significant volumes of the new Dakotas to be available until October.
Steven Torok, executive director of sales and marketing operations, said Chrysler was not concerned about the slide in car sales. Total car sales were down 4 percent from August 1995, and off 24 percent from July.
August is often a seasonally weaker month than July, Torok said. Also, declines in the Dodge Stratus and Neon were partly attributable to model-year changeovers.
""Frankly, we saw our cars starting to firm up as the month went on, and we think we'll have a pretty good month in September,"" said Torok, adding September car sales will likely surpass those of August.
Torok said the No. 3 automaker was pleased with the breadth of its sales performance.
""What we see is a very even, consistent demand pattern,"" he said. ""Consumer sentiment seems to be not euphoric but consistent.""
Although car sales were slightly weaker, PaineWebber analyst Michael Ward said Chrysler's total numbers were still respectable because it was up against a strong year-ago performance.
Chrysler was the only one of the major automakers to report monthly sales on Tuesday. General Motors Corp. is scheduled to report sales Wednesday. Ward predicted it will post sales that are 4 percent to 5 percent below last year, with light trucks again offsetting weak car numbers.
Also on Tuesday, Subaru of America, a unit of Fuji Heavy Industries, reported U.S. sales up 18 percent to 10,361. Volvo Cars of North America, a unit of AB Volvo had August sales of 7,349, down almost 1 percent.

2689,"Ford Motor Co.'s sales tumbled 6.3 percent in the month of August as the No. 2 automaker reported worse-than-expected results Thursday in both its car and normally strong light truck business.
Ford reported U.S. sales of 297,726, down from 317,621 in the year-ago month. Sales of domestically produced cars fell 6.8 percent on a daily selling basis to 134,110. Sales of its pickup trucks, minivans and sport/utility vehicles totalled 161,549, a decline of 4.4 percent.
In a slight to Ford's quest for its Taurus to be the best-selling car for 1996, its sales for the first eight months slipped behind those of its nemisis, Honda Motor Co.'s Accord, by 1,409 units.
Results from Ford, the last automaker to report, capped a mixed month for Detroit's Big Three and contributed to a 2.3 percent total industry decline to 1,307,858 units for August.
Total sales of North American-built cars were off 6.7 percent to 608,140. That was partially offset by a 3.7 percent increase in domestically produced light trucks, to 513,376.
The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate finished the month at a healthy 15.8 million units. However, analysts said factors provided by the U.S. Department of Commerce to compute the rate artifically inflated it by about 500,000 units.
Those same factors made the July rate seem weak at 14.3 million units, analysts said. In August 1995, the rate was 15.7 million units, the second-highest of the year.
Ford portrayed its August sales slump as part of the expected drop-off in second-half sales for 1996.
""As anticipated, the automotive market has slowed somewhat since earlier this year,"" said Robert Rewey, Group Vice President of Marketing and Sales. ""In recent months we've seen interest rate increases for automotive financing that clearly have influenced industry-wide demand.""
Ford said vehicles sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 15.8 million unit sales for the first five months of 1996. The automaker continues to forecast 1996 total industry U.S. sales at 15.4 million to 15.5 million units. Sales for all of 1995 were 15.1 million.
At least one analyst welcomed the lower August industry numbers, saying they might make the Federal Reserve Board re-think any possible interest rate hikes.
""The lower the better,"" said Lehman Brothers analyst Joeseph Phillippi. ""Maybe they'll keep the Fed quiet.""
In August, Ford's normally strong light truck business was hurt by a decline in government sales, competitive pricing pressures and production shortages of key F-150 models.
F-Series sales inched up 1.7 percent to 58,095.
Explorer sales, which have fallen in recent months due to the production startup of its sister, the Mercury Mountaineer, were down almost 11 percent to 27,615.
On the car side, Contour sales sank 35 percent to 10,487, while Mystique sales were down 18 percent to 5,041. Taurus sales were 25,570, a 2 percent increase, which brought total sales this year to 250,212. But that was not enough to top the Accord, which sold 251,621 cars year-to-date.
Ford said it has scheduled a nearly 14 percent increase in fourth-quarter North American truck production, to 632,000 units, to meet expected future demand for its popular F-Series.
Car production is scheduled to fall 4 percent to 431,000 for the same period. Total fourth-quarter North American output is forecast at 1,063,000, an increase of about 5 percent from the fourth quarter of 1995.
On Wednesday, General Motors Corp. said total car and truck sales fell 7.9 percent, led by a nearly 14 percent drop in passenger car sales.
Chrysler Corp. was the only one of the Big Three to post a sales increase. It reported earlier this week that sales rose 9.2 percent, helped by a strong performance from minivans, sport/utilities and pickup trucks.

2695,"Daily circulation at Detroit's two strike-bound newspapers fell by a third in the first quarter of 1996 from a year ago, according to the first audited figures released since the strike began.
Combined daily circulation of the Free Press and Detroit News was down 33 percent at 576,698 for the January-through-March period, Detroit Newspapers Inc., the joint operating agency that runs two papers, said Friday.
The number, as verified by the Audit Bureau of Circulations, was below the 624,980 that the papers say they distributed, because ABC could not confirm payment or collection for all the papers.
The circulation drop from the same three months in 1995 roughly coincides with the 25 percent to 30 percent decline newspaper officials have acknowledged since the strike began in July 1995.
About 2,500 pressroom, mailroom, delivery and newsroom employees from six unions walked off the job in a dispute over proposed work rule changes and job cuts. Knight-Ridder Inc. owns the Free Press. The News is owned by Gannett Co. Inc..
Circulation for the combined Sunday edition as counted by the Audit Bureau declined to 769,594, a 29 percent drop from 1,085,677 in the year-ago period. Detroit Newspapers said they distributed 844,335 combined Sunday papers.
The Audit Bureau, which contacted thousands of subscribers, had trouble guaranteeing that all of the subscriptions had been paid. They also found some readers were reluctant to admit they read the struck papers, the newspapers said.
Detroit Newspapers officials said they have concentrated more on delivering papers during the strike than on collecting for them.
""As time has gone by, we have been increasingly successful at re-establishing all of our distribution procedures, including billing and collection,"" said Rob Althaus, senior vice president of circulation, in a statement.
The newspapers said their combined daily net paid circulation in the April-through-August period has increased by 25,000, or 4.5 percent, using the Audit Bureau criteria for calculating paid subscribers. Sunday circulation for the same period grew by 18,000, or 2.4 percent.
Roger Kerson, a spokesman for the striking unions, said the audited figures reinforce the unions' position that it was too costly to produce papers under strike conditions.
""They show a critical and devastating loss of readership,"" said Kerson. ""I hope the admission of these horrible circulation numbers will lead to some (bargaining) progress.""
No negotiations were held this week, although some meetings are scheduled for next week, the papers said.

2696,"A commuter plane heading for Detroit in a heavy snowstorm crashed in a remote wooded area south of the city on Thursday, killing all 30 on board, officials said.
The Embraer-120, operated as flight 3272 by Comair, a regional carrier based in Cincinnati, crashed at 3:50 p.m. EST (2050 GMT) near the town of Ida about 25 miles (40 km) from Detroit near the Raisin River.
Comair operates as a feeder for Delta Airlines.
A nearby resident, Thomas Marino, said he heard the plane flying low overhead while shoveling snow off his driveway.
""I heard a jet flying very low. Then a loud boom, a vibration. I didn't see the fireball,"" he told Reuters. ""It sounded low, but planes fly low all the time over here, especially when it's overcast.""
Much of the region had been hit by a storm which dumped a half foot (15 cm) or more of snow. There was no confirmation, however, that weather played a role in the crash.
Marino said he drove one-half mile (0.8 km) to the crash site, but could only see smoke and rescue workers swarming around.
He said the plane crashed into what looked like a farm field, just south of the Raisin River.
Television film footage showed only a blackened gash in a snowy field.
The National Transportation Safety Board in Washington said the plane carried 25 passengers, two pilots and three flight attendants and that none survived.
The flight originated in Cincinnati.
One man who lived near the crash site told a Detroit radio station there was an ""unbelievable"" explosion and fireball when the plane crashed.
Any plane carrying 70 or less is considered a commuter flight though some routinely operate under the same safety and flight rules that govern larger aircraft.
In October 1994, icing caused a French-built American Eagle ATR-72 to crash in northern Indiana, killing all 68 on board. The plane's manufacturer later made revisions to de-icing equipment.
CNN reported that the Brazilian-made Embraer-120 has been involved in 13 other crashes since 1986 where lives were lost, including an accident in Georgia that killed former Senator John Tower.

2701,"Boeing Co.'s engineers union said Wednesday it has filed a charge of unfair labour practices over the aerospace giant's decision to merge its training unit into a new venture with FlightSafety International.
The Seattle Professional Engineering Employees Assocation, which represents more than 23,000 mostly white-collar workers at Boeing, said it filed a complaint asking the National Labour Relations Board to prevent Boeing from completing its deal until the legal issues are resolved.
Charles Bofferding, executive director of SPEEA, said the union had begun negotiations with Boeing after being surprised by the March 10 announcement of the deal with FlightSafety, which affects more than 600 Boeing employees, including about 240 union members.
Under the deal, Boeing and FlightSafety, a unit of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc., each would contribute $100 million in assets to create an international training company for commercial jet pilots and ground crews.
Bofferding said Boeing already has agreed to guarantee that employees will be offered other jobs at Boeing if they do not get similar positions in the new venture, known as FlightSafety Boeing Training International.
But he was not optimistic Boeing would agree to union demands that engineers who switch to the new venture will be allowed to keep their Boeing wages and benefits as well as union membership.
""Those two issues frankly we don't think we're going to clear up in negotiations,"" Bofferding said. ""It's very clear the company wants to give these people FlightSafety International benefits and strip away these people's union representation.""
A Boeing official said in a statement the company was ""disappointed"" the union felt a need to file the charge with the NLRB.
""We recognise our obligation to engage in these discussions with the union and welcome the opportunity to do so,"" said the official, Sants Contreras.  ""We have worked very hard over the last three years to build a strong, cooperative relationship with SPEEA, and we hoped to have more time to meet with the union on their concerns before they took this type of action.""

2705,"Computer giants Microsoft Corp , Intel and Compaq Computer Corp have proposed standards for a new generation of televisions that would be compatible with an emerging class of personal computers for the home.
In a telephone briefing with reporters, Microsoft Senior Vice President Craig Mundie said on Monday the proposed television protocol -- unveiled at a broadcasters' conference in Las Vegas -- would be recommended also as a standard for multimedia Pcs.
Mundie said the companies, dubbed the ""Big Three"" of the personal computer industry, are proposing adoption of three out of 18 advanced technical standards set forth by a television industry coalition.
Mundie and executives from Intel and Compaq said their proposal would allow a ""significant improvement"" in picture quality as well as transmission of related information and data to personal computers, television and hybrid devices.
""This model of television in particular is going to provide the viewer with a completely different experience,"" said Robert Stearns, senior vice president of Compaq.
He suggested that advanced television, also known as high-definition television, would allow viewers greater opportunity to interact with programming by choosing camera angles, chatting with characters, responding to advertising and even affecting the outcome of shows.
He said that beyond the issues of ""plumbing"" or technical standards, the broadcast industry could develop new revenue streams from advanced television.
He and the other executives said equipping personal computers to decode and display the new forms of television signals would add very little to the cost of the devices, perhaps less than $150.
At the same time, the emergence of advanced television is creating a new class of big-screen personal computers which combine features of the computer and television.
The consumer electronics industry is gearing up for production of advanced television sets with sophisticated computer circuitry.
Last week, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, culminating a 10-year effort, called for a rollout of the technology that will have digital television on the air in the nation's 10 biggest markets within 18 months.
But rather than set specific technical standards for advanced television, the agency essentially is allowing the industry and marketplace to decide, Mundie said.
Placing a major bet on the coming convergence of computers and television, Microsoft over the weekend agreed in a $425 million deal to buy WebTV Networks Inc., which provides a way for consumers to access the Internet on their TV screens.
Raising the ante further, Mundie said Microsft planned to include technology needed for its preferred television standards in forthcoming versions of its Windows 95 and Windows NT operating systems.
That would mean competing television standards would be incompatible with Windows-based computers.

Several other timber industry companies also reported comparatively weak fourth-quarter results blamed on poor market conditions.
For the fourth quarter Weyerhaeuser posted earnings of $98 million or 50 cents a share, compared with $251 million or $1.25 a share a year earlier. Revenues in the quarter fell to $2.8 billion from $3.1 billion.
The earnings figure was above the Wall Street consensus of 48 cents a share mainly because of strong operating earnings in the company's real estate business, analysts said.
But Weyerhaeuser closed off $1 at $49.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.
For the year Weyerhaeuser, based in Federal Way, Wash., reported net income of $463 million or $2.34 a share, down from $983 million or $4.83 a share before a special charge in 1995.  Revenues for the year fell to $11.1 billion from $11.8 billion.
""1996 was a year of mixed results,""  said John Creighton, Weyerhaeuser president and chief executive officer, who cited lower pulp and paper prices but ""solid demand"" for wood products in the United States and Japan.
Pulp and paper operating earnings for the year fell to $307 million from a record $1.18 billion in 1995. Earnings from timberlands and wood products were virtually flat at $805 million, compared with $808 million.
Portland, Ore.-based Louisiana-Pacific Corp. reported a net loss for the fourth quarter of $14.7 million, or 14 cents a share, on sales of $567 million, compared with net income of $26.8 million or 25 cents a share on sales of $670.3 million a year earlier.
For the year the company reported a net loss of $201 million, or $1.87 a share, blamed mainly on a pre-tax charge of $350 million for the closing of its pulp mill in Ketchikan, Alaska.
In 1995 the company had a loss of $51.7 million or 48 cents a share including a pretax charge of $366.6 million mainly to account for the settlement of class-action lawsuits over the company's siding.
Louisiana-Pacific chairman and chief executive officer Mark Suwyn said the company had resolved key legal and organisational issues in 1996 but still faced an oversupply in the market for its key product of oriented strand board, used in building.
Louisiana-Pacific stock closed up 25 cents at $21.
Clayton, Mo.-based Jefferson Smurfit Corp. posted net income of $14 million, or 13 cents a share, for the fourth quarter, down from $64 million, or 57 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales for the quarter were $816 million, compared with $973 million.
For the full year the company earned $112 million, or $1.01 a share, compared with $243 million, or $2.19 a share. Sales fell to $3.4 billion from $4.1 billion in 1995.
Company president and chief executive officer Richard Graham said inventories in containerboard and newsprint have declined steadily over the past several months, promising some relief to the weak pricing environment.
""Given continued economic expansion, we could see a recovery in the company's principal markets during the second half of 1997,"" he said.

2711,"Edmark Corp, a U.S. maker of educational computer software for children, said on Monday that chairman and chief executive Sally Narodick had resigned for stress-related health reasons.
The company said Donna Stanger, vice-president for product development, would temporarily assume the duties of chief executive while the board of directors searched for a permanent successor.
Frances Conley, a director of the company and principal of Roanoke Capital Ltd, will serve as chairman of the board.
""As you can well imagine, it's an extremely difficult thing for me to acknowledge that I'm not a rock and I'm not invincible, and I'm having a tough time with that,"" Narodick told a news conference.
She said she first began experiencing symptoms including fatigue in June and took a two-week holiday. After returning to work, she again suffered symptoms including fatigue, insomnia and weight loss.
Late last month her doctors recommended that she take steps to lower her stress level.  
""I don't have energy... It's pretty clear that I need to take quite a bit of time off to rest and heal myself, and in this kind of environment the company needs somebody who's going to be fully in charge."" Narodick said.
Her resignation comes at a time when the market for educational software is increasingly crowded, forcing Edmark and its rivals to drive down prices and compete fiercely for precious shelf space.
Edmark officials declined to comment on persistent speculation within the industry that the company might become a takeover candidate but said the change in top management would not alter their options.
Stanger said the company could continue to be a ""very strong niche player"" or could elect to merge ""if the need for scale becomes important enough"".
Conley said Edmark would survive the current turmoil within the company and the industry, noting the company's talent pool of more than 200 employees and strong balance sheet including more than $25 million in cash as of June 30.
Narodick, who said she had ""great confidence"" in Stanger, will remain on Edmark's board.

2719,"Teledesic Inc., the communications startup mostly owned by Seattle billionaires Bill Gates and Craig McCaw, Tuesday picked Boeing Co. to build and deploy its planned $9 billion satellite network.
Boeing also will invest up to $100 million in Teledesic, giving it a 10 percent stake in the privately-held company, which plans to launch 288 low-orbiting satellites by 2002 to form an ""Internet in the sky.""
Teledesic Chief Executive Officer David Twyver said the Kirkland, Wash.-based company talked to virtually all the world's major aerospace companies before settling on Seattle neighbour Boeing as prime contractor for the ambitious project.
""But let me say that no one company can do everything that has to be done here,"" Twyver said in an interview.
""We expect that most of the major aerospace and telecommunications companies if they're interested in being part of this will find room in it,"" he said.
The contract is a major victory for Boeing, which is counting on commercial ventures to provide growth for its rapidly expanding defence and space business
Boeing's partly-owned Sea Launch Co. is building a mobile, ocean-based satellite launch platform, and the aerospace giant is expanding its space business aggressively through the recently completed acquisition of Rockwell International Corp. units and the planned purchase of McDonnell Douglas Corp.
""Our relationship with Teledesic is the perfect catalyst for bringing together all of our historical investments in the space business with our recent and planned investments in Sea Launch, Rockwell and McDonnell Douglas,"" Boeing Chief Executive Phil Condit said.
Teledesic, initially formed by McCaw, a pioneer in the cellular telephone industry, and Gates, co-founder and chairman of Microsoft Corp., has scaled back its initial plans for a network of 840 small satellites more than 400 miles in the air, Twyver said.
Instead, the company now plans to provide the same international coverage with a network of slightly larger satellites orbiting about twice as high above the earth -- still far lower than current communications satellites launched into geosynchronous orbit 22,500 miles up.
Teledesic executives say their network will provide communication comparable to land-based fiber optics, including transmission of voice, data and video, between any two points on Earth equipped with the small dishes needed to link to the low-orbiting satellites.
Other satellite projects in the works, such as Motorola Inc.'s 66-satellite Iridium project, aim to provide voice and data links to mobile users, more like today's cellular telephones.
""We expect our customers to be companies rather than individuals, initially at least,"" Twyver said. ""Almost every company now is putting mission-critical internal applications on Internet-style backbones, and they'll need to get access to every one of their sites.""
Teledesic plans to market the service directly in the United States and is in talks with major telecommunications companies overseas for resale rights.
Twyver said Teledesic is ""very well funded"" now but will be looking for other industrial risk-sharing partners to build out the network.
Boeing likely will build the satellites at a cost of several million dollars each on a mass-production line in its current facilities.
Up to 16 satellites then will be packed onto each rocket for launch over an 18-month period beginning in 2001. Various launch vehicles are expected to be used.
Twyver said the production schedule allows for an 8 percent satellite failure rate, which he said was cheaper than insuring every satellite.
The final configuration will include 12 ""beaded necklaces"" of 24 satellites each orbiting the Earth in different planes, with the option of adding more satellites later.
With the Boeing investment, Gates and McCaw each will own about one-third of Teledesic. AT&amp;T Co.'s AT&amp;T Wireless, which bought McCaw's cellular business, owns about 10 percent of Teledesic, with venture capital investors owning the rest.

2722,"Boeing Co. said Monday first-quarter profit more than doubled and sales rose 70 percent as it ramped up airplane production, but the results disappointed Wall Street and the company's stock tumbled.
Boeing said it earned $313 million, or 87 cents a share, in the quarter, excluding an accounting credit, compared with $119 million, or 35 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue soared to $7.32 billion from $4.29 billion.
But the net income was 13 percent below the Wall Street consensus of $1 a share, according to First Call, and Boeing stock lost $5.50 to $96.50 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
""The stock is down because earnings came in quite a bit below the consensus. That's it in a nutshell,"" said Peter Jacobs, an analyst at Ragen MacKenzie in Seattle.
Analysts said Boeing's earnings were hurt by higher-than-expected research and development expenses for new airplane models and other projects including a commercial space venture.
The company also said it was incurring significant overtime costs as it increases production to meet rising demand and warned that profit margins would be under pressure for the rest of the year.
""It's sort of a wake-up call to some analysts who I think have been a little too optimistic about their margins,"" said Bob Toomey at Piper Jaffray.
Boeing said profit margins would be lower for the rest of the year because of growing deliveries of the new 777 and next-generation 737 models. New models carry lower profit margins until the company has written down the costs of production equipment.
""The fundamentals remain as strong as ever -- they remain excellent,"" Toomey said. ""They'll work through this problem.""
Boeing delivered 68 commercial aircraft in the quarter, up from 40 in the year-earlier period when production was still hampered by the effects of a 10-week strike.
For this year, Boeing reiterated that it expects to deliver 340 jets and generate revenue of $33 billion, compared with 218 jets and revenues of $22.7 billion last year.
That does not include the planned acquisition of McDonnell Douglas Corp., which Boeing executives say will be completed in August and which will add about $15 billion of annual revenue.
Analysts expect Boeing production to continue rising in 1998 to about 450 jets as the world's biggest commercial planemaker works to meet surging industry demand.
""You expect that if you're ramping up rates there would be some costs incurred, and that's clearly what's happening,"" said Wolfgang Demisch of BT Securities.
But he said he was encouraged that Boeing still expects to meet its production target for the year.
""There always is a significant risk of running into some sort of shortfall, and all of a sudden you wind up with airplanes that ... are most of the way done and missing some critical parts,"" he said.
That happened to Boeing in the late 1960s, when the company nearly went bankrupt, he said.
This time around there is no such danger, as the company said it had $5.5 billion in cash at the end of the quarter, up slightly from three months early. Boeing's backlog rose to $89.2 billion from $87.7 billion three months earlier, chiefly because of new defence contracts.
Boeing also recorded a $64 million accounting credit related to an employee-benefit trust fund.
Boeing shares were also pressured by other factors.
The London Times reported on Saturday that Boeing competitors Lockheed Martin Corp. and Airbus Industrie were discussing a possible merger.
In addition, the European Union and U.S. officials have begun talks on European complaints about U.S. subsidies to aircraft makers, and Boeing fears the outcome will be linked to an EU decision on its planned takeover of McDonnell Douglas, traders said.
""The earnings are not quite up to par, and the other stories are not helping,"" one trader said.

2731,"Microsoft Corp. Tuesday fired the latest salvo in its battle with rival Netscape Communications Corp. as it unveiled the latest version of its Internet Explorer browser.
Version 4.0 of the Microsoft browser was posted on the Internet (http://www.microsoft.com/ie), but the company cautioned that the ""platform preview release"" was only for developers and technical evaluators.
Meanwhile Netscape this week released a third ""platform preview"" version of its competing Communicator suite of Internet products, which includes its popular Navigator browser.
Microsoft's browser will be finalized by sometime in ""midsummer,"" a company executive said, while the Netscape package will be available commercially this quarter.
""Having a browser beta that is such an early beta out in the public hands is something that would never have happened two years ago,"" said Annette Hamilton of ZDNet AnchorDesk, referring to the Microsoft preview release.
""The reason it is happening is there is so much intense competition,""she said. ""They don't want to lose momentum.""
Until last year Navigator dominated the emerging Internet market with an overwhelming market share of about 90 percent, but with the release of version 3.0 of Internet Explorer, Microsoft has come back to capture up to one third of the market.
Microsoft gives away its browser for free, and many customers pay only small licensing fees for current Navigator versions. But the market battle is crucial in Microsoft's effort to maintain its dominance of the personal computer industry by controlling the operating system.
In fact the new version of Internet Explorer can be integrated into the Windows 95 desktop and so users can ""browse"" for information either on the individual computer or out on the Internet.
The browser ultimately will be integrated into an update of the Windows 95 operating system, expected sometime next year.
Microsoft also said the new browser can be programmed to automatically check for updates to frequent Web sites and to allow for ""Webcasting"" by content providers that will be able to offer subscriptions.
""We've combined push capabilities, (computer) desktop integration and the latest in browsing and communication technologies to deliver the best of the PC and the best of the Web,"" said Brad Chase, vice president of Microsoft's applications and Internet client group.
The initial version of Internet Explorer 4.0 will be available only for Microsoft's Windows 95 platofrm, although the company also is working on versions for Windows 3.1, Macintosh and Unix, officials said.
Meanwhile Netscape's Communicator, which will cost $59 for individual licenses, will work on all platforms, said Daniel Klaussen, a group product manager for the company.
""Not much is given away in the world,"" he said, referring to Microsoft's browser. ""For its business model to work Microsoft really needs users to upgrade to their latest operating system, and of course that is not free.""
Internet Explorer 4.0 also includes Outlook Express, which gives users advanced e-mail and other capabilities; Microsoft NetMeeting, software that allows video conferencing; and Microsoft NetShow, software that enables Web publishers to offer live ""Webcasts"" as well as video and multimedia on demand by computer users.

2732,"Boeing Co. plans to enter the airline maintenance business within the next several months as part of a drive by the jet manufacturer to develop new business opportunities, a top executive said Friday.
""It's one of the things we're looking at, and I'm quite sure we're going to do it,"" said Larry Clarkson, president of Boeing Enterprises, a new division of the company's commercial airplane group.
Clarkson said in an interview the company is negotiating with several potential partners, which he declined to identify, and might begin by forming a joint venture to provide maintenance for airlines that want to use outside contractors for the business.
The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Boeing was pushing to take over the heavy-maintenance operations of several major carriers, possibly including British Airways Plc, but Clarkson said any such transaction would be a long way off.
""When it comes to, say, taking over the total maintenance of a major airline, it's going to take us a while,"" Clarkson said. ""It's a very complicated thing to do.""
A spokeswoman for British Airways declined comment.
Industry analysts said a move by Boeing into maintenance would make sense as a way to diversify the company's business beyond highly cyclical airplane manufacturing and weapons systems.
""If you can get into that business without stepping on your customer's toes I think it's a great idea,"" said Bill Whitlow of Pacific Crest Securities.
He and other analysts said the move was a reflection of Chief Executive Officer Phil Condit's efforts to diversify Boeing while the manufacturer is enjoying a record wave of new orders.
""This is a reflection of Phil Condit and his more aggressive nature than his predecessor and a reflection of the internal thinking that's going on as to where best could they deploy the huge amount of cash they're going to have on hand,"" said Paul Nisbet of JSA Research.
Boeing had $4.4 billion in cash at the end of last year, and Nisbet estimated that with the company's expected acquisition of McDonnell Douglas Corp. this year it will generate at least $1.5 billion in excess cash annually over the next several years.
Last month Boeing Enterprises announced a $200 million joint venture with FlightSafety International to offer pilot and ground crew training. FlightSafety is a unit of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
The Boeing unit, formed in January, also has been exploring ways to profitably use the company's massive database of world airline inventories to help carriers maintain service records.

2736,"The Japanese aerospace industry is likely to become the largest international supplier of structural parts for the planned next-generation Boeing 747 jumbo jet, officials of the manufacturer said Thursday.
Discussions between Boeing and Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd, Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd are aimed at significantly expanding the role of the Japanese manufacturers in producing two planned ""stretch"" versions of the 747, officials of the Seattle-based company said.  
""The discussions will go on until later in the year, but it is likely the Japanese industry will end up being the largest international supplier of parts for the 747-500x and -600x,"" said Susan Davis, a Boeing spokeswoman.
While the three Japanese manufacturers provide structural parts for most Boeing models, they do not rank among the top 10 suppliers for the current-generation 747, another Boeing official said.  
The 500x currently being offered to airlines would hold 462 passengers in a typical three-class configuration and have a range of 10,000 miles, compared with 416 passengers and 8,400 miles for the 747-400. The 600x would hold 548 and have a range of 8,900 miles.
The three so-called Japanese ""heavies"" already are significant Boeing partners, building about 20 percent of the structural parts for the new 777 as well as wing components and other parts for the current 747 jumbo.  
The Japanese manufacturers likely will produce 747 wing flight-control surfaces and landing-gear doors as well as fairings that join the wings to the body.
The components under discussion are provided by outside suppliers for the current 747 model with the exception of the fairings, which are made at Boeing's plant in Winnipeg, Manitoba, the site of a recent five-week strike.
In remarks last week to a group marking a century of trade between Japan and Seattle, Boeing chief executive Phil Condit said Japan Airlines Co Ltd is the company's biggest customer for 747s, having taken delivery of 96 since 1970.
""We strongly believe that strengthening of ties between our two countries remains crucial for the future,"" he said.
Boeing hopes that by increasing the participation of Japanese manufacturers, the company will increase its chances of landing future orders from that country's airlines, although Davis noted that there was ""no guarantee.""
""They provide high-quality parts at competitive prices,"" she said. ""If it does happen to increase sales, it increases the work here in the U.S. too.""

2752,"Chinese President Jiang Zemin, seeking to ensure his grip on power after the death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, called on the army on Tuesday to obey only the ruling Communist Party.
The People's Liberation Army, whose backing Jiang needs to ensure political control, should toe the party line, Jiang told a meeting of army delegates to the National People's Congress, or parliament.
""On this vital political issue that concerns the future and destiny of the party, the state and the nation, there must not be the slightest ambiguity or vacillation,"" the official Xinhua news agency quoted Jiang as saying.
Jiang, who also holds the posts of Communist Party chief and chairman of the powerful Central Military Commission, never served in the armed forces and has tried hard to win army support to bolster his position as Deng's political heir.
Deng died on February 19 aged 92.
Jiang has since moved to cement his position as China's supreme ruler, urging the nation to rally around the party with him at its core.
On Tuesday, Jiang called on army members of parliament to ""seek no fame, status and promotion (and) give priority to the party"", Xinhua said.
""Our army has always followed what the party says,"" he told the meeting, which was attended by generals Liu Huaqing, Zhang Zhen, Zhang Wan'nian and Chi Haotian. All of them are vice-chairmen of the military commission while Chi also serves as defence minister.
Jiang told his audience that the party's leadership had enabled military victories of the past and made the armed forces stronger.
But he said the drive to modernise the three million strong army had created a range of problems and warned officers not to step outside the law while performing their duties.
""Cadres at various levels must run the army with strict discipline and according to law and do their routine ideological and managerial work in a meticulous way,"" he said.
The army that ushered in nearly five decades of communist rule has benefited immensely from capitalist-style reforms launched by Deng in the late 1970s, running luxury hotels, factories and dealing in real estate.
Told by Beijing to make money for itself to supplement its budget, the army has also been widely accused of smuggling and other official abuses of power in its drive to do so.
China has set a defence budget of 80.6 billion yuan ($9.7 billion) this year, a rise of 12.7 percent over actual spending for 1996.
Western military analysts say total defence spending is considerably higher than the published figures.
Beijing defends its hefty increases in military spending by saying the base figure is still low and inflation has cut buying power.

2754,"China's largest zinc producer, Liuzhou Zinc Products Co, is tormented by water: there's either too much or too little.
The plant in the southern region of Guangxi struggles to stay open against fierce summer floods while low river water levels in winter often rob the factory of the hydropower it needs to keep its production lines running, officials said.
Average production at the plant fell to about 88 percent of capacity last year from a previous 95 percent after torrential summer rains flooded some 90 percent of the factory grounds, Jiang Wenjie, deputy director of the plant, said.
The high waters caused about 80 million yuan ($9.6 million) in damage and forced the closure of a zinc oxide production line for three months, Jiang told Reuters in an interview.
Damage from the floods has since been repaired and 1997 output will rise above last year's, he said.
""We see output of all our products hitting 95 percent of capacity this year,"" he said.
No visible traces remain of last year's floods but a recent tour of the factory grounds revealed workers standing idle because a power outage had shut down all production lines.
""This happens often in winter because water levels are too low to generate power,"" said one official, who asked not be identified.
The power outages had been worked into production plans, he said.
RISING PROFITS, SHARE LISTING SEEN IN 1997
Last year's floods had cut into the company's profits, which fell to an after-tax 10.32 million yuan last year on sales of 608 million yuan, Jiang said.
Profits were just half of those in 1995, Jiang said, but forecast they would rise to about 21 million yuan this year.
Sales were seen at 630 million yuan in 1997, he said.
The company's production of zinc ingots was seen hitting 33,200 tonnes in 1997 while output of zinc oxide would top 50,000 tonnes, he said.
""With the development of China's automobile and construction industries...the market for zinc oxide will increase gradually,"" he said.
China had some 40 plants turning out 170,000 tonnes of zinc oxide annually, he said, adding that domestic demand was about 130,000 tonnes a year.
The smelter's output of zinc alloys would hit 1,900 tonnes in 1997, output of zinc sulphate 3,800 tonnes and that of zinc powder about 1,700 tonnes, he said.
Production of lithopone, used in low-grade paints, would reach 28,500 tonnes but domestic demand was expected to slump as rising living standards fuelled the market for higher quality paints, he said.
Liuzhou Zinc had fixed assets of 250 million yuan, a registered capital of 101.5 million yuan and was 79.41 percent state-owned, Jiang said.
The firm had applied to list domestic currency A shares on the stock market in the southern town of Shenzhen, he said.
""We expect approval by the end of this year,"" he said but declined to give further details.
EXPORT TARIFF CUT NOT HELPFUL
Jiang gave a lukewarm welcome to a recent central government decision to cut zinc export tariffs in 1997.
Beijing's move to lower the temporary export tariff on zinc to zero in 1997 from 5.0 percent last year would have little effect on the plant's exports due to government quotas on the metal, Jiang said.
""Our exports won't be more than 20 percent of our output this year,"" he said.
That compared to exports of 45 percent of production in 1993, he said.
""There are still quotas on zinc exports,"" he said.
""The central government still has controls over the zinc industry,"" he said. ""They want to ensure domestic demand is met.""
EXPORTS TO GROW
The plant would export its products to 20 countries in 1997, he said.
Zinc oxide exports would head mainly to the United States, Japan, South Korea and southeast Asia, Jiang said but declined to give further details.
China produced about 1.07 million tonnes of zinc last year, down 0.32 percent from 1995, official figures show. Zinc output in December alone was 94,900 tonnes.
Domestic zinc demand is seen hitting 870,000 tonnes in 1997, up 6.1 percent from last year, the figures show.
The smelter sourced about 85 percent of its supply of zinc concentrate from mines in Guangxi, the southern province of Guangdong and Yunnan province in the southwest, he said.
The plant would not import zinc concentrate within the next five years, he said.

2757,"Chinese police cordoned off a South Korean embassy compound and North Korean diplomats waited outside as a senior Seoul official was due for talks with Beijing on the apparent defection of a top Pyongyang official.
Dozens of Chinese police blocked streets to South Korea's consular section in the sedate, tree-lined diplomatic district of Beijing, and embassy officials said Hwang Jang-yop, a senior aide to the North's leader Kim Jong-il, was holed up inside.
China remained silent as it found itself at the centre of a diplomatic crisis involving its old communist comrade, Pyongyang, and new commercial ally, Seoul.
South Korea sent Kim Ha-jung, a special adviser to Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha, to Beijing on Thursday morning for talks with Chinese officials on the fate of Hwang who it said had sought asylum along with his assistant Kim Dok-hong.
In a sign of the suspicion that underscores dealings between North and South, South Korean embassy officials accused North Koreans of trying to force their way into the consular office.
Diplomats from Pyongyang sat in parked cars outside the consular compound and waited outside the embassy, watching from behind the police cordons.
""Last night, North Korean people who we believe were from the embassy tried to enter our consular section,"" embassy spokesman Chang Moon-Ik told reporters.
Chinese police on guard around the compound had prevented the North Koreans from entering, he said.
He dismissed Pyongyang's charges that Hwang, one of 11 secretaries on the powerful secretariat of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party, Jong-il, had been kidnapped by the South, saying Hwang had voluntarily sought asylum.
""He came by taxi without any notice,"" the spokesman said.
North Korean diplomats stood by the kidnapping charge.
""I think South Korea has kidnapped these two officials,"" said one of several North Korean officials waiting in the office tower housing Seoul's embassy. ""The impossible has happened.""
An official at the North Korean embassy repeated a Pyongyang Foreign Ministry statement that accused Seoul of kidnapping Hwang and urged Beijing to sort out the mess.
""If it is brought to light that the South Korean authorities kidnapped him and describe him as seeking 'asylum', we will regard it as a serious incident without precedent and take due countermeasures,"" the Korean Central News Agency quoted a Pyongyang Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying.
""We expect that the Chinese side will take appropriate measures in this regard,"" the spokesman added.
Beijing is caught in the wrangle between North Korea, one of its last remaining socialist allies, and the capitalist South, which has become an important trading partner and source of investment.
Hwang, 73, is one of the chief architects of North Korean communism, and would be the highest ranking Pyongyang official ever to seek asylum in the South.
He is credited with playing a leading role in shaping the policy of Juche, a brand of fanatic self-reliance providing the ideological underpinning for the world's last Stalinist state.
South and North Korea were separated at the end of World War Two and fought a war from 1950 to 1953. China fought on North Korea's side in the conflict.

""There has been no big change in Comrade Deng Xiaoping's health,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang told a news briefing, but gave no details of what would constitute a major change in the health of the fragile 92-year-old patriach.
Tang declined to comment when asked if there had been a small change.
Officials of the State Council, or cabinet, were unable to give their usual official response to queries about Deng's health -- that he is as well as can be expected for a man of his age -- saying merely they were investigating the situation.
Chinese sources said on Monday that Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng both cut short out-of-town trips last weekend to return to Beijing to visit Deng.
Officials declined to comment directly on a tide of rumours washing around the Chinese capital that Deng's physical condition has deteriorated or that he suffered a stroke.
In Taipei, the mass circulation United Daily News quoted the top policymaker on mainland affairs, Chang King-yuh, as describing Deng's condition as serious. Officials said they were closely monitoring the Chinese leader's health.
Party chief Jiang, who is also state president and head of the army, returned at the weekend, cutting short an unpublicised visit to the communist revolutionary base of Ganzhou in central Jiangxi province, said one Chinese source close to the party.
Premier Li Peng also flew back to Beijing at the weekend, abruptly curtailing a tour of the booming southern province of Guangdong because of Deng's deteriorating health, said the source, who asked not to be identified. Officials in Guangdong confirmed Li had left early.
The two leaders returned to Beijing where they visited Deng, the source said.
Deng, whose pragmatic policies transformed a backward Stalinist state into an economic powerhouse, lives in a tightly-guarded central Beijing compound close to the Forbidden City, home for centuries to China's emperors.
Diplomats have said one barometer of Deng's health in China's highly-secretive political system is the travel of top leaders and close family members, with few considered willing to be caught out of town or abroad if Deng were close to death.
Vice-Premier Li Lanqing was abroad on a visit to Israel and Iran, and Defence Minister Chi Haotian was in the Philippines, where officials said he would not change his travel plans.
A Hong Kong newspaper reported at the weekend that the architect of China's sweeping economic reforms was rushed to hospital last Thursday after a huge stroke that followed an earlier, mild stroke.
Doctors said that if Deng's stroke had been a haemorrhage he could have died within hours, while if it was a thrombosis, or formation of a blood clot, he could last days or weeks.
Rumours about Deng's health surface periodically and often have a direct impact on China-related bourses, where Deng's demise is seen by some as a potentially destabilising factor.
Worries over Deng's health helped to push shares on Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges sharply lower by their close on Tuesday and also rocked share prices in Taiwan and Hong Kong.
Deng has not been seen in public since the 1994 Chinese Lunar New Year festival when he appeared frail and faltering on a visit to Shanghai. He is now believed to be in fragile health and with fading lucidity.
Deng retired from his last official position in 1990, but China's elderly leaders exert great influence after their retirement in a society where age is revered and in a communist system in which officials spend years building up a power base.

2764,"A South Korean official on Tuesday said progress had been made in talks with China over the fate of the most senior leader to flee Pyongyang but terms of his departure from Beijing were still undecided.
Hwang Jang-yop, a senior North Korean ideologue and top aide to supreme leader Kim Jong-il, has been stranded in Seoul's mission in Beijing since February 12 while the three nations negotiate his fate.
""There has been some headway. Negotiations are still going on,"" said Chang Moon-ik, spokesman for the South Korean embassy in Beijing.
Officials in South Korea said on Monday they expected a breakthrough this week in talks with China aimed at securing Hwang's passage out of Beijing but Chang said it was unlikely he would be moved in the next few days.
""Final arrangements have yet to be done first. There has been no final decision,"" Chang said by telephone.
Weeks of talks over Hwang's fate, interrupted by the death of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping last month, have failed to produce an accord as Beijing finds itself torn between an old communist ally and a new capitalist friend.
""We want to bring Mr Hwang to Seoul directly but if that is not possible we can make other arrangements,"" Chang said. Korean sources have said Hwang may be whisked away to another country, possibly in Southeast Asia.
Analysts say Hwang will likely end up in Seoul but Beijing is anxious to help North Korea save face by being seen to give due consideration to the hermit nation's concerns.
Hwang, chief architect of Pyongyang's ruling ideology of Juche, or self-reliance, is the highest North Korean official to flee the Stalinist state.
His defection has placed extra strains on ties between the two Koreas, arch-enemies since the 1950-53 civil war ended in an uneasy ceasefire.
Armed Chinese police backed by armoured personnel carriers and a crowd control truck maintained a tight security cordon around Seoul's consular compound where Hwang is holed up in Beijing's normally sedate diplomatic quarter.
Beijing has appealed to North and South Korea to stay calm during attempts to end the diplomatic standoff sparked by Hwang's defection.
Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said last week Beijing was still investigating Hwang's case and hoped for a solution as soon as possible.
North Korea initially accused the South of kidnapping Hwang, then changed its hardline stance by saying if he really had defected he was a traitor and would be dismissed.
Beijing, which sent its armies to fight on Pyongyang's side during the Korean War, established diplomatic links with Seoul only in 1992.

2765,"When China's Chairman Mao Zedong died the news paralysed the nation, but 20 years later the passing of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping is mere office chatter in a country radically changed by his policies.
Some Chinese responded on Thursday to Deng's death with sadness and others with cold indifference. There was no great outpouring of grief of the kind that accompanied Mao's death in September, 1976.
When Mao died at age 82, weeping crowds poured out of factories and offices.
""It was like a family had lost its mother or the sky had collapsed,"" said a woman who was at high school then.
""We cried like we lost our father and mother,"" said a driver parked near Deng's residence in central Beijing. ""Now everyone is indifferent.""
Beijing announced six days of mourning for Deng, whose death at 92 on Wednesday closed the book on almost two decades of rule that transformed China into a budding economic powerhouse.
But in streets and offices it was business as usual, with no outward displays of grief. Street markets bustled and factories of the new economic powerhouse that Deng created hummed with activity.
""I am a little sad over Deng, but not shocked. People knew early on that Deng's health was poor,"" said a clerk bustling off to work.
""Deng doesn't measure up to the likes of Mao,"" said a 62-year-old sunflower seed vendor. ""I don't care one bit about Deng's death.""
Residents and political analysts said the greater freedom created by Deng's reformist economic policies changed the way Chinese regarded their leaders.
""This indicates people's attitudes towards the death of leaders has matured -- their minds are free,"" said a Chinese analyst who declined to be identified.

2774,"Chinese police cordoned off a South Korean embassy compound on Thursday and North Korean diplomats lurked outside as an official from Seoul met the most senior North Korean to defect from the Stalinist state.
But Beijing officials, apparently angered by Seoul's decision to export its latest row with Pyongyang into China, avoided meeting Kim Ha-jung, a special adviser to South Korean Foreign Yoo Chong-ha, South Korean sources said.
South Korean embassy officials had earlier said the Seoul Foreign Ministry envoy was meeting Chinese officials to discuss the fate of the defector, Hwang Jang-yop, a senior aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il.
Chinese police blocked streets to Seoul's consular section in the sedate, tree-lined diplomatic district of Beijing, and embassy officials said Hwang and his assistant were inside.
Hwang, 73, is one of the chief architects of North Korean communism, and the highest ranking official from the world's last Stalinist state to seek asylum in the South.
Kim met Hwang in the consular office, South Korean sources said. No other details were available.
China avoided direct comment after finding itself in the eye of a diplomatic storm involving its old communist comrade and a new commercial ally and major source of investment, choosing instead to appeal for calm.
""Regarding the transit through Beijing by Hwang Jang-yop, we were not notified in advance,"" a Foreign Ministry spokesman said, in a signal of China's anger.
""We hope the parties concerned can deal with this matter calmly and on the basis of the overall circumstances, and appropriately handle this to safeguard the peace and stability of the Korean peninsula,"" the spokesman added.
Previous, low-profile defectors from the North have made their way quietly through China, apparently after making contact with the South Korean embassy, but Seoul did not publicise their journey until they were out of China.
Seoul announced Hwang's defection on Wednesday.
South Korean Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha was to meet his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen in Singapore on Friday morning at 9 a.m. (0100 GMT) to discuss the diplomatic crisis.
In a sign of the suspicion that underscores dealings between North and South, South Korean embassy officials accused North Koreans of trying to force their way into the consular office and called for Chinese police protection.
Diplomats from Pyongyang sat in parked cars outside the consular compound and waited outside the embassy, watching from behind police cordons.
""Last night, North Korean people who we believe were from the embassy tried to enter our consular section,"" embassy spokesman Chang Moon Ik told reporters. Chinese police on guard prevented the North Koreans from entering, he said.
""We have asked the Chinese government to protect our embassy compound... against North Koreans and any unexpected (incidents),"" he said.
He dismissed Pyongyang's charges that Hwang, one of 11 secretaries on the powerful secretariat of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party, had been kidnapped by the South, saying Hwang had arrived in a taxi and voluntarily sought asylum.
North Korean diplomats stood by the kidnapping charge.
""I think South Korea has kidnapped these two officials,"" said one of several North Korean officials waiting in the office tower housing Seoul's embassy. ""The impossible has happened.""
""We expect that the Chinese side will take appropriate measures in this regard,"" a North Korean official said.
South and North Korea were separated at the end of World War Two and fought a war from 1950 to 1953. China fought on North Korea's side in the conflict.

2778,"An actor who played Deng Xiaoping in a recent movie release says he wants to avoid being typecast in the golden role now that the Chinese patriarch has exited the earthly stage.
Beijing actor Shi Xin debuted as the late paramount leader in ""Battles for Glory over Taihang Mountains"", an action-packed tale of the diminutive ruler's World War Two exploits which premiered in December.
Since then he has been offered Deng roles in five other films. ""My teachers, classmates and friends all say I'm going to get stuck in this one role,"" Shi, 25, told Reuters.
""I don't think that's right. If the day comes that I can play another role, I will be hardworking and earnest in my acting,"" Shi said.
Deng, one of Chinese communism's greatest revolutionaries as well as its most spectacular reformer, died aged 92 last Wednesday. That was also Shi's 25th birthday.
""At first I really didn't believe it,"" Shi said. ""I feel connected to him in some way.""
Plucked from the Central Drama Institute at age 23 to act the part of Deng, Shi said he found it tough to play the pint-sized patriarch, who despite his larger-than-life status as China's de facto emperor stood just 150 cm (five feet) tall.
""Deng Xiaoping was an incredible, a great man,"" Shi said. ""So when I got this role my heart was very heavy.
""To make the transition to playing such a great man was very difficult and gave me a lot of pressure, because I am so young,"" Shi said.
""My biggest challenge was losing weight,"" the 170-cm (5 ft 8 inch) Shi said. ""For the filming I didn't eat any staple foods. I mostly ate tomatoes and cucumbers.""
To prepare for the most important role of his career, Shi holed up in a classroom where he pored over books and photo albums to glean every detail about Deng's life and times.
""Although everyone felt I did a pretty good job, I still think I lacked a lot,"" he said, but added that the complexity of Deng's peppery persona could entice him into future films.
""Deng Xiaoping is not an average character. Playing him is something I will work on my whole life,"" he said.
Released last December, ""Battles for Glory"" failed even to recoup its shooting costs of just nine million yuan ($1.08 million), one-ninth of which came from central government coffers, said director Qin Yan.
Qin said she hoped Deng's death would rekindle interest in the man who helped lead the Communist Party to victory in 1949 and whose reforms sparked one of the fastest economic booms the world has seen.
Beijing had ordered cinemas across China to interrupt their normal fare of Hong Kong kung fu films and Hollywood blockbusters and instead roll over six films about Deng, including ""Battles for Glory"", Qin said.
""This film now has a mythological aspect to it,"" Qin said. ""We can cherish his memory and remember him through this film.""
Managers at several theatres in the capital were not so sure. They took Deng off their marquees on Saturday in the face of poor customer response to tales of his exploits.
""We sold one ticket,"" one manager said, noting that the same films had been running almost continuously on television since Deng's death was announced.

2782,"Busy Chinese took the death of Deng Xiaoping in their stride on Friday, praising the patriarch for the economic miracles he created but blaming him for social ills such as corruption and unemployment.
The day after the announcement of the passing of the man whose reforms gave Chinese unprecedented freedom, residents in Beijing bustled off to work, street markets buzzed with activity and factories churned out their goods.
""Deng was a great man, people will miss him and appreciate him for greatly improving their living standards in such a short time,"" a retired factory worker said in her home in Beijing.
""It's not something we common people can worry about,"" said a Beijing taxi driver of Deng's passing. ""I still need to make money.""
Deng's 18-year rule, which transformed China from a backward hermit nation into an economic powerhouse, ended on Wednesday night when he died from complications linked to the advanced stages of Parkinson's disease. He was 92.
""Deng was a man who changed China's history and guided China into the world from being an isolated country,"" said a former official in the southern boomtown of Shenzhen who abandoned his government post to go into business.
An editor in a state-run publishing house in Beijing said her company would hold an informal discussion session on Deng's ideology on Friday afternoon.
""Just for half a day we will take a look at his spirit and study the thoughts of Deng Xiaoping,"" the editor said.
However, some Chinese said Deng's achievements in freeing China from the collectivist shackles clamped on it by the late Chairman Mao Zedong would be overshadowed by the social ills unleashed by his policies.
""I don't want to totally reject Deng, but Deng set a bad example for China's rulers in the aspect of corruption,"" said a 30-year-old musician in Beijing.
""Deng's family members all get good treatment in society. There must be great changes in China in the future,"" he said.
Market competition created by Deng's reforms had forced the closure of state-run industries in many regions, swelling the ranks of the jobless.
""Many state firms here have collapsed and their officials have no capacity to manage them,"" said one girl, a high school student in Daixingganling in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang, a stronghold of socialist industry.
""My parents and I just feel some uncertainty, some worry. We feel no confidence,"" she said by telephone.
Another legacy of Deng, the bloody June 4, 1989, crackdown on student-led demonstrations centred on Beijing's Tiananmen Square, would leave a stain on later assessments of the diminutive patriarch.
""They shouldn't have fired their guns on the common people. They should have used peaceful means to solve the situation,"" the publishing editor said.
""History will deliver an accurate judgment,"" she said.
Some doubted that President Jiang Zemin, picked by Deng to assume the mantle of power, had the political mettle to lead China into the 21st century.
""China really needs a powerful leader like Deng to guide it forward,"" said a government clerk in the Tibetan capital Lhasa.
""Although the third generation of leaders is becoming more sophisticated...I'm worried that new leaders may not be so determined in making decisions,"" another businessman in Shenzhen said.

2783,"U.S. and Chinese negotiators were locked in last-ditch talks on Saturday to try to hammer out a new textile accord and a deal on market access after extending by a day a deadline for a cross-Pacific trade war.
Chief U.S. textile negotiator Rita Hayes said she was confident of an agreement on Saturday in a fifth day of talks with officials at China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
""We felt like we had made tremendous progress and we are looking to complete negotiations today,"" she told Reuters before leaving for the ministry. ""You're always positive you can reach an agreement but you have to balance it out.""
Hayes and Chinese officials wrangled late into Friday night to try to iron out problems in renewing a 1994 textile accord and resolve a dispute over U.S. penalties on Chinese exports.
The United States had extended by a day the deadline for agreement on a new textile accord with China, Hayes said.
""I felt like it was important to extend it, the deadline, for one day... so we could get a fresh start this morning,"" Hayes said before resuming the eleventh-hour talks.
""We did not complete the agreement... so we felt like we'd have one extra day to complete it,"" she said. ""We didn't finish last night so we are re-evaluating where we are and will continue negotiations this morning.""
U.S. officials said they hoped for a deal by the end of Saturday.
Washington slapped $19 million worth of penalties on imports of Chinese textiles last September, saying Beijing was shipping textiles through third countries to evade quota restrictions.
China has threatened to retaliate by temporarily banning imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods and alcoholic drinks but has delayed such action to allow time for further talks.
Hayes said the U.S. side was still focusing on two major demands -- its market access package and a level playing field for the textile industry.
""The two main things that we have been consistently concerned about are the market access that China has to the United States... and also making sure that it is balanced, that we have a market access package from China,"" she said.
Disagreement over market access in China appeared to be a major stumbling block, industry representatives said earlier.
However, they said hopes for a deal were high, with Hayes and her team believed to be putting the finishing touches to the text of an agreement.
""I expect the reason for the talks not wrapping up is market access,"" said National Retail Federation vice-president Robert P. Hall said on Friday. ""This is an issue that is not traditionally part of apparel bilaterals.""
Washington could make significant cuts to China's textile quotas if agreement could not be reached before the previous deadline of January 31, Hayes has said.
Washington and Beijing were also seeking to ease tensions in a dispute over Chinese exports of textiles via third countries.

2789,"China on Thursday hinted at ethnic unrest in Moslem Xinjiang as a senior official called for unity in the western region that was rocked by separatist bomb attacks last week.
""Xinjiang ...must further improve ethnic unity, protect social stability and do a better job of building up Xinjiang,"" the official People's Daily quoted Vice-Premier Li Lanqing as saying.
Li made no direct reference to the series of deadly bombings in Xinjiang's capital Urumqi on February 25, the day Beijing held funeral rites for late leader Deng Xiaoping.
The Chinese vice premier's remarks to Xinjiang delegates at the National People's Congress, or parliament, were one of the few signs in the national media that the region had once again been shaken by ethnic unrest.
Chinese police have arrested at least 20 ethnic Uighurs in Urumqi and Yining near Xinjiang's border with Kazakhstan, exiled Uighur nationalists said from the Kazakh capital of Almaty.
""At least 20 ethnic Uighurs have been arrested...but the real number may be even higher because we have no information whether new arrests took place last night,"" Kakharman Khozhamberdi, head of a local Uighur association, told Reuters in Almaty.
Officials and residents in Urumqi and Yining, contacted by telephone from Beijing, were unaware of the total number of people arrested in the attacks.
Three bombs hidden on public buses blew up within minutes of each other in Urumqi on February 25 in an apparently coordinated attack. A fourth bomb failed to explode.
The Xinjiang Daily said on Wednesday that authorities had arrested several people suspected of planting bombs and of selling detonators used in the attacks that killed nine people and wounded 74.
Police were interrogating the suspects and had launched a manhunt for others still at large, the regional newspaper said.
China's official media outside the Moslem region ignored the incident.
Moslem separatists say they want to set up an independent ""East Turkestan"" in Xinjiang, a region that is home to many Turkic-speaking people such as the Uighur ethnic minority.
Exiled Uighur nationalists have claimed responsibility for the latest attacks.
Parliament's vice-chairman Wang Hanbin on Thursday introduced revisions to China's criminal law setting stiffer punishment for stirring up ethnic hatred and making it a capital crime to use race or religion to endanger state security.
""People in some places are stirring up hatred among ethnic groups in an attempt to undermine unity among them,"" Wang told parliament.
In early February, an anti-Chinese riot erupted in Yining, about 50 km (31 miles) from Xinjiang's border with Kazakhstan. Chinese officials said nine people were killed.
The riot was one of the largest, most violent demonstrations for independence in Xinjiang since the 1949 communist takeover.
Beijing, unnerved by the spectre of turmoil along its borders, had put the Lanzhou Military Region, which oversees Xinjiang, on alert against further unrest, Hong Kong's Sing Tao Daily newspaper said on Wednesday.

2791,"Talks in Beijing on the fate of a senior Pyongyang defector have made progress but have not clinched a deal despite a personal bid by North Korea's foreign minister to break the deadlock.
""There has been some headway. Negotiations are still going on,"" Chang Moon-ik, spokesman for the South Korean embassy in Beijing, said on Tuesday about talks on Hwang Jang-yop, who sought refuge in Seoul's Beijing consulate four weeks ago.
Hwang, a senior North Korean ideological theoritician and top aide to supreme leader Kim Jong-il, has been stranded in the consular compound since February 12 while the three nations negotiate his fate.

China said on Tuesday that North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam visited Beijing last Saturday in what analysts said was an apparent bid by Pyongyong to break the three-way deadlock.
Hwang, chief architect of Pyongyang's ruling ideology of Juche, or self-reliance, is the highest North Korean official to flee the Stalinist state.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai played down Kim's visit, saying he was only passing through the Chinese capital on his way to Africa and his trip ""did not touch on any special problem"".
Weeks of talks over Hwang's fate, interrupted by the death of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping last month, have failed to produce an accord as Beijing finds itself torn between an old communist ally and a new capitalist friend.

2799,"Deng Xiaoping was an avid bridge player who relished a croissant and a glass of milk, loved playing at the seaside with his grandchildren and did not balk at sending in the army to crush unarmed, rebellious students.
Chain-smoking until his fingers were stained brown and fond of keeping a spittoon at his feet in meetings with foreign dignitaries, the diminutive ruler possessed a personality as peppery as the cuisine of his native Sichuan province.
""Unsentimental and humorless, he seemed to have few qualms of conscience, and little compunction to ingratiate himself with others through convivial chatter,"" wrote Orville Schell in his book ""Mandate of Heaven"".
He was a ""nasty little man"", former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said of the man who ruled China for the 1980s and much of the 1990s and stood just 1.50 metres (5 ft) in the white socks he preferred.
He failed equally to charm Britain's Margaret Thatcher.
But Deng was a man who didn't seem to care about what people thought -- even when it cost him his political career.
In 1966, as Chairman Mao Zedong was setting in motion a devastating campaign to weed out opposition to his leadership, Deng flaunted expected codes of loyalty by evading mandatory attendance of a series of revolutionary operas.
Finally coerced into making an appearance, he dozed off in mid-performance, unconcerned that he was making a lifelong enemy of Mao's wife, Jiang Qing, who designed the operas and had Deng banished far from Beijing in ensuing political purges.
Unrepentant and unfazed, Deng busied himself with a small garden in central Jiangxi province, growing cabbages, potatoes and garlic to supplement the meagre salary he drew as a worker at a tractor repair factory.
It was in internal exile that Deng grew to love the game of bridge, honing his skill by playing all four positions alone and carefully studying the intricacies of strategy.
It became a lifelong passion -- many of his favoured aides were bridge partners. But he never played for money, requiring only that the loser crawl around on all fours under the table.
Alhough Deng had shed all his official posts by 1990, he still retained one title at the time of his death on Wednesday -- honorary chairman of the China Bridge Players Association. Bridge was, in his words, ""a game for great personalities"".
A youth spent in France in the 1920s instilled in the young revolutionary a lifelong penchant for croissants and milk.
Hoping to acquire some of the pastries on a visit to a United Nations meeting in 1974, Deng took advantage of a stopover in Paris to buy 100 croissants, returning to share them with premier Zhou Enlai and other friends from his Paris days.
He also smoked two packs a day of Panda-brand cigarettes -- a half-filter, half-tobacco cigarette available only to China's top leaders. He gave up the habit in 1989.
He was also not averse to a swig of the fiery white Chinese liquor that is de rigeur for toasting at banquets. Unable to afford spirits when in the political wilderness, he drank beer.
He kept fit with daily walks around his spacious compound down a narrow, leafy alley in central Beijing and swam each summer at the seaside resort of Beidhaihe, where he would take a dip in the ocean for an hour every day, come rain or shine.
Always mindful of puritan communist values of frugality and modesty, Deng never appeared dressed in anything other than an austere Mao suit of blue or grey.
He relaxed on his 1979 tour of the United States when he endeared himself to his hosts by accepting a pair of cowboy boots from singer John Denver, donning a 10-gallon cowboy hat and riding around a Texas rodeo in a stagecoach.
Deng was also an ardent fan of soccer -- China's most popular sport -- and watched 50 of the 52 matches in the 1990 World Cup.
Deng set himself apart from Mao, who was worshipped in a frenzied personality cult, preferring to keep a low, private profile.
He cherished his role as a husband and father, finding time to spend with his five children, bringing his grandchildren along on official tours and playing with them at the beach.
""He is rather philosophical on the question of personal fate... optimistic in the face of adversity,"" Deng's daughter Deng Rong once wrote of her father.

2801,"The unexpected departure of CompuServe Corp's CEO Robert Massey may portend further woes at the second largest online service, and deeper-than-expected financial losses are one possibility, analysts said Tuesday.
On Monday, a holiday in the U.S., CompuServe said that Massey had resigned, effective immediately, and that Massey wants to ""pursue other interests."" The troubled online service is expected to report a loss on Thursday, when it is due to report third quarter earnings.
The First Call consensus is for a loss of $0.16 a share.  
""When a top guy leaves right before earnings, you can expect a disappointment or a restructuring,"" said Abhishek Gami, an analyst with Nesbitt Burns Securities. ""Maybe it will be worse than expected, but I think the expectations are already low."" CompuServe shares were off 7/16 to 10-3/8.
CompuServe has had a rough year, with increasingly intense competition from the leader America Online Inc.
""It is unfortunate timing, in that it was so close to earnings, because that always encourages people to connect the dots,"" said a CompuServe spokesman. ""But in this case, the dots aren't really there. It's all really speculation.""  
CompuServe said that Massey decided to leave for personal reasons, saying it has been a tough year, and that he wants to take a break from the prodigious hours he has been working.
""Clearly there are also pressures for CompuServe to return to profitability, that's no secret,"" the spokesman added. ""But there is no direct cause and effect there.""
The CompuServe spokesman also said that the Columbus, Ohio-based company has in the past issued a warning when its earnings will come in below Wall Street's expectations. It has not issued any such warnings in recent weeks. Earlier this month, Massey said its financial position had improved.  
But Massey declined to say when CompuServe might return to profitability.
Still, analysts said more bad news could come in the form of flat or even slower subscriber growth, at a time when rival AOL's subscriber base continues to soar, or perhaps from a disappointment in its successful network services division.
""He jumped before he got pushed,"" said Gary Arlen, an analyst with Arlen Communications in Bethesda, Md. ""Their membership base is pretty flat. Their growth has been negligible, especially in a world where beleaguered AOL was adding hundreds of thousands of subscribers.""  
Arlen said that CompuServe has gained new members as a direct result of AOL's recent network problems, but that these new members are ""negligible.""
In November, CompuServe exited its Wow! consumer business, a flat-rate, family-oriented service that it had unveiled with much fanfare. CompuServe said that the flat-rate pricing was not profitable and it will continue to focus on the hobbyists, small businesses and corporate users of its online service.
""Now at least they are focused on the business market,"" said Kate Delhagen, a Forrester Research analyst. ""H&amp;R Block seems to think they need an overhaul.""  
H&amp;R Block Inc still owns about 80 percent of CompuServe, since it went public last April at $30 a share.
Frank Salizzoni, president and CEO of H&amp;R Block, will act as an interim CEO of CompuServe, until another executive is found. CompuServe said that it has hired an executive search firm to help it locate external candidates, but it is also looking inside the company.
""We want to proceed at a brisk pace,"" the spokesman said, when asked if CompuServe has a specific deadline to replace Massey. ""It's more important to get the right person than to get someone quickly.""  
Salomon Brothers analyst Marc Usem said in a report to clients that while the short-term effect of Massey's departure is negative, it may work to CompuServe's advantage.
""A more aggressive, marketing oriented CEO may improve the company's online service prospects,"" Usem wrote in a note to clients, where he reiterated a buy rating on CompuServe. He said that CompuServe's Network Services unit alone is worth $8.50 to $10.20 a share.
Analysts said that while CompuServe has been hurt by AOL's success, many of the proprietary online services have closed or have seen problems as the Internet becomes more popular.

2811,"International Business Machines Corp.'s $23 billion Global Services business will become a separate IBM group, the company announced Wednesday, acknowledging the significance of the fast-growing business.
In a related development, IBM Chairman Louis Gerstner reiterated in the company's annual report an earlier statement that it planned to hire ""thousands more"" employees to fuel growth, most of them in Global Services.
IBM told analysts earlier this year it will probably add as many new employees in 1997 as it did in 1996, with a big chunk in Global Services.
In 1996, the Armonk, N.Y.-based computer giant's worldwide head count grew to 241,000, up from 225,000 in 1995, mostly due to the expanding services business, an IBM spokesman said. In 1995, employment grew from 220,000 in 1994, the first time employment grew in 10 years.
""I'd like to add here that I am very happy -- and proud -- that our transformation has created job growth,"" Gerstner said in his letter to shareholders, in which he described 1996 overall as ""a solid year.""
When Gerstner first took over the then-struggling computer giant in April 1993, one of his first actions was to take a whopping restructuring charge and cut 25,000 jobs from IBM.
The Global Services unit -- which designs, installs and services computers, including running entire corporate computer systems -- was formerly part of IBM's Sales and Services group.
Sales and Services will be renamed the Sales and Distribution Group, still headed by IBM Senior Vice President Ned Lautenbach.
IBM also said Dennie Welsh, who was general manager of Global Services, will be promoted to a senior vice president and report directly to Gerstner.
Welsh was also named an IBM group executive and will join IBM's executive committee, which makes strategic decisions.
""The time is right for this change,"" Gerstner said in an IBM memo announcing the reorganization. ""He (Welsh) and his colleagues on the services team have done an outstanding job building a great new business for IBM. This change not only reflects a logical adjustment in our organisational structure, but also a recognition of their success.""
IBM's services business has been its fastest growing in recent quarters. In the fourth quarter, IBM said services revenues jumped 22 percent to $5 billion. In comparison, IBM's total revenues grew 6 percent in the fourth quarter.
""This is a transformation of the IBM company,"" said Sam Albert, a Scarsdale, N.Y.-based consultant. ""The major revenue stream is not coming from hardware, it will come from software and services ..."".
""This has some impact on the way IBM sees its future,"" Albert added. ""Anything this important demands direct oversight by Gerstner.""
Wednesday's move follows changes in December when IBM consolidated computer services under the IBM Global Services brand. IBM's services organisation had been operating in some countries outside the United States under different names.
The addition of Global Services now gives IBM five major corporate divisions. The others are the Software Group, the Server Group, which makes the computers that run networks; the Personal Systems Group; and Sales and Distribution.
With Welsh's promotion to IBM senior vice president, the company now has a total of 10 senior vice presidents.
IBM stock fell $1.50 to $137.857 on the New York Stock Exchange.

2814,"International Business Machines Corp. Tuesday introduced its next generation mainframe computer family, with systems twice as fast as currently available models, in a product launch widely anticipated by its customers.
""The feedback is phenomenal,"" said Ross Mauri, vice president of System 390 hardware developnment, in a phone interview. ""We have seen quite a bit of demand out there.""
""Customers have been enthusiastic about embracing the new server,"" Mauri said, adding that it is likely that IBM will be ""sold out of what we can produce this year,"" based on the initial customer reaction.
Mainframes are giant computers that store the data of the biggest corporations around the world. They are used by banks for transactions, by airlines for reservations systems, and by insurance companies for claims processing.
While many analysts have predicted the demise of these giant computers as more companies move to PC-based networks, mainframes have staged somewhat of a comeback as huge repositories of data that is accessible via the Internet and internal networks known as intranets.
The new mainframe servers use the third generation of IBM's lower-cost processor technology, called CMOS. The CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) technology is a process that uses microprocessor technology that is less costly to build and less expensive for customers to maintain.
IBM introduced two new lines of System 390 servers, or computers that manage networks.
One family, called the IBM S/390 Parallel Entreprise Server, has 13 models designed specifically for heavy data storage and for transaction intensive companies.
The second server line, the IBM S/390 Multiprise 2000, is aimed at medium-sized customers who are currently using IBM S/390 mainframes, but wish to increase their computing power. The Multiprise is also aimed at customers who wish to buy an entire package, with software and storage systems.
So far, IBM has installed about 14 of the S/390 Parallel Enterprise Servers - Generation 3 in an early customer program. IBM has also installed three of the S/390 Multiprise.
IBM also said it introduced an upgrade of its mainframe operating system, called OS/390 Release 2, which provides more connectivity for customers to computer networks such as the Internet and UNIX based systems. IBM also introduced other software products for better network computing over the S/390.
IBM also introduced new mainframe disk storage products for improved data reliabilty.
IBM declined to give any price details on the new models, saying that it tailors each systems to unique customer needs and that customers are now familiar with the lower prices of CMOS-based mainframes.
""As you make the transition from bipolar to CMOS, you see a significant price reduction,"" said Mauri. ""Customers already have an understanding of that.""
Bipolar refers to the process technology that IBM used in its older mainframe models. Three years ago, IBM began preparing its customers for a big transition to a new, lower-cost machine, designed around microprocessors.
Analysts said the new mainframes run at speeds of around 45 million instructions per second (MIPS), twice as fast as the currently available speeds of 22 million instructions per second for the fastest CMOS models, bringing the systems up to the speeds of the older bipolar machines, and at a lower cost.
Even with the prices of these huge milllion dollar systems falling, mainframes are still IBM's biggest revenue producing hardware. Analysts are hoping for a big uptick in fourth quarter earnings, in part due to mainframes, because the lower-cost models are more profitable to IBM.
""These are all necessary announcements for IBM,"" said Gary Helmig, a SoundView Financial Group analyst, adding that the products are important to IBM's future earnings.
IBM said the new models will be available next month.
""The mainframe as we once knew it, where MIPS were expensive, we are never going to see that again,"" said Sam Albert, an industry consultant in Scarsdale, N.Y. ""IBM has re-engineered the mainframe, they don't even want to call it a mainframe anymore, they call it a server.""

2815,"JAMtv, a six-month-old online company started by a Chicago music promoter, hopes to turn the personal computer into a personalized jukebox.
As a first step, the company will unveil on Monday a music network on the Internet using multimedia technology from Intel Corp.
JAMtv plans to broadcast live concerts, link with radio stations for other programming, sell CDs and other merchandise and provide daily news and reviews.
The company is also working with privately held BackWeb, one of the leading ""push"" technology companies, which broadcasts personalized news and information directly to a person's PC.
""The goal is that you will have your own personal jukebox on your computer,"" Howard Tullman, chief executive of JAMtv, said.
JAMtv spun out from Jam Productions Ltd, a well-known concert producer and promoter in Chicago whose co-founder, Jerry Mickelsen, is chairman.
The company hopes its network will become the main source of music on the Internet, featuring contemporary and alternative rock arists and eventually country and jazz.
But JAMtv is not trying to be the MTV of the Internet, Tullman stressed.
He noted that in recent years MTV has had to change its programming to offer more shows and features, like the ""Real World"" soap opera, because MTV viewers tired of someone else making their programming decisions for them.
""It's a network of one,"" Tullman said of the planned JAMtv service.
""Anytime you go there, you can listen to what you want. You don't have to wait for someone to make these programming decisions for you,"" he said. ""We will let you design your profile and what you want.""
He said the JAMtv site on the World Wide Web will have daily events, with a calender of more than 1,500 events already planned for this year based on upcoming Jam Productions events, such as a U2 concert in Soldier Field in Chicago as part of the group's tour.
Users of the JAMtv site can also buy from a catalog of more than 140,000 music CDs, 70,000 music and entertainment videos and access an archive of images, audio, video and other data on hundreds of artists.
Tullman also said JAMtv was talking to computer makers and to Microsoft Corp. and Netscape Commuications Corp. in an effort in get a spot on the Windows desktop and a part of the Netscape browser, so that users will be able to simply click on an icon and have their JAMtv.
JAMtv is also embracing Intel's ""hybrid"" method of sending fat audio and video files over the Internet, by providing users with compact disks of some audio and video, which is then supplemented by updated audio and video streams sent over the Internet.
The company hopes to make money is several ways, by selling merchandise over the Internet, by selling advertising and licensing fees to radio affiliates for programming and through compiling databases on subscribers which it could sell to record companies.
Ultimately, Tullman said, a big JAMtv revenue stream will come from a ""pay-per-view"" distribution of live concerts on the Internet.
""At the end of the day, when you can truly go home at night and click on your PC and watch any concert you want, there will be pay per view revenues in this business,"" Tullman said.

2821,"As the bad news continues to swirl around America Online Inc, some of its competitors are now swooping in, hoping to gain new members from the growing number of disgruntled AOL users who are fed up with its woes.
On Sunday, CompuServe Corp, the second largest online service, plans to run its first-ever Super Bowl ad, a 30-second television spot, called the ""Busy Signal.""
CompuServe said it will not specifically mention AOL, but the ad is clearly a jab at AOL's current woes, since it has been besieged with users since it switched to unlimited use.  
CompuServe also plans a print campaign with the theme of reliability in accessing the Internet without frequent connectivity problems. The company declined to say how much it is spending for the total campaign.
""We are doing the print compaign and the spot simply because our competitors problems have been so widely reported and so widely known, we think the public feels that all online service providers are having the same problems,"" said Gail Walls, an acting vice president at CompuServe. ""We don't have these problems. Our network is our strength.
Two months ago, CompuServe exited the consumer business.  
When asked why CompuServe is advertising during one of the most expensive advertising time slots aimed at consumers, Walls said CompuServe is not changing its strategy.
""We are interested in the serious Internet customer, we are not pursuing the mass consumer,"" she said. ""The point is to raise awareness about our strength...When you need to make a point, it's a great venue.""
CompuServe's move comes on the heels of comments made by the head of AT&amp;T Corp's WorldNet Internet access service. Late Wednesday, Tom Evslin told Reuters that AT&amp;T is gaining new subscribers who are dissatisfied AOL members.  
He also said that AT&amp;T WorldNet plans a new advertising campaign, one that will focus more on the reliability of its network, in print, television, radio and on the Internet. AT&amp;T does not plan any advertising during the Super Bowl, however.
""This is predatory marketing. They are in a very competitive marketplace,"" said Kate Delhagen, a Forrester Resarch analyst. ""It's not surprising that (many of) the ISPs (Internet service providers) are going right for the jugular. They see consumers who are frustrated and they are capitalizing on this opportunity."" AOL is the world's largest online service with over eight million members.  
AT&amp;T said it will not refer directly to AOL in its new advertising, which will begin sometime in February.
""Rather than targeting AOL users, I think we will make a point about our reliability and let people make their own conclusions,"" Evslin said.
But Microsoft Corp, usually known for its hardball marketing tactics, is taking a kinder, gentler approach to AOL's problems, knowing full well that AOL is not alone in the industry with outages or capacity problems. Just Monday, AT&amp;T said it had a 19-hour outage at WorldNet's managed Internet service, its service for corporate users.  
""We don't think it's a healthy thing for the industry to do anything other than actions which try to expand the market,"" said Jeff Sanderson, general manager of marketing for the Microsoft Network, which is now the third-largest online service with over two million subscribers.
""The message is you should get on the Internet, and MSN is the easiest way to the coolest stuff that is there, including AOL,"" Sanderson said. He said that Microsoft is doing significant marketing for MSN in general, but added that when the software giant mails out the CDs for its service, it tries to target the cities where it has the most capacity available.
""Meeting the unprecedented demand will be a continuing problem for the industry as a whole,"" said Adam Schoenfeld, a Jupiter Communications analyst. ""The twist here is that Internet access in this very competitive market will not be profitable for everyone.""

2824,"The deal that started out as a shocking hostile takeover by the lumbering giant International Business Machines Corp of Lotus Development Corp almost 18 months ago has turned into a happy marriage, Lotus's top executive said.
""It really has been a marriage made in heaven,"" said Jeff Papows, president of Lotus, in an interview at Lotusphere, a conference for its business partners and developers.  ""I think we spent the first year manically fixating on our own foxholes...Now there is enough trust established.""  
Papows said that IBM kept its promise to leave Lotus alone and that IBM tried hard to make the deal work.  The two companies gradually began to trust each other and the synergies between them have emerged slowly but surely.
After an initial flurry of employee exits when Lotus reluctantly agreed to be acquired by IBM for $3.5 billion in June 1995, staff defections eventually stabilized to a normal industry attrition rate.  Lotus's worst fear -- that most of its intellectual capital, its employees, would quit -- was not realized.  
""There are more disastrous mergers in this business,"" Papows said. ""I don't think anyone would have predicted this would go as well as it has.""
The Technology sector has been fraught with mergers gone awry, such as AT&amp;T Corp's purchase of NCR Corp, which it just spun out again as a separate unit.  And IBM had its own unsuccessful deal, when it purchased Rolm Corp in the 1980s.
IBM chairman and CEO Louis Gerstner echoed Papows's view.  
In a brief speech at Lotusphere, Gerstner also said the merger was now working, with ""irrefutable"" evidence, such as the doubling of the number of seats of Lotus Notes sold in 1996, when the number of users reached 9.5 million.
Papows said that besides IBM's big financial pockets and its vast research laboratories, the computer giant also has an incredible global reach through its world-class sales force.
And Gerstner, Papows said, has become ""my single best sales person.""  
Papows said Gerstner recently picked up the phone to speak to the CEO of Rockwell International Corp, and after he explained how important Notes was to IBM's strategy, Rockwelll made a big investment in Notes for its corporate network.
The combination of IBM's clout and reach and Lotus's technology will help it maintain leadership in groupware, as the turf is under siege by Netscape Communications Corp and Microsoft Corp, Papows said.  
Another plus to having IBM as an owner is that the companies can work together to link corporate networks running Lotus Notes to the vast arrays of information stored in IBM mainframes and minicomputers around the world.
""There is a tremendous opportunity to unlock this data,"" Papows said.  ""Netscape doesn't understand this.""  On Wednesday, IBM and Lotus will unveil versions of the Notes Domino server for the IBM AS/400 minicomputer and the S/390 mainframe lines as part of this strategy.
Domino, Lotus's Notes server designed using Internet standards, has become Lotus's crown jewel.  
Users applauded Lotus' move to embrace the open architecture of the Internet, after many skeptics said after IBM bought Lotus that Notes was dead because of the industry's jump to the Web.
""We all heard the refrain, 'Notes is dead,'"" Papows told the conference, adding that it was nothing less than masterful what Lotus has done with Notes and with Sun Microsystems Inc's Java programming language, which is used to develop applications for the Internet that will run anywhere.  
Lotus will introduce a new client version of Notes, Version 4.6 (code-named Lookout) in the first half of this year with a simplified user interface and seamless integration of Microsoft's Internet Explorer and other Web products.
The code name Lookout is a jab at Microsoft, which just introduced a feature called ""Outlook"" in its Office 97 suite. Another upgrade will come in the fourth quarter with Version 5.0, code-named Maui.  Maui will feature even more support of Internet protocols.
Lotus is also working on a set of so-called ""applets"" developed in Java, including a spreadsheet, a calendar, text editor and other pieces, to run on the stripped-down networked computers.  These applications are much less code intensive, with much of the software residing on the severs that run networks.

2828,"The stock of International Business Machines Corp fell in heavy trading on Thursday, hit by renewed fears about its first-quarter earnings after a published report focused on recent analysts' estimate cuts.
The sell-off fueled the overall stock market's fourth sharp sell-off in five days as investors were already scared that Friday's March employment report, if robust, could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again soon.
IBM fell as low as $128.875 before ending down $2.375 at $131.375 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was the third most-active issue on volume of 4.6 million shares.
IBM shares began their tumble in London, where investors first read a Wall Street Journal article that said analysts may not be through cutting IBM's earnings estimates.
The report talked about a recent spate of analysts' estimate cuts, citing fears that a stronger dollar and a mainframe product transition will hurt IBM's first-quarter earnings, due April 23, and depress the stock even further. A strong dollar makes sales overseas worth less in dollar terms.
As previously reported, two weeks ago three Wall Street firms made negative comments and two lowered their estimates on IBM, fueling a drop in IBM's shares in late March.
The report, which appeared as a ""Heard on the Street"" column in Thursday's Journal, also dredged up an almost two-week old rumor that IBM was going to pre-announce that its earnings would come in below analysts' estimates.
""The Wall Street Journal article today is a summation of old news,"" said John Jones of Salomon Brothers. ""We talked to IBM today and they have no plans for a pre-announcement.""
One trader said of the newspaper article: ""They are a bit late to the party here.""
""I heard the rumor but I wouldn't put any credence to it,"" said another trader.
An IBM spokesman declined to comment on the quarter.
As previously reported, on March 21, Morgan Stanley analyst Steve Milunovich cut IBM's 1997 earnings estimate to $12.30 a share from $12.50. For all of 1996, IBM earned $5.4 billion, or $10.24 a share.
On March 20, Dean Witter Reynolds analyst Jay Stevens lowered his first-half earnings estimates for IBM, saying customers might hold off purchases of mainframes until an anticipated upgrade. Some analysts are expecting initial shipments in June.
Stevens added to his estimates for the second half of the year, however, saying the year would be more back-end loaded, as customers make purchases in the second half of the year.
Also in March, Merrill Lynch analyst Daniel Mandresh said it would be tough for IBM's first-quarter earnings, which it estimated at $2.32 a share, to compare to the year-ago period's. The analysts' consensus estimate is $2.31 a share for the first quarter, according to First Call, which tracks estimates.
For the first quarter of 1996, IBM posted earnings of $1.4 billion, or $2.48 a share, excluding charges associated with software acquisitions and other special items.
Gary Helmig, a SoundView Financial analyst, said he is maintaining his first-quarter earnings estimate of $2.32 a share, which he has had since February.
""It's going to be tough to make that number and I doubt that they can overachieve it,"" Helmig said. But he added that foreign currency exchange rates have not changed drastically since February, so he sees nothing new to affect his estimates.
The IBM drop caused the Dow Jones industrial average to lose 39.66 points to end at 6,477.35 after an initial plunge of more than 80 points.

2832,"CompuServe Corp is in talks to be acquired by America Online Inc, a move that would bring new members to AOL, beef up its network and expand its corporate and international presence, industry sources said on Wednesday.
Earlier, CompuServe and H&amp;R Block Inc confirmed market rumors that they were in discussions for a possible ""business combination"" involving CompuServe. Neither CompuServe nor H&amp;R Block, which owns about 80 percent of the computer online service, would provide further details.  
Industry sources said AOL was involved in talks to buy its beleaguered competitor, possibly in an all-stock transaction.
""It's part of the consolidation mechanism that is taking place in the marketplace,"" said Frank Dzubeck, president of Communications Network Architects in Washington. ""They have had conversations off and on....Probably this conversation has gotten reasonably heavy since AOL got into problems having to spend all sorts of money on its network.""  
An H&amp;R Block spokeswomen said she could not elaborate on a statement that confirmed Block and CompuServe were engaged in external discussions regarding a possible business transaction with CompuServe.
AOL declined to comment on the market rumors of talks with CompuServe.  
While AOL shares jumped on Tuesday as rumors circulated in the market, the stock retreated 1-1/8 on Wednesday to 44-5/8, as some analysts said such a deal would prove distracting and costly for AOL, given its current problems achieving profitability.
""There is not a lot of value to the CompuServe subscriber base,"" said Jamie Kiggen, a Cowen &amp; Co analyst.
""There is no guarantee they would stay with AOL. It would be a very dilutive and distracting acquisition for AOL,"" he said. ""AOL is just about to turn profitable here, and we don't need them to buy a money-losing company.""  
""There is no good reason for AOL to buy CompuServe,"" said Abhishek Gami, a Nesbitt Burns Securities analyst. ""If AOL does buy them, it would be a major negative for AOL.""
He said a merger would raise the eyebrows of antitrust regulators at the U.S. Justice Department because it would result in a big gain in AOL's share of the U.S. online services market.
AOL, the No.1 online service, currently has eight million members. CompuServe is second with 3.1 million in the United States and Europe and 2.2 million licensed members in Japan, where it receives royalty payments.  
However, AOL and CompuServe both provide Internet access, and that market has many more players than the proprietary online service business, where there are only four main providers.
Analysts said AOL would have to pay for any deal with stock because of its cash position is low. Its cash and equivalents were listed at $130 million at the end of 1996. Using AOL's stock to pay for the 92.6 million CompuServe shares outstanding (of which H&amp;R Block owns about 74 million) would dilute AOL's shares.
Despite the negative reactions, some analysts said a CompuServe merger could be appealing to AOL.  
Integration of the contrasting images of AOL and CompuServe could also present a big problem. AOL is mainly seen as a consumer online service, while CompuServe is more oriented to business customers and users with more technical sophistication.
Indeed, some analysts said it would be difficult to convert die-hard CompuServe users to AOL.
""Domestically, being a CompuServe user is almost a positive statement that one is not an AOL user,"" said Adam Schoenfeld, a Jupiter Communications analyst. ""AOL has probably already poached every CompuServe user possible.""     Some analysts said
that CompuServe might be a better match for one of the regional Bell operating companies, some of whom are still seeking to enter the Internet access business.
""It has a national network and a well-known brand name that could be reinvigorated,"" said Peter Krasilovsky, an analyst with Arlen Communications Inc in Bethesda, Maryland. ""You don't want to count out the telcos.""

2836,"Wall Street's year-old love affair with IBM showed signs of fraying Wednesday after investors felt jilted by the computer maker's fourth-quarter earnings report.
International Business Machines Corp. stock tumbled $13 in early trading and closed $10 lower at $158 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was the most active issue with more than 12.2 million shares changing hands.
The drop contributed accounted for most of the decline of nearly 34 points in the Dow Jones industrial average, which includes IBM in its 30 stocks. It had some market pundits wondering if the issues affecting IBM's profits in the quarter point to a broader slowdown in corporate earnings this year that could mean an end to the stock market's stellar rally.
The world's largest computer maker late on Tuesday said fourth quarter earnings rose 18 percent to $2 billion, or $3.93 a share, beating the average Wall Street estimate of $3.88 a share but falling short of more optimistic forecasts.
In fact, several analysts said they were disappointed with the results, which were boosted by a lower tax rate and lower-than-expected restructuring costs, but hurt by sluggish mainframe sales and currency fluctuations.
""This quarter took the wind out of their sails,"" said Daniel Ries, a Nomura Research analyst.
""Rather than easily achieve (Wall) Street estimates, IBM appeared to be huffing and puffing,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Steve Milunovich said in a note to clients.
IBM stock more than doubled in the last year, aided late in the year by Merrill Lynch analyst Daniel Mandresh, who in November raised his price target for IBM stock to $195.
On Wednesday Mandresh cut his 1997 earnings estimate for IBM to $13 a share from $13.40, traders said. Mandresh did not return calls seeking comment. But traders said he reiterated his buy rating on the stock and the $195 price target.
For all of 1996, IBM earned $5.4 billion, or $10.24 a share.
While IBM's service business continued to perform well in the fourth quarter -- revenues there grew 22 percent -- mainframe sales were disappointing and its microelectronics unit was hurt by a drop in computer memory chip prices.
In addition, sales of RS/6000 workstations were flat.
""It was disappointing in a number of dimensions, partly hardware growth and the gross margin being low,"" said Painewebber analyst Stephen Smith, who reiterated what he called a controversial ""unattractive"" rating on IBM.
Smith said he expected less profits from mainframes, IBM's traditional stronghold, in 1997 than in 1996.
John Jones of Salomon Brothers said mainframe sales fell 12 percent in the quarter, with 10 percent of those revenues coming from IBM's older less profitable machines that are being discontinued.
Not every analyst saw the earnings report as negative.
""Hardware is the thing that was off the mark,"" said SoundView Financial analyst Gary Helmig, who cited ""some good news underneath"" and reiterated a buy rating on IBM.
Bear Stearns analyst Andrew Neff said he held his attractive rating on IBM shares and kept his 1997 estimate of $12.75 a share unchanged.
Some market analysts said the issues surrounding IBM could foreshadow problems for corporate earnings, and stock prices, down the road.
One issue is the strength of the dollar, which IBM said ate into fourth quarter revenue growth by 3 percentage points.
""The strong dollar is something I think is going to impact earnings for many multinationals,"" said Edgar Peters, chief investment strategist at PanAgora Asset Management. ""That's something that hasn't been talked about much before today.""
The strong dollar can hurt U.S. companies in two ways: profits from overseas are worth less when translated into dollars and companies have a harder time raising prices since foreign competitors have the advantage of a weaker currency.
""It means the pricing power of domestic corporations is hurt,"" said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. ""This foreshadows the real problem of 1997 because one of the pillars of this market has been earnings growth.""
The dollar, recently at its highest level in years against the German mark and Japanese yen, shows few signs of retreating.
Still, some said Wednesday's IBM sell-off was overdone.
""I think there was a lot of retail panic selling,"" Soundview's Helmig said, referring to sales by customers of retail brokerages as opposed to institutional investors.
David Takata of Gruntal &amp; Co. raised his price target on IBM to $200. ""1997 looks like IBM's year of execution,"" he said.

2842,"International Business Machines Corp. Tuesday reported higher fourth quarter profits, bolstered by its strong services and software sales, but some analysts were disappointed about sluggish mainframe sales and lower-than-expected restructuring costs.
The world's largest computer maker said net income rose about 18 percent to $2.02 billion in the quarter from $1.71 billion in the 1995 quarter. Revenues were up 6 percent, to $23.1 billion, from $21.9 billion a year ago.
Earnings per share rose to $3.93 from $3.09, since IBM had 7 percent fewer shares outstanding in the quarter due to stock buybacks. Wall Street analysts had expected profits of $3.88 a share on average, according to First Call, which tracks earnings estimates.
""They were mixed results, software and services were great,"" said David Takata, a Gruntal &amp; Co. analyst.
He said weak mainframe computer revenues were disappointing. Some analysts had been predicting better mainframe revenues in the quarter due to strong new products.
The sluggish mainframe sales and lower-than-expected restructuring costs, however, lead some analysts to call the quarter a disappointment after attending a meeting of IBM executives and analysts in New York.
""It was disappointing, but not disastrous,"" said Barry Bosak, a Smith Barney analyst. ""They are facing challenges, (but) it is not pulling the company down like it was in the late 1980s and early 1990s. We'd like to see more growth and we are not getting it.""
""The quarter looked a little light,"" said Daniel Ries, a Nomura Securities analyst. ""They took a smaller than expected charge... and the tax rate was lower than what everyone was using. I think they missed the number slightly.
For the quarter, IBM's restructuring costs were $200 million, less than previous estimates of between $300-$400 million. IBM said restructuring costs in 1997 would reach about the same level as total costs of $720 million in 1996.
G. Richard Thoman, IBM's chief financial officer, told analysts IBM spent less than planned on restructuring mostly because of its European operations. ""In Europe once again, we were unable to achieve success in voluntary (staff) reductions,"" he said referring to IBM's employee buyout plans.
The Armonk, N.Y.-based computer maker said service revenues jumped 22 percent in the quarter and personal computer sales rose, but sales of mainframes fell and RS/6000 workstations were flat.
Software revenues rose 4 percent in the quarter, and hardware sales increased 2 percent. IBM said its sales of Lotus Notes reached a record of 1.5 million licenses in the quarter, bring the total of Notes licenses to 9 million.
Personal computers were also a bright spot for IBM, but they carry lower product margins.
Thoman said IBM's PC business showed continued improvements, with its profit margin closing in on Compaq Computer Corp.'s margins, which are about 23 percent of revenues, the best in the industry. But he declined to give provide specifics about unit shipments or gross margins.
IBM's total gross profit margins fell in the quarter to 40.3 percent of revenues vs. 41.7 percent a year ago.
""We showed good growth in the fourth quarter despite a difficult year-over-year comparison, continued weakness in Europe and a greater-than-expected currency impact,"" IBM Chairman Louis Gerstner said in a statement.
""Although we still face many challenges, IBM is a much different company than it was only a few years ago,"" he said, noting IBM's services business accounted for 21 percent of revenues at the end of 1996 compared to 13 percent in 1993.
The impact of converting revenues received in foreign currencies into dollars erased 3 percentage points from the fourth-quarter revenue gain, IBM said. That compared with about a two point positive impact in the 1995 quarter.
Net earnings for the year rose to $5.4 billion, or $10.24 a share, from $4.2 billion, or $7.23 a share, in 1995. The 1996 results included a charge for research and development from the acquisition of Lotus Development Corp.
Full-year revenues rose 5.6 percent to $75.95 billion from $71.94 billion.
In a break with tradition, IBM released its results after the stock market closed rather than before the market opened.
The stock closed up $1 at $168 in consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
By region, revenues in North America rose 11 percent to $9.6 billion in the fourth quarter, Asia-Pacific rose 6 percent to $4.3 billion and Latin America gained 4.0 percent to $1.1 billion. Revenues in Europe, Middle East and Africa were $8.1 billion, little changed year over year.

2858,"John Major's Conservatives can no longer rely on the loyal support of much of Britain's press to help deliver the votes needed to secure a fifth successive election victory, editors and political analysts say.
""It's the Sun wot won it,"" Rupert Murdoch's top-selling tabloid trumpeted after Major's ruling party defied the opinion polls and secured a slim 21-seat majority in 1992.
Traditionally pro-Conservative newspapers, some 70 percent of Britain's press, threw their full weight behind Major five years ago, rubbishing opposition leader Neil Kinnock at every turn and warning voters not to trust Labour's promises.
""If Kinnock wins today will the last person to leave Britain please turn out the lights,"" was the Sun's election day message, illustrated with a front-page picture of the Labour leader's head framed in a lightbulb.
But media watchers believe that Major is unlikely to enjoy such unequivocal support against Labour's Tony Blair in an election which the prime minister announced on Monday would be held on May 1. Labour has a big lead in opinion polls.
""It won't be possible for the Sun to be as enthusiastic about Major and negative about Blair as they were about Major and Kinnock last time around,"" said Ian Hargreaves, former editor of the Independent newspaper.
""They have poured so much crap on Major's head that it wouldn't be possible to back him enthusiastically and retain credibility with their readers,"" added Hargreaves, who now edits the left-leaning New Statesman magazine.
Kinnock was portrayed as volatile and untrustworthy by much of the press in the last campaign. Blair is a media-savvy moderate who has taken his party to the centre ground since becoming leader in July 1994 and is a harder target to attack.
Major's battle to keep his party together over future relations with the European Union has reduced his standing among the pro-Conservative newspapers, many of which demandi a stronger anti-European line.
""It would be inconceivable and a mistake for the Sun not to deliver its vote but it might not be done with the rasping clarity we have come to know and love,"" Hargreaves added.
""I would expect the Sun to be pro-Tory but I think the tone may be that of a 'plague on both your houses'. I think that might be something you see in quite a bit of the press.""
POLITICAL BIAS
British newspapers wear their political sympathies on their sleeves, not only writing trenchant editorials but also slanting their news coverage in a way that amazes many foreign readers.
The support is important as newspaper circulation remains high in Britain. The combined circulation of the national dailies has been in gradual decline but still tops 14 million each day.
Among the mass-market tabloids, the Daily Mirror and its Scottish sister the Daily Record were alone in backing Labour in 1992. The Daily Mail and the Daily Express both stuck to their customary pro-Conservative line, as of course did the Sun.
Among the broadsheet ""quality"" press, Murdoch's Times and Canadian Conrad Black's Daily Telegraph both backed the government while the Guardian supported Labour and the Independent lived up to its name by remaining broadly neutral.
Most surprising of all was an election day editorial in favour of Labour from the Financial Times, the daily staple of business people.
Blair understands the power of the press and provoked controversy in 1995 when he accepted an invitation to address a conference organised by Murdoch's News Corp in Australia, the media magnate's homeland.
The Labour leader has dined with several newspaper proprietors and editors who have reacted with warm words to Blair. But Blair's press secretary Alastair Campbell still believes he is ""dealing with a press that basically wants to do us in if it can"".
MURDOCH'S INFLUENCE
Murdoch's influence over the British press is hard to overstate, his News International arm controlling around 35 percent of the market through its ownership of the Sun, the Times and Sunday titles News of the World and Sunday Times.
""Labour are haunted by the Sun 'light-bulb' front page and are determined to avoid a repetition of that,"" said Andrew Jaspan, former editor of Britain's Observer newspaper, commenting on Blair's efforts to build bridges with Murdoch.
There has been speculation that some of the News International stable may come out and back Blair.
Campbell says the Sun and the Daily Mail, often called the voice of Middle England, are the most important papers for his party but he is cautious about the chances of their endorsement. ""I don't think even the most zealous right-wingers in those papers want to get back to where they were with Neil Kinnock,"" he said.
""Having said that, I've always said that if we could actually win the endorsement of a paper whose endorsement we didn't have at the last election, that would be a huge bonus."" The mid-market Express, known as a ""Conservative party cheer leader"", is one possibility. United News &amp; Media, the paper's parent company, is now controlled by Labour supporting peer Lord Hollick, nicknamed ""The Red Baron"".
ABILITY OF MEDIA TO SWING VOTES IN DOUBT
Despite the anecdotal evidence and the Sun's claims, there is some doubt about the extent to which newspapers are able to affect voting patterns although opinion polls show readers of the Telegraph, Times and Sun are increasingly turning to Labour.
""It does look as if the tabloids are able to swing people and the Sun seems better at doing this than the Mirror,"" said Bill Miller, politics professor at Glasgow University.
""Mirror readers are more likely to be politically committed whereas the majority of Sun readers are not political animals and more open to influence,"" he said.
But Miller, who has studied the effects of newspapers on voting, said the importance of the press can be overstated.
He notes that the Sun, for example, sells only four million copies in a nation of 35 million voters.
""There is a net influence -- perhaps a swing of one percent which last time would have made the difference between Major's majority and a hung parliament.""
But he said that this was not enough to affect the 15 to 20 percentage point lead which Labour holds in most opinion polls.
""If you want to annoy an incoming government you must expect to bear the consequences. It may be that the classic Tory tabloids realise this is not the election for them,"" he said.

2860,"British media and leisure company Granada Group Plc said on Friday it planned to close around 100 of its 560 high street rental and retail stores.
""Today we told staff that we are reviewing the position of stores with a view to closing about 100 of the least profitable and least successful,"" a company spokeswoman said.
Granada employs some 1,500 full-time staff and 430 part-timers in its stores across Britain. It would not be drawn on how many would lose their jobs.
""At this stage locations have not been identified,"" the spokeswoman added. The closures are scheduled to begin in May after a three-month consultation period with workers.
The announcement came on the day that Granada announced it had joined forces with fellow British television groups BSkyB and Carlton to bid for digital terrestrial television licences.
Granada has expanded into one of Britain's leading companies in recent years. Last January it acquired the Forte catering and hotel empire in a 3.9 billion pounds ($6.25 billion) takeover.
However, the importance of its rental division has been diminishing in comparison with the rest of the group.
The shops sell household electrical goods and also support the company's television and video rental operations.
Granada has been reducing the number of its stores in recent years to end high street duplication. Growing numbers of customers have been switching to a direct rental operation where they do all their business by telephone.
Granada said in its 1996 annual report that rationalisation of its shop network was ""nearing completion"" after recent cuts.
The company is expected to move to bigger stores in some towns and is likely to keep around 450 shops. It believes that the stores will eventually focus purely on retail activity.

2863,"Investors in Britain's growing band of listed soccer clubs have recently experienced that sinking feeling all too familiar to long-suffering fans.
Shares prices have fallen faster than a relegation-bound team as the euphoria surrounding potential earnings from sources like pay-per-view television gives way to more sober analysis.
The sector has lost around 30 percent in the last six weeks or so, smaller clubs such as premier league strugglers Southampton and first division Sheffield United among the biggest losers.
However, even English champions Manchester United have seen their share price fall from a January high of 737p to its current level of 630p, this despite continuing success on the pitch at home and in Europe.
Share analysts who follow the financial fortunes of the clubs point out that these falls must be seen in the context of spectacular rises of 200 percent and more since early 1996.
Their view is that investors are backing a winner if they stick with the big clubs but that people should think twice before putting money into clubs outside of soccer's elite.
""We believe a derating of the smaller clubs is inevitable and could be marked. These are the footballing bubbles that will fade and die,"" UBS analysts Guy Feld and Julian Easthope wrote in a recent report on what they call ""UK Football Plc"".
""In England, Premier League status will be essential, and the cost of being outside it will increase, because of the increasing concentration of TV revenues at the top end of the game,"" they added.
Pay-per-view television is seen as a major benefit to only the creme de la creme of the British and European game.
UBS selected a top 10 UK soccer franchises, featuring listed clubs Manchester United, Leeds United, Glasgow Celtic and Tottenham Hotspur.
Two more of their tips, English premier league clubs Newcastle United and Aston Villa, will join the market shortly.
Analysts expect heavy interest in both those clubs, given their strong fan base and established position among the most successful teams in the country.
Analyst Nick Batram of Greig Middleton agrees that share prices of some of the smaller clubs could fall further.
But he believes that clubs can make money outside the premier league, providing they do not overstretch themselves.
""They have to look at being profitable in the lower divisions rather than gambling on getting in the Premier League,"" he said.
""Millwall is unfortunately a good example of what happens when you speculate on promotion,"" he said.
Second division Millwall were forced to call in the administrator in January after running up debts of 10 million pounds ($16 million).
The south London club had signed players on lucrative contracts in a bid to join the 20-club premier league elite but ran into financial problems when the club went down rather than up at the end of last season.

2868,"The plight of English soccer team Millwall provides a cautionary tale for investors planning to buy into the growing number of clubs joining the stock market, share analysts said on Wednesday.
Millwall's financial crisis was likely to make potential investors more careful about which stocks they pick in what is a much-hyped and increasingly crowded sector, analysts said.
Millwall Holdings Plc, owners of the London second division club, have called in administrators to run the company while it seeks to put together a financial rescue package.
Shares in Millwall remain suspended on the London Stock Exchange. They were worth just 4p each before their suspension on Tuesday, having slipped away from a price of 20p when they were issued seven years ago.
""This is a warning shot across the bows. Just because it is a soccer stock does not mean that it will outperform the market,"" said Vinay Bedi of stockbrokers Wise Speke.
Shares in premier league clubs Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur and Caspian, owners of Leeds United, have almost trebled over the past year.
Revenue from a television deal with satellite broadcaster BSkyB and the anticipated riches from the introduction of pay-per-view in the coming years have driven growth.
An increasing number of clubs have come to the market to raise new funds and widen ownership.
Premier league glamour club Newcastle United were the latest to join the trend, announcing last week that they aimed to raise up to 50 million pounds ($83 million) through flotation.
But smaller clubs such as West Bromwich Albion have recently joined the junior AIM (Alternative Investment Market) market and their first division rivals Birmingham City and Charlton Athletic are also planning to float.
Analysts point out that there is clearly a greater risk in investing in clubs outside the premier league.
""It is not uncommon for clubs to run into financial problems but Millwall are the first time it has happened to a quoted company,"" said Nick Batram, of brokers Greig, Middleton.
""Fans will buy stocks in their favourite clubs because they want to become more involved. But institutional investors must look beyond the name and at the commercial strategy,"" he said.
""Millwall show that you can't run a lower division club on a premier division cost base,"" he said, noting that Millwall's wage bill of four million pounds last year was as high as that of premier league Southampton.
Millwall made a pre-tax loss of 2.9 million pounds in the year to end-May 1996 as the club tumbled to relegation after a disastrous run of form in the second half of the season.
The success of the premier league over the last five years has widened the gulf between the 20-club elite and the 72 members of the three lower divisions.
A study of the 1994/95 season by accountants Deloitte &amp; Touche showed that the premier league generated almost 70 percent of soccer's total income of 468 million.
But Batram said that lower division clubs, which have their own separate BSkyB deal, could still prove good bets.
""You can be a profitable and successful club in the lower divisions if you have the right cost base,"" he said.
""The key is for clubs to build their business slowly. But it's hard to do that as all fans want their team to be in the premier league."" ($1=.6021 Pound)

2869,"Britain's Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television Holdings Plc, a likely bid target for rival broadcasters, said on Tuesday it believed any offer would have to be at a hefty premium to its current share price.
YTT chairman and chief executive Ward Thomas told a news conference that he believed a bid from northern neighbour Granada Group Plc was ""extremely likely"".
Granada has built up a stake of 27 percent in YTT, the ITV commercial television broadcaster to northern cities such as Leeds and Newcastle, and has long been expected to mount a bid.
That speculation has pushed YTT shares up by some 80 percent over the past 14 months to their current level of around 12.50 pounds ($20.07), giving the company a value of around 800 million pounds, including warrants.
But Thomas suggested any realistic bid would have to be pitched at around 17 pounds per share.
""I say 17 pounds to Gerry (Granada chairman Gerry Robinson),"" Thomas told Reuters in a telephone interview.
""It's a conversational gambit,"" he added.
United News &amp; Media Plc, which already operates ITV franchises for southern and eastern England, is another potential predator, with a stake of some 14 percent in YTT.
Thomas was speaking after YTT announced a 40 percent rise in 1996 pre-tax profit to 30.2 million pounds. It paid a total dividend for the year of 18 pence per share, against 14 in 1995.
YTT shares were down 7-1/2 pence at 12.40 pounds at 1430 GMT.
Thomas said that YTT's profitability could be greatly enhanced if it succeeded in its campaign to have its annual licence fee reduced from an annual 66 million pounds and improved its share of ITV advertising income.
YTT is urging a return to a special duty on advertising, which was originally introduced in 1961 but later scrapped.
Thomas argued that the duty should be applied to all broadcasters including pay television operator BSkyB and the Channel Four commercial station, both currently outside the licence fee system.
Thomas called YTT's 1996 share of ITV advertising revenue disappointing after it fell to 10.3 percent of ITV income.
It is in talks with Laser, its advertising sales agency, to market the whole of northern England as a single region. The fact that Laser is owned by Granada, the ITV broadcaster in north-west England, could facilitate this move. ($1=.6228 Pound)

2872,"Shares in Newcastle United Plc scored a premium to their flotation price on Wednesday when the Premier League soccer club became the latest team to join the London Stock Exchange.
Newcastle, floated at 135p, had added 6p to 141p by 1145GMT in heavy trading.
The club, based in northeast England and home to stars such as England captain Alan Shearer, Frenchman David Ginola and Colombian Faustino Asprilla, has a market capitalisation of just over 200 million pounds ($330 million).
Soccer club stocks rocketed in value last year but there has been a sharp correction in recent weeks, with the lesser lights of the Premier League and First Division clubs hit hardest.
Euphoria over potential income from pay-per-view television has evaporated, and the increasing supply of soccer club stocks has allowed investors to pick and choose more carefully.
However, clubs are still queueing up to join the market. Bolton Wanderers, poised for promotion to the Premier League, will be floated later this month following a 22 million pound agreed takeover by a company called Mosaic Investments.
Mosaic, which manufactures bar and catering products, is to rename the enlarged group Burnden Leisure Plc and plans to develop it into a sports and leisure business. The name is taken from Bolton's Burnden Park stadium.
Share analysts had expected the Newcastle flotation to prove popular as it gives investors access to one of the glamour clubs of the English game.
Only season ticket holders and club employees were allocated shares after the 15 percent retail tranche in the offer was heavily oversubscribed. The remainder was taken up by institutional investors.
Share analysts believe that Newcastle is well placed to benefit from soccer's financial growth. But they note that it still has work to do before it can claim to be on a par with the elite trio of Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal. Of those three, only United are listed on the main market.
""Newcastle have great ingredients with strong local support, a developing brand and a reputation for the kind of exciting soccer which attracts television audiences,"" said analyst Nick Batram of Greig, Middleton.
""The next stage is to turn that into profits and for a lot of people the jury is still out -- they want to see the company deliver.""
Newcastle have spent 50 million pounds on players over the past five years, bankrolled by millionaire property developer Sir John Hall. Hall remains chairman of the football club but has not joined the board of the parent company where his son Douglas holds a controlling stake.
The investment has transformed the club from an ailing first division team into a Premier League force, although a major trophy has so far proved elusive.
Those transfer costs mean Newcastle has reported an operating loss in each of the past five years, although it was profitable in the six months to January of this year.
Bolton, in north-west England, were one of the 12 founders of the English Football League over a century ago.
They have languished in the lower divisions of English soccer for much of the past 20 years but believe that promotion to the Premier League and a move to a new 25,000-capacity stadium give them a sound basis for the future.

2884,"Granada Group Plc expressed optimism on Thursday about prospects for the sale of more than 20 British motorway service areas as it continues to dispose of assets acquired in its takeover of Forte.
Competition authorities have ordered British media and leisure group Granada to sell its 21 Welcome Break motorway sites by April because of monopoly concerns.
Granada acquired the business when it won control of hotel and catering empire Forte a year ago after a long and bitter takeover struggle.
""What we had was effectively about 18 players there who came in and showed interest and we've basically taken that down now to six/seven interested parties,"" Granada chief executive Charles Allen said in an interview when asked about the Welcome Break sale.
He said both trade buyers and financial players were among those in the running in a deal which share analysts believe could raise as much as 370 million pounds ($600 million).
Granada is in the process of selling off 17 luxury ""Exclusive"" hotels it acquired from Forte. Buyers have already been found for properties in London, Paris and Barbados.
The hotel sale could raise more than 800 million pounds but Allen made it clear that Granada could yet decide to keep hold of London's Grosvenor House, the largest and most valuable of the assets on the market.
Allen said Granada would only sell if it got ""the right price"" for the swish hotel. It is believed to be seeking a figure in excess of 300 million pounds for that one building.
He said that there was scope to double annual profits at the Grosvenor House to around 40 million pounds.
Granada also acquired the Meridien international hotel chain as part of the Forte deal. Allen said that Granada planned over the next few years to turn the operation into a pure management contract business.
The chain comprises more than 70 hotels, of which around 25 are owned and 50 are run on management contracts.
Allen said the eventual sale of the Meridien ""bricks and mortar"" was likely to be worth about 500 million pounds. ($1=.6172 Pound)

2893,"Leading British television companies BSkyB, Carlton Communications and Granada Group teamed up on Friday to apply to run digital terrestrial TV (DTT) services in Britain.
The formation of their British Digital Broadcasting venture, appeared to transform the prospects for DTT, previously dismissed as a ""lame duck"" technology.
British Digital Broadcasting has put in an application to run three DTT licences, offering 15 channels, including subscription channels from the BBC.
It faces competition from U.S. owned cable company International CableTel Inc, which has also put in an application for three of the four available networks.
The company is Britain's third largest cable operator and owns NTL, one of two major British transmission companies.
The BSkyB/Carlton/Granada/BBC venture plans three premium subscription channels showing top films and sporting action. Another 12 channels will be offered as part of a basic subscription package.
Shares in the three companies surged on Friday as markets welcomed the news. BSkyB added 21.5p to 602p, Carlton gained 21p to 540.5p and Granada added 12.5p to 890p.
DTT will broadcast from land-based transmitters to ordinary rooftop aerials. However, viewers will need a set-top decoder costing at least 200 pounds ($324) to receive the service.
There will be six digital networks or ""multiplexes"", each capable of broadcasting at least five channels. The first two have been earmarked for the existing, free, terrestrial broadcasters, the BBC and the ITV commercial network.
The other four will be awarded by the Independent Television Commission (ITC) watchdog body. The service is expected to be on the air by mid-1998.
Digital television offers more channels, clearer pictures and the possibility of accessing interactive services such as home shopping and home banking.
But DTT, with only 30 channels, had been seen as the poor relation to BSkyB's planned satellite version which will offer 200 channels.
BSkyB, in which Rupert Murdoch's News Corp is the leading shareholder, is expected to press on with its digital satellite launch in Britain later this year. DTT is seen as a complementary service.
""By plugging in one simple set top box, viewers will be able to see all the existing terrestrial channels, new free channels, the latest movies and the best sport,"" said Carlton chairman Michael Green.
Green will chair British Digital Broadcasting, and Carlton, Granada and BSkyB will each own one third of the company which unites Britain's leading commercial ITV companies with satellite pay operator BSkyB.
If successful in winning the three licences, the shareholders have agreed to meet between them a peak funding requirement of up to 300 million pounds. The company is expected to be profitable within five years.

2896,"Shares in British media group EMAP Plc tumbled about three percent on Monday after the company said it was losing managing director David Arculus to television and newspaper firm United News &amp; Media.
Arculus, 50, who joined EMAP in 1972, will move to United News on April 7 as chief operating officer. His responsibilites there will range from consumer publishing through television to trade magazines and exhibitions.
""David Arculus has demonstrated a sure touch as a builder of media businesses. His experience and proven record make him a valuable addition to the team,"" United chief executive Clive Hollick said.
United said the move completed the management team it has built since its three billion pound ($4.9 billion) merger with television and financial services group MAI last year.
United shares rose 17p to 704.5p after the announcement while EMAP fell 25p to 787.5p.
EMAP has been one of Britain's fastest growing businesses in recent years, selling out of its original regional newspaper base, and expanding its British local radio operations and its consumer magazine interests at home and in France.
But it was hit last year by a row over corporate governance which resulted in the ousting of two non-executive directors.
Chairman Sir John Hoskyns at that time played down talk of a boardroom rift between Arculus and chief executive Robin Miller over who would succeed him.
Share analysts said the departure of Arculus was worrying, coming so soon after last year's upheaval.
""The fact that Arculus is leaving is slightly disturbing,"" said Nick Ward of Credit Lyonnais Laing, noting however that it was impossible for a company to predict staff changes.
""But the place will not fall apart without him,"" Ward added, saying that EMAP was known for its strong divisional management.
Analysts also pointed out that the fall in EMAP shares came after a strong run which has seen them rise from 730p in December when the non-executive directors were removed.
EMAP's Miller said the company's board had not yet decided on who will succeed chairman Hoskyns when he retires next year.
Miller, who joined EMAP in 1965 as a reporter on Motor Cycle News, said there had been difficulties with Arculus but the partnership had worked well overall.
Arculus, EMAP managing director since 1990, said he was delighted to be joining United, a company whose businesses include British commercial television stations, two national newspapers and a trade exhibitions arm.
""I got offered a job about three times the size of the one I was doing at EMAP,"" Arculus told Reuters. His 1995 pay package was worth some 250,000 pounds but he would not be drawn on how much he would earn at United. ($1=.6142 Pound)

2898,"The battle for UK digital terrestrial television (DTT) licences is a David and Goliath contest pitting three of the country's biggest broadcasting groups against a little known cable company.
DTN, owned by Nasdaq-listed International CableTel, finds itself up against the might of pay television giant British Sky Broadcasting and ITV companies Carlton Communications Plc and Granada Group Plc.
But International CableTel chief executive Barclay Knapp has not yet raised the white flag as Britain's Independent Television Commission (ITC) considers the two bids.
""We are presenting ourselves as the ones that win on the merits,"" Knapp said in an interview on Wednesday.
""We are going to create an environment for new British programming to proliferate and to very aggressively exploit the interactive services component,"" he added.
Knapp believes that the successful launch of DTT is the best way to challenge BSkyB's dominance of UK pay television.
He also maintains that major programme makers and suppliers should not be left to run broadcast networks.
DTT signals are broadcast from land-based transmitters to ordinary aerials but viewers need a set-top box or decoder to view what is broadcast.
Digital compression improves sound and picture quality and means that more than 30 channels can be picked up. The technology permits a link to interactive services.
DTN and the rival British Digital Broadcasting consortium are each bidding for the same three blocks of frequencies, capable of carrying some 18 channels.
The ITC decision on the award of the licences is expected around May and DTT would begin in the spring or summer of 1998.
BSkyB plans separately to launch digital satellite services with up to 200 channels into the UK late this year and DTN questions its commitment to making the terrestrial version work.
International CableTel, the company behind DTN, has almost all its operations in the UK, where it is the third largest cable operator and also owns the NTL transmission network.
It believes its skills in programme packaging and marketing make it the ideal candidate to run DTT frequencies. Knapp points to International Cabletel's success in securing take up of around 40 percent in some of its cable franchise areas.
""Sports and movies are good for the first 20 percent in take-up but the two remaining factors are the breadth of choice and pricing,"" he said.
International CableTel breaks its programme packages down into tiers such as news or natural history to bring on board those not tempted by soccer or Hollywood blockbusters.
He believes that customers could be offered a limited package of say five extra DTT channels for around six pounds per month to get them to sample the multi-channel future.
""People don't want to dive right in, they just want to get their feet wet,"" he said.

2904,"Lawyers acting for Peter Young, the fund manager suspended last week by Morgan Grenfell Asset Management (MGAM), said on Monday there were no grounds for allegations of criminality and there had been no such allegation in the proceedings which had been served on him.
""There is no allegation of criminality in the proceedings which have been served on Peter Young and there would be no grounds whatsoever for any such allegation,"" solicitors Peters &amp; Peters said in a statement.  
Young was suspended when MGAM, a subsidiary of German banking giant Deutsche Bank AG, said it had found ""suspected irregularities"" in three of its funds, two of which were managed by him.
Young, whose personal assets were frozen after MGAM and fund trustee Royal Bank of Scotland obtained an injunction, has not been available for comment.
Trading in the funds was halted last Monday but resumed on Thursday after a 180 million pounds ($280.7 million) cash injection by Deutsche Bank and reassurances that investors would not lose out.  
The problems centre on the valuation of the high proportion of unlisted high-technology stocks held in the funds. They are being investigated by British investments watchdog the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (IMRO).
Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO), which prosecutes major financial crimes has taken no official action. It has been in contact with IMRO, but has so far only been kept briefed on developments and denies a criminal investigation is underway.  
""Weekend reports that the SFO was about to get involved were wholly speculative. The director must have reasonable grounds to suspect that serious or complex fraud offences have taken place,"" SFO spokesman James O'Donoghue told Reuters on Monday.
The probe into what took place within MGAM is widely expected to take some time, with a complex web of holdings and companies around the world to be unravelled.
Both MGAM and IMRO have drafted in forensic accountants to look into the fund management business of the three funds, MGAM has enlisted Ernst &amp; Young and IMRO Deloitte Touche.  
MGAM has also appointed law firm Slaughter &amp; May to help untangle a labyrinth of investments. Slaughter &amp; May confirmed its appointment but would not comment on the investigation.
The fall-out of the episode for Deutsche Bank continued on Monday with the news from credit rating agency Moody's that it is looking at the bank's rare and treasured triple-A credit rating in the light of the MGAM situation.
And investment bank Salomon Brothers said the worry that Deutsche Bank might return to its accident prone image of the early 1990s may be the most serious concern stemming from problems at the bank's asset management arm.  
But Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, the bank's investment banking arm, said redemptions from the funds had dropped by over half on Monday compared to the 83 million pounds redeemed last Friday and the 110 million pounds which flooded out last Thursday.
""Just under 39 million pounds was redeemed today,"" DMG spokesman James Murray told Reuters. ""As expected the redemptions have slowed down significantly. There is still enough cash left in the funds.""
""What we are seeing is a stabilisation,"" he added.  
He said there had been just over 300 million pounds in the funds after the Deutshe cash injection and if redemptions continued to drop there would be sufficient cash.
Murray confirmed that investors would be compensated, but that the amount would only be decided after the investigation. ""If compensation is found to be due then it will be paid by us,"" he said, adding that it would be calculated by an independent accountant appointed by IMRO.
He said the preliminary part of MGAM's investigation would take between four and six weeks. ($1=.6412 Pound)

2906,"Canada's TrizecHahn Corp and German businessman Dieter Bock on Wednesday unveiled a European property alliance which analysts said underlined increasing confidence in the market.
""This shows further faith being expressed in the UK and European property market,"" a property analyst at one major European investment bank said.
Toronto-based TrizecHahn, which has $6.0 billion in assets and $1.2 billion in uncommitted capital, said it would buy British and German property projects from Bock's Advanta Management AG for around $147 million.
It said it would pay for the acquisitions by issuing subordinate voting shares to Bock, as well as by assuming development liabilities and through construction financing.
Steve Mallen, head of research at property consultants Knight Frank, praised the timing of the move, saying: ""This is a wise strategic move, I think their timing is perfect.""
Bock will become president of TrizecHahn Europe and a director of the company, with an equity stake of around four percent. At the same time Bock announced he would resign as non-executive deputy chairman of Lonrho Plc and also as a director of the British- based trading and hotels conglomerate.
""The opportunity at TrizecHahn will demand my full attention,"" Bock said.
Both parties said the partnership represented an important strategic move, reflecting its commitment to expanding outside North America. Under the terms of the deal, which is expected to close in April, TrizecHahn's existing European operations will be merged with its new German and British development projects under Bock's leadership.
Peter Munk, TrizecHahn's chairman and chief executive, told a telephone news conference he was excited by the deal, which would allow the marriage of the firm's asset base and experience with Bock's ""experience, presence and credibility"" in Europe.
Munk said the deal would widen TrizecHahn's horizons beyond Eastern Europe to the whole of the European market. He said the company's involvement would encompass both development and investment in property in Europe.
He had not done business with Bock before, he said, but the two had become good friends out of a common interest in gold mining.
Bock said he was bringing in expertise built up in Europe and would strengthen the European management capacity.
The projects being taken over by TrizecHahn were a commercial property, Number 1 Poultry in London's City financial district, two commercial developments in Berlin, one in Dresden and a Baltic Sea project.
TrizecHahn, one of North America's largest publicly traded real estate developers, was formed from the merger last November of Horsham Corporation and Trizec Corporation Ltd.

Horlick had been suspended on Tuesday pending the outcome of an internal investigation into what Deutsche Morgan Grenfell described as ""a potential breach of her contract"".
The dispute was believed to revolve around allegations Horlick was looking to move and take staff with her. It follows a scandal last year at MGAM over misvaluations in three of its funds and the subsequent sacking of fund manager Peter Young.
The suspension of Horlick, dubbed superwoman in financial circles because of her ability to hold a high-powered job while looking after five children, prompted reports of unease among large pension fund clients at the firm.
The row erupted only days after Horlick received news of a promotion to managing director from MGAM chief executive Robert Smith, a banking source said. ""They shook hands on it last Friday,"" the source said.
Horlick, in an interview with the Financial Times published on Friday, described disquiet at MGAM over the Young affair. She said the promotion came after a group of fund managers who worked under her said they would leave the company unless she be given more authority.
""They demanded that I be given more authority. They felt that things were in turmoil following the Peter Young affair.""
Young, currently under investigation by Britain's Serious Fraud Office, has denied any involvement in criminal activity.
The Horlick saga is said to have unsettled pension fund clients at DMG, but the company said earlier on Thursday that it did not expect any exodus of its pension fund clients.
Banking sources also said DMG was confident other fund managers would not follow in Horlick's footsteps and that there was a climate of loyalty to MGAM's Smith.
But DMG has been in the spotlight for months over the Peter Young affair, which has been costly as well as embarassing. In December Deutsche Bank agreed to a compensation package of around 200 million pounds ($335 million) to make good losses suffered by investors. Deutsche also saw its coveted triple-A credit rating from Moody's dropped last month.
In October Deutsche named Rolf Breuer, a 58-year-old investment banker, as its new head. Breuer will take over on May 20 and is expected to fight hard to avoid the criticism and mistrust that dogged his predecessor Hilmar Kopper.
Kopper never managed to shrug off the ""peanuts"" tag attached to him in 1994 after he used the word to describe losses caused by the collapse of the Schneider property empire, with which Deutsche was closely involved.
Peanuts are just about the last word the British press have been using in connection with Horlick. She was reported to have earned one million pounds ($1.68 million) a year.
In the newspaper interview, she tells of a last attempt to solve things with DMG when she met with Smith on Wednesday. ""The meeting ended up with me in tears and Robert Smith very depressed,"" she was quoted as saying. Horlick said a request to be reinstated was rejected by Smith on Thursday, the FT said.
There has been press speculation Horlick was preparing a move to Dutch bank ABN AMRO with others in her team, but ABN has denied any attempt of poaching a fund manager team. It declined to say whether it had tried to hire Horlick.
In the interview Horlick said, ""ABN AMRO is a red herring,"" adding: ""I completely concur with what ABN AMRO have said.""

2920,"Deutsche Morgan Grenfell was unlikely to offer Nicola Horlick her job back, despite the former fund manager's continuing call for reinstatement, banking sources said.
""The ball's in her court,"" a banking source said late on Sunday, adding that Horlick's resignation last week meant that DMG's Morgan Grenfell Asset Management (MGAM) was no longer obliged to discuss reinstatement with her.
Deutsche Morgan Grenfell was preparing to launch an intensive campaign to shore up its pension fund business in the wake of Horlick's resignation at MGAM after she was suspended for allegedly trying to lure staff with her to another firm.
The investment banking arm of Germany's mighty Deutsche Bank was to meet key clients, but DMG spokesman James Murray denied pension firms were considering moving from its 18 billion pound ($30.11 billion) funds.
""We've had absolutely no indication that our institutional pension fund clients have plans at this stage to move their business,"" he said.
Morgan Grenfell Asset Management (MGAM), the fund management arm of DMG, has already written to all its pension fund clients to limit any fall-out from the suspension and later resignation last week of senior British fund manager Horlick.
Some clients, including London's Westminster City Council, Scotland's Dumfries and Galloway County Council and the Merchant Navy Officers' Pension Fund, have expressed individual concern about recent events at MGAM.
And the Railway Pension Trustee Company, which has 1.25 billion pounds with MGAM, said it had met MGAM officials and would be in close contact with its asset managers.
Meanwhile, Horlick continued to deny the allegations that she had tried to lure staff away from MGAM.
""I think my colleagues know that's not the case,"" she told BBC television as reporters swarmed around her on Sunday.
Horlick was suspended from the firm only days after she had been promoted to managing director at MGAM.
Her subsequent resignation as head of MGAM's British pension fund business and dramatic dash to Frankfurt on Friday to plead with Deutsche Bank for her reinstatement received widespread coverage in British media.
""These people who I spoke to in Germany were very, very serious about all of this. And I want to give them a chance to sort this out,"" Horlick said on BBC television.
""What I really want is a proper resolution. And I still think that that means either reinstatement -- and I mean that, I like doing my job. Reinstatement or compensation,"" she added.
MGAM is still trying to regain an even keel after last year's revelations of irregularities at three of its retail investment funds, the sacking of fund manager Peter Young, a 180 million pound cash injection to bolster the funds and the announcement of a 200 million pound compensation package.
Young, who denies any involvement in criminal activity, is now under investigation by Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO).
Much of the media coverage of Horlick's case has focused on the ""human interest"" angle with pictures of the 35-year-old -- dubbed Superwoman by British newspapers -- with her children at their luxury home in Kensington, west London.
Fund management sources said Horlick, who stated she managed between three-and-a-half and four billion pounds worth of the firm's business, had talked about a management buy-out.
But they said that even if this had been discussed informally it would have had no hope of success as DMG, along with many other firms, was keen to build its strength in this lucrative area and would not dismantle its business.
Horlick, who during a whirlwind campaign on Friday entered MGAM's London headquarters in an attempt to meet management and loudly proclaimed ""Justice will be done"", has said she wants to settle her differences as quickly as possible and is pinning her hopes on further talks with a Deutsche legal official.
She has said she plans legal action over what she claims was her ""constructive dismissal"" by the firm. But banking sources said it had not yet been served with any legal papers.
Horlick's spokesman distanced her from reports a December lunch meeting had marked the start of talks with Dutch bank ABN AMRO on a move there. He said it had been a personal engagement and ""there was nothing culpable about meeting a friend...for lunch"".
ABN AMRO has denied it tried to poach any MGAM staff. ($1=.5979 Pound)

2922,"Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) was on Thursday drawn closer to the probe into alleged irregularities in three Morgan Grenfell investment funds.
At the same time it emerged the investigation had cast its net overseas, as City regulatory sources confirmed newspaper reports that the inquiry extended beyond Britain. The SFO said it was involved but was not mounting its own investigation.
A spokeswoman for the SFO said the office was in contact with Britain's investment watchdog the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (IMRO) which would share any relevant material with the office. The SFO investigates and prosecutes major financial crimes in the City of London.
The Times newspaper said in its Friday edition that a senior SFO lawyer had been briefed officially by IMRO. It added that overseas authorities, in the U.S., Luxembourg and Switzerland, had also been involved in the process.
""We have been in contact with IMRO. IMRO are investigating and will share anything of relevance with us,"" the SFO spokeswoman told Reuters on Thursday.
And after the funds, which were suspended on Monday, resumed trading, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, the UK-based investment banking arm of Germany's Deutsche Bank, said nearly eight percent of three Morgan Grenfell investment funds being investigated for alleged irregularities had been redeemed.
The funds, run by Morgan Grenfell Asset Management (MGAM), were suspended due to suspected ""irregularities,"" but resumed trading after Deutsche Bank spent 180 million pounds ($282.4 million) removing certain unlisted securities from the funds.
""This is good news because people were predicting they would be selling lots...but there has been no panic selling,"" said Deutsche Morgan Grenfell spokesman James Murray.
Industry sources, however, said that redemptions of eight percent in one day was a major reverse.
IMRO's own probe into MGAM has already led to the suspension of two fund managers and briefly saw trading halted in three MGAM funds, which have around 90,000 small investors.
Sources in both the British banking and fund management industries said the probe appeared to be focusing on links between suspended MGAM fund manager Peter Young and a UK-based broker, Fiba Nordic Securities.
Young was not immediately available for comment.
And a spokesman for Fiba Nordic Securities in London said the firm welcomed any investigation and denied any improper relationship with MGAM. Fiba has been a broker and valuer for funds managed by MGAM.
British regulatory sources said the UK's Securities and Futures Authority (SFA) had previously been examining the activities of Fiba over another matter. This had subsequently led to the unofficial investigation by IMRO into MGAM which prompted Young's suspension.
Young, whose personal assets were frozen as a result of a high-court injunction last night, was suspended from MGAM on Monday. MGAM announced on Wednesday evening that a second manager, Stewart Armer, had also been suspended.
DMG said Armer was suspended on Wednesday evening ""following the discovery of a suspected breach of personal account dealing rules."" A source close to the investigation said Armer's assets would not be frozen and he was not a central focus of the probe. Armer was not available for comment.
In Frankfurt, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank said neither Young nor Armer had committed an obvious breach of regulations. ""But both were hovering on the brink of a grey area,"" spokesman Detlev Rahmsdorf told Reuters.
According to sources close to the investigation, the probe is trying to determine whether the fund's investments in unquoted stocks were valued above their real worth.
The fall-out spread to Sweden where Young had invested substantially in unlisted stocks. Stocks held in his portfolio fell amid concerns from Swedish officials about the impact of the probe on Sweden's alternative stock market.
In Britain the saga is likely to lead to a reappraisal of how funds are managed.
""We will be reviewing our collective investment scheme rules, in particular, the valuation of unquoted securities and the position of prelisted stocks,"" a spokesman at Britain's Securities and Investments Board (SIB) told Reuters.

2923,"British property group Hammerson Plc's chief executive Ron Spinney said on Monday he expected the British market to perform well over the next two years.
""I think the market will perform well over the next two years,"" Spinney told Reuters.
Earlier the group announced a 21.3 percent rise in pre-tax profit for 1996 to 70.0 million stg from 1995's 57.7 million stg. Net asset value (NAV) per share rose 3.2 percent to 388 pence from 376 pence.  
Spinney said Hammerson had had ""another good year"", including turning over 15 percent of the portfolio, investing 50 million stg on improving existing properties and embarking on an 800 million stg development programme.
He said the group would be spending around 115 million stg on its existing portfolio and its developments.
""We have taken steps to ensure growth in the future...The UK market for shopping centres and offices is bouyant,"" he added.  
Spinney said there were signs the French market was in a similar position to where the British market had been about two years before, adding he was confident there had been rises in values since the end of the year in Britain.
Hammerson's gearing is currently ""relatively modest"" at 58 percent, Spinney said, adding that the group itended acquiring more properties over the year, this would be split between areas and sectors.
""We are generally happy with it (the split) as it is at the present time,"" he said.

2938,"NatWest Markets said on Monday that its senior management did not know about the interest rate options pricing problem until three days before the losses were made public.
""Senior management did not know until February 25 that there was potentially something of significance,"" a NatWest spokeswoman told Reuters.
She denied a weekend newspaper report suggesting that NatWest, the investment banking arm of Britain's National Westminster Bank Plc knew of the losses some time before they were revealed.
The mispricings, which on Thursday NatWest revealed had totalled 90 million pounds ($144 million), had come to light during the course of normal pricing reviews and it had not been able to put a price on the loss until February 28, when NatWest estimated it at 50 million pounds.
The initial discovery of the loss came to light through a more intensive review across the investment bank's trading areas, but it was a month or so before the extent of the mispricings became clear.
The options losses have been a painful and embarrassing episode for NatWest Markets and its chief executive Martin Owen, who on Thursday said he would forgo 200,000 of a 500,000 pound bonus as a result of the affair.
NatWest confirmed a report that the girlfriend of Kyriacos Papouis, the former NatWest options trader whom NatWest wants to interview about the losses, also worked for the bank but was employed in derivatives marketing and had nothing to do with Papouis's work.
She had been given a holiday period because of the situation, the spokeswoman added.
Papouis, who left NatWest for U.S. investment bank Bear Stearns, has not commented on the losses. Since the affair came to light he has also resigned from Bear Stearns.
He and five others have been reported to British financial watchdog the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA) and the Bank of England is also looking into what went wrong at the bank.
NatWest Markets' global head of options, Neil Dodgson, who was suspended from the firm more than two weeks ago when the losses first came to light, is among those who will come under SFA scrutiny.
The others suspended last week were Ian Gaskell, head of swaps options trading for Britain and Europe, Christophe Lanson, global head of rate risk management, Jean-Francois Nguyen, managing director of debt derivatives, and Phil Wise, chief administrative officer and formerly senior managing director of capital markets.
While the group has maintained that it does not believe any of its clients suffered losses as a result of the options mispricing, which went back as far as 1994, the spokeswoman declined to comment on whether NatWest would try to recoup any gains made by counterparties to any wrongly priced deals.
""We haven't determined that that is an issue,"" she said.
She dismissed suggestions that morale was low at the bank following last week's revelation that the loss was nearly twice as large as initially thought, the suspension of four senior staff and the cutting of bonuses to a handful of individuals.
""We are doing really good business here, and we continue to do good business. Everybody wants this to be dealt with properly and put behind us,"" she said.
Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO), which investigates and prosecutes major and complex financial crime, has been contacted by NatWest but has not begun an investigation.

2946,"British estate agency and financial products group Hambro Countrywide Plc has capitalised on the housing market recovery and is prepared for further growth.
The company said on Thursday it had turned around a pre-tax loss of 3.9 million pounds for 1995 into a pre-tax profit of 30.8 million pounds for 1996 and promised there was more to come.
""I think we are only half way there yet...if we get to anything like the volumes that we anticipate this year...the prospects are obviously very exciting,"" managing director Harry Hill told Reuters. Hill said the British housing market was improving across the country, although there were still regional differences. He said London and the south east were outpacing other areas, but added he did not believe prices would rise unsustainably.
""I suspect it will find a level,"" he said. ""There's an enormous momentum that will probably sustain the market this year and next before it even starts to draw breath,"" he added.
All the factors were in place for a long, sustained recovery in Britain and within that context house prices would increase.
Hambro Countrywide, which is 52 percent owned by British merchant bank Hambros Plc, also announced that it had broken with tradition and made a move into the burgeoning London market by buying an estate agency and letting business for 7.45 million pounds.
Faron Sutaria &amp; Co has five existing branches in London and plans to expand in the west, south and north west of the capital. ""From the middle of this year we will have nine offices under Faron's banner and we would hope in the next two years to have another seven,"" Hill said. Hambro Countrywide said the entire management team at Faron wanted to stay with the business, adding that the acquisition offered the opportunity to generate additional revenue by offering mortgages and financial services to new clients. Hill does not see the impending British election slowing Hambro Countrywide's business and said a victory for the opposition Labour party could in fact benefit the firm's clients. ""I don't think it will make much difference either way,"" he said.
He said Hambro Countrywide had sold more mortgages and retail financial services during February than in any other month in its history.
And there was no sign of change to the direct correlation between people buying houses and financial products from the group. ""Most people want to do most things if they can, easily and comfortably under one roof,"" Hill said.
While there are a growing number of competitors in the market-place, Hill said he did not see Hambro Countrywide's margins being pinched as a result.
Asked if Hambro Countrywide planned to make any further acquisitions, Hill said ""We aren't talking to anyone today"". But the group said it was in discussions with a ""number of leading law firms"" as part of a move to set up a conveyancing operation.
""We believe this will bring significant benefits to all our clients in smoothing and speeding up the home buying process,"" the group said, adding it expected to open its first centre in April 1997.
As for Hambro Countrywide's own future, chairman Christopher Sporborg said there was little chance of a change in the current shareholding by Hambros.
Shares in Hambro Countrywide, which also announced a final dividend of 1.5 pence to make a total dividend of 2.0 pence, were down 4.0 pence at 1100 GMT at 123.5 pence.

2951,"British household products group Reckitt and Colman Plc is expected to report a 15 percent increase in its full year profits on Thursday, as the benefits of its acquisition of L&amp;F Products feeds through.
Analysts forecasts for 1996 pretax profits range from 314 to 320 million stg, up from 285 million last time. Estimates of the total dividend range from 21.8 to 22.6 pence.
The group, known for brands ranging from Mr Sheen polish and Brasso, to Dettol disinfectant, acquired L&amp;F Products, maker of America's best-selling disinfectant Lysol, for one billion pounds in 1994.
""The real driver will come from the benefits of intergrating L&amp;F, which will bring substantial cost-savings,"" said one analyst who declined to be named.
At the half year stage, the company reported sales up 5.3 percent, although turnover in the United States grew more strongly at 7.0 percent. In Europe underlying sales were flat due to sluggish economic activity and stiffer competition.
""It's primarily from the U.S., where we expect growth. We have had encouraging signs from management in the last couple of months on that one,"" said an analyst.
At the half year stage, pretax profits grew to 165 million stg from 149.6 million. Turnover from continuing operations grew by just four percent during the period to 1.16 billion stg.
The company continues to face competition in Britain and mainland Europe from larger retail chains selling cheaper own-brand products.
Reckitt has targetted South America and Asia, where it believes consumers are more influenced by brand names. Last year sales in eastern Asia rose by 25 percent, while in Brazil turnover jumped 20 percent.
The company generates about 32 percent of revenue from Europe, a similar amount from North America and 18 percent from emerging markets.
Reckitt shares have risen sharply in recent weeks amid market rumout that it may fall victim to a takeover bid by Unilever.
But the investment community has now largely dismissed this, arguing that it does not fit the fast moving consumer goods sector that Unilever Plc has identified as one of its favourites, nor does it have enough of a presence in emerging markets.
The shares have risen more than a pound since the rumours emerged, to the current 805p level and many analysts think this sort of bid premium now makes it too expensive as a takeover candidate.
""Our view is that on balance Unilever probably have higher targets on their list as in some ways Reckitt replicates Unilever in terms of its geographic exposure and I think Unielver wants to expand more rapidly in emerging markets,"" said Carl Short, analyst at SocGen.
R&amp;C's stated aim is to become the world leader in household products and dominate over the counter pharmaceuticals.
The company's whose name used to be synonomous with Britain's favourite mustard Coleman's now generates only about five percent of its trading profit from food operations.

2958,"Anglo-Dutch consumer products group Unilever NV/Plc Tuesday reported a 15 percent rise in pre-tax profits for 1996 and said it was putting its speciality chemicals businesses up for sale.
Pre-tax profit rose to 2.66 billion pounds ($4.4 billion) on a 6 percent rise in revenues to 33.52 billion ($54.7 billion). 2.
Unilever's stock surged on the results, which were better than the 53 billion pounds ($4.13 billion) analysts had forecast, and the planned sale of the speciality chemicals businesses.
Chairman Niall FitzGerald said the overall economic situation in 1997 was likely to be generally favourable, as in 1996, but he warned about market conditions in Europe, particularly France and Germany.
He said the planned sale of Unilever's speciality chemicals businesses would enable the company to concentrate on achieving growth in its consumer goods operations, particularly in developing and emerging markets.
""We will now seek actively buyers for the totality or the individual businesses and we will then assess those over the next month or two,"" he told Reuters in an interview. ""We would hope to conclude a sale in the course of the next three to six months.""
FitzGerald declined to say how much the businesses might be worth. The four units -- National Starch and Chemical Company, Quest International, Unichema International and Crosfield -- have combined revenue of 3.0 billion pounds ($4.9 billion), 9 percent of Unilever's total sales, and showed operating profit of 415 million pounds ($678 million) in 1996, with profit margins of 14.1 percent.
""These are extremely large and important parts of our businesses, but for some time we have been reviewing whether they should be a continuing part of the portfolio -- not because they are poorly performing themselves, they are excellent performers -- but whether we can give them the concentration and the focus that they require,"" FitzGerald said.
""They are essentially industrial businesses selling not to consumers but to intermediate customers. They are very fine businesses,"" he said. ""But if you look at the way this industry is developing, we have to take a decision either to significantly improve our presence in these markets, perhaps double it, or to exit and in exiting to concentrate on the other 90 percent of our business, which is our mainstream consumer goods business.""
The four companies together make up one of the world's largest speciality chemicals groups, employing 15,800 people in more than 35 countries.
Unilever is the world's largest producer of both margarine and ice cream, and its activities span food, personal products, such as Pond's cold cream, and household goods brands, including laundry detergents and Lux soap.
In Europe, Unilever's overall results in 1996 were held back by the impact of poor weather on ice cream sales and the impact of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy beef crisis.
""We see little reason, however, to believe that conditions in Europe, particularly in France and Germany, will improve,"" FitzGerald said.
Good progress in North American market conditions provided the basis for better results, and the momentum of growth continued strongly in the fast-growing emerging markets.

2963,"Drinks group Guinness Plc assured investors on Friday that its joint ventures with French luxury goods company LVMH were secure despite a decision by LVMH to sell a third of its shares in Guinness.
""Our commercial arrangements with LVMH are unaffected by this announcement,"" said Guinness finance director Phil Yea.
Guinness and LVMH's champagne and cognac arm Moet Hennessey operate some 15 joint ventures worldwide, including a New York company which distributes their top brands like Dewar's scotch and Moet champagne in the United States.
LVMH Moet Hennessey Louis Vuitton sold 135 million of its Guinness shares or about 7.0 percent of its holding in the company, at 414p per share, to raise about 559 million pounds ($934.9 million).
Analysts said the sale was driven by a number of factors, including rumours circulating in London that LVMH needs the funds to buy the rest of American duty free chain DFS, and by the strength of sterling against the French franc.
LVMH currently owns 58.75 percent of DFS.
""I don't think LVMH liked the trading statement from Guinness on Wednesday, it showed that the market for spirits is just not going to get any better. I think they have just had enough of the rotten share price performance of Guinness over the years,"" said one analyst who declined to be named.
LVMH said it would keep its remaining 14 percent stake in Guinness and seek to further develop the longstanding business ties between the two companies.
Guinness said the sale meant they each now owned a similar amount of each other's shares and the company snapped up 2.3 percent of its shares released by the LVMH sale.
""In 1994, Guinness reduced the amount of capital invested to secure its long term involvement in Moet Hennessey and today's part disposal by LVMH has a similar effect from their perspective,"" said Yea.
The LVMH sale gives it a stake of 268 million Guinness shares worth 1.14 billion pounds, while Guinness' stake in Moet Hennessey was valued at 1.026 billion in its last annual report.
The original cross-shareholding of 12 percent was taken up in 1988 but had crept up to 24 percent by 1994 when the relationship was reformed.
Guinness agreed to sell its 24 percent stake in exchange for a 34 percent holding in Moet Hennessey plus cash, while LVMH agreed to bring its Guinness stake down to 20 percent.
At the time, both companies also agreed that if LVMH ever reduced its stake in Guinness to below 15 percent it could not raise it again without a special shareholders' resolution.
Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH, has a seat on the main Guinness board and Guinness chairman Tony Greener has a seat on the LVMH board. Guinness also has two seats on the six-strong Moet Hennessy board.
Insiders say the relationship between Arnault and Guinness has been stormy and uncertain in recent years.
Analysts have had to second guess his next move against the background of a poor performance from Guinness shares relative to the sector and the stock market over the last five years.
""It takes away the fear that LVMH would sell the lot and it means that Guinness has got an excellent deal in terms of buying at a price which won't recur,"" said Ron Littleboy, analyst at Nomura.
Guinness's shares initially fell 22p to 414p in early trade before rebounding to 430, after Guinness announced it had repurchased some of its own shares.
The company currently has shareholder approval to buy back up to 10 percent of its own shares and many analysts expect it to buy back more after its full year results on March 20.

Pre-tax profit rose to 2.66 billion pounds ($4.4 billion) on a 6 percent rise in revenues to 33.52 billion ($54.7 billion). 2.
Unilever shares surged on the results, which were better than analysts had forecast, and on the planned speciality chemicals sale.
Unilever Plc shares surged 86-1/2 pence to 1,479-1/2 ($24.17) in London as some looked to raise 1997 forecasts.
Chairman Niall FitzGerald said the sale of the speciality chemicals businesses would enable the group to concentrate on achieving growth in its consumer goods operations, particularly in developing and emerging markets.
Analysts said the sale, which could free Unilever up for a major acquisition in its main food, detergents and personal products businesses, was well timed.
FitzGerald said, meanwhile, that the overall economic situation in 1997, as in 1996, was likely to be generally favourable for the group, which is the world's largest producer of both margarine and ice cream, with activities from food to toiletries.
But he saw little reason to believe that conditions in Europe, particularly in France and Germany, would improve.
""We will now seek actively buyers for the totality or the individual (chemicals) businesses and we will then assess those over the next month or two,"" FitzGerald told Reuters. ""We would hope to conclude a sale in the course of the next three to six months.""
FitzGerald declined to say how much the businesses, with 15,800 staff in more than 35 countries, might be worth.
Analysts estimate the sale should fetch 4.5 billion to 5 billion pounds ($7.35 billion to 8.17 billion), and FitzGerald told a news conference in the short term it would wipe out the company's net borrowings of 1.7 billion pounds ($2.78 billion).
The funds would also be used for acquisitions in growth areas, FitzGerald told reporters, such as Asia Pacific and South America and in priority categories like detergents, tea, ice cream, yellow fats, personal care products and fragrances.
""We have a carefully defined list of what we may do with (the proceeds), which I am not prepared to discuss,"" he said. ""In China I would like to have a business 10 times the size.""
The four units -- National Starch and Chemical Company, Quest International, Unichema International and Crosfield -- have combined turnover of 3 billion pounds ($4.9 billion), 9 percent of Unilever's total sales, and showed operating profit of 415 million ($678 million) in 1996, with margins of 14.1 percent.

Commenting on the overall results, Unilever said its performance in Europe was held back by poor weather hitting ice cream sales and by the impact of the mad cow disease crisis.

2972,"British brewing to leisure group Bass Plc said on Monday it had sold 47 Holiday Inn full service hotels and 14 Holiday Inn management contracts in the mid-market sector in North America to the Bristol Hotel Company.
In return Bass will take a 36.1 percent stake in Bristol, which it plans to retain, plus loan repayments totalling $300 million and $91 million in cash, to be used in the business.
This results in a total value of $640 million for the deal, although based on the closing price of Bristol stock on Friday it is valued at $659 million.
Bass' decision to sell the hotels fits with its declared strategy of expanding its Holiday Inn franchise system and exiting from owning and managing hotels in areas where it has established a presence in franchising.
""We have always seen franchising as our primary business. Owning and managing hotels is simply a means of supporting that operation,"" said Bass finance director Richard North.
""We have reached the point in the U.S. where that is no longer necessary and where we are at the appropriate time in the cycle to sell these assets,"" said North in an interview.
The 61 hotels transferred, which have a book value of $638 million, generated profits of $69 million in the financial year to September 30 after payment of franchise fees. Bristol will spend $150 million on refurbishing the properties over the next three years.
Bass, which confirmed last week it was in talks with Bristol, said the deal would have no significant effect on its earnings.
In a separate statement issued in New York Bristol said the acquisition should improve earnings slightly in 1997, excluding the cost of integrating the 61 hotels and transaction fees.
Holiday Inn franchisees in the United States get about 33 percent of their occupancy through the Holiday Inn reservation system compared with 13 percent on average in Europe.
""We believe we are way up on the cycle in the U.S. In fact our assessment is that there is a little bit left to go, but of course you can only really tell with hindsight,"" said North, referring to property prices in the United States.
Bass shares were off 15p at 800p after the stock went ex-dividend from the start of trading on Monday.
""It allows them to get out at a reasonable price and invest the cash in areas of expansion like the Far East,"" said Dermott Carr, an analyst at Nikko Europe.
Bristol also agreed to convert a further 10 of its 39 existing hotels to the Holiday Inn brand. These conversions, together with the 61 hotels transferred under the deal, will result in 84 out of 100 Bristol properties being named Holiday Inn or Crowne Plaza.
Bass owns 60 Holiday Inns in Europe, the Middle East and Africa and 39 in the Asia-Pacific region. It has no plans to sell its Crowne Plaza hotels in North America.
Under the Holiday Inn franchise scheme, hoteliers pay a fee to join, relative to room numbers, plus five percent of gross room revenues per annum. They also pay a 0.5 percent fee for access to the computer booking system and a one percent annual fee for marketing, both linked to room revenue.

2985,"British cider maker Matthew Clark outlined a recovery plan on Tuesday aimed at tackling the phenomenal rise in popularity of ""alcopops"" and a cut throat industry-wide price war.
""We have drawn a line under the issues we face,"" said business development director Peter Huntley in an interview.
The company estimates it will lose 22 miillion pounds ($36.80 million) over the year from a combination of lower sales and tougher competition over pricing and supply contracts to national and regional brewers.
Sales of Diamond White and K cider were off some 30 percent due to the emergence of ""alcopops"", costing Matthew Clark about 11 million pounds in annual profits.
""The decline in Diamond White and K is still in progress, but it is a quiet period of the year and our marketing plan will hit the market in April and we expect it to arrest the decline very quickly,"" he said.
Alcopops -- cola and fruit flavoured alcoholic drinks -- have grown to annualised sales of 80 million litres a year in 18 months and hit sales of Diamond White, the dominant premium packaged cider brand, six times more than premium lagers.
Price competition produced deep promotional discounts in supermarkets and will cost Matthew Clark about four million pounds in lost profits at the full year, said Huntley.
""The level of discounting and below the line price support, and promotional support this summer has been at levels which have just not been seen in the cider industry for the last five years,"" he said.
""For example on a two-litre Old English and Blackthorn, the discounting we had to do this summer to match the market was to take 30 percent off the price, so it was down from 2.99 pounds and 3.19 pounds to 1.99 pounds.""
But Huntley said Clark ""expects to pull back on the level of promotional discount"" that went on during the summer.
Matthew Clark now has a 38 percent market share, down some three to four percentage points over the last year, putting it well behind its larger rival Bulmer HP Holdings Plc which has some 52 percent of the market.
The company unveiled a plan to spend more on advertising in an effort to rebuild its cider brands, including a new campaign for Diamond White aimed at bringing back 18 to 24-year-old drinkers and the relaunch of Blackthorn in the spring.
It also pledged to increase prices from this month and do away with deep promotional discounts in supermarkets.
Matthew Clark shares rose 30p to 330p by early afternoon with analysts saying they liked the frank way the company had presented its recovery strategy.
The company's shares plunged 60 percent after a profits warning in September, wiping more than 290 million pounds off its market value.
""They gave an open, frank and honest assessment of what there problems were and what they are going to do to sort them out,"" said Merrill Lynch analyst John Beaumont.
""A lot depends on how Bulmer will react, of course. Will they both stop cutting each other's throats and stop chasing each other's accounts?"" he said. ($1=.5979 Pound)

""There is a natural and gradual process of out-sourcing catering, which will continue at least until the year 2000.

2996,"British betting and Hilton hotel company Ladbroke Group Plc on Thursday posted a 34 percent increase in 1996 pretax profits to 163 million pounds ($263 million) before exceptional items and forecast further good progress during 1997.
Chief executive Peter George also made positive remarks about trading since its 1996 year ended on December 31.
""The same trend has continued in the last two months. The businesses are doing well. It does seem to be getting gradually better this year in mainland Europe,"" George said in an interview. Trading profits from its European hotels fell slightly in 1996.
""In Germany we have seen a few patchy signs of improvement. A few of our properties have actually done better in the first couple of months this year than last year but I would not say that augurs for a recovery this year.""
""I think it will take up to another 12 months for Germany to come back.""
Revenue per available room (RevPar) in hotels in mainland Europe fell to 50.8 pounds in 1996 from 52.1 pounds. In London it rose to 70.4 pounds from 60.4 and to 37.9 pounds from 33.2 pounds elsewhere in Britain.
""Japan is still tough I must say, Tokyo and particularly for us Osaka where new properties have been opened,"" George said.
Overall hotel occupancy levels rose slightly to 69.6 percent from 69 percent and group RevPar moved from 48 pounds to 49.3 pounds.
Ladbroke shares put on 10p to reach 235p in morning trade as the company's headline profit figure pipped the consensus forecast from brokers of 160 million pounds.
""The results were a little better than our expectations at both the pretax and the earnings per share level,"" said Nigel Reed, industry analyst at Paribas Capital Markets. Earnings per share before exceptional items were up 40 percent to 10.44 pence during the period.
Hilton International, which operates Hilton hotels outside the United States, increased trading profits by an underlying 20 percent to 160.2 million, and the betting and gaming division grew profits by 46 percent to 84.9 million.
Ladbroke and Hilton Hotels Corp agreed to reunite the Hilton hotels brand worldwide for the first time in 32 years in January. Previously HHC had the rights to the Hilton name in the United States and Ladbroke owned them elsewhere.
""Betting was much better than we thought and hotels were slightly under what we thought they could do,"" Reed said.
Ladbroke's retail betting business in Britain showed a marked recovery despite the 8.0 million pound cost associated with jockey Frankie Dettori's unique feat of winning all seven races at an Ascot race meeting last September.
On the casino side, the only disappointment was London's Maxims club, where George said there had been a reduction in high stake gambling and the company had made provisions for outstanding debt.
But a weaker performance from Ladbroke's casino division was more than offset by earnings in retail betting where trading profit rose to 59.8 million in 1996 from 34.1 million.
George said the company, which has decided to close down its property division, was still trying to dispose of two properties in the United States and one in Israel which should make a total gain of about 70 million pounds.
Net debt fell by 315.6 million to 707.7 million, reducing the interest charge by 25.8 million to 70.3 million. At its peak three years ago the company was crippled by debt of 1.6 billion pounds during a deep recession in the property market.
Exceptional items amounted to 103.8 million pounds included 52.3 million arising from the group's exit from commercial property and 15.4 million for the adjustment to the price of DIY retailer Texas Homecare sold to J. Sainsbury two years ago.

3001,"An army of financial market regulators were poised on Sunday to descend on NatWest Markets, the investment banking arm of National Westminster Bank, which on Friday announced a 50 million pound ($81.4 million) hole in its options trading book.
The Securities and Futures Authority, which licenses options traders, and the Bank of England, which regulates banks generally, both said they would be working closely together to establish what had gone wrong at NatWest Markets.
""Supervisors work closely together and there is no doubt that we will talking about what has happened at NatWest,"" a Bank of England spokesman told Reuters.
But the spokesman could not confirm a formal joint investigation with the SFA, reported in some newspapers on Sunday.
The Serious Fraud Office, which investigates large fraud cases in Britain said it was not yet involved.
""We are not investigating the case, it has not been referred to us and it's not appropriate to speculate about whether it will be, "" an SFO spokesman said on Sunday.
It also remained unclear on Sunday whether the operations of interest rate options trader, named by banking sources as Kyriacos Papouis, who now works for U.S. securities house Bear Stearns, included any element of fraudulent behaviour.
""At the moment, this looks like a trader trying to trade his way out of a loss,"" a banking source said, ""but it's not clear how or why, or how it took so long to discover.""
A spokeswoman for NatWest Markets said the deals had taken place over a period of time in 1996 and had come to light only in the last few days.
She confirmed the suspension of a senior options trader at NatWest Markets, named by sources as Neil Dodgson. A spokesman for Dodgson said he could not comment on the case but would be co-operating fully with any investigations.
The case is sure to raise again the question of supervision of derivatives trading, especially as all City firms went through an apparently exhaustive review of their risk management control systems in the wake of the Barings collapse in 1995.
Investment bank Barings collapsed under losses of 800 million pounds after rogue trader Nick Leeson embarked on a spree of unauthorised derivatives trading.
While the current case does not compare in terms of scale and does seem to have been nipped in the bud, it will still cause major waves around the City.
""We are making a very thorough review of our control systems -- both internal and external,"" the NatWest Markets spokeswoman said. ""This is a business that requires constant scrutiny, you can never be complacent about the control procedures.""
The question in the NatWest case is whether the ""mis-pricing"" of the options was done for personal gain or to hide the real position or was just hopelessly bad trading.
NatWest is also likely to face criticism in the coming days over the suspicion that it already knew of the loss when it announced its 1996 results last week.
NatWest has vigorously denied this, saying it brought the matter to light as soon as possible and has kept regulators fully informed.
NatWest also said no client has been affected. Some sources said Natwest should perhaps have said no client has been ""adversely affected"" since the 50 million pounds must be showing up as a gain in a trading book somewhere.

3006,"Financial services group Cater Allen said on Friday its purchase of Glasgow-based stockbroker Aitken Campbell from Union Plc would complement its existing activities in share dealing and stock lending.
""We already have a number of allied operations like City Deal and in Cater Allen we have a significant stock lending operation,"" Cater's managing director David White said in an interview.
White declined to divulge the price of Aitken Campbell but said the amount was not significant and that, while contracts remained to be signed, both sides had sought to reassure both the market and Aitken staff by making an announcement.
""Aitken fits in quite nicely with City Deal and will be a sister company, we're not merging it into anything,"" White added.
He also noted one of the attractions of Aitken Campbell was that it runs one of only four electronic trading systems in the market -- the others belong to BZW, Kleinwort Benson and Merrill Lynch.
Cater still maintains its discount house and other money market activities and has also moved into fund management.
Union announced on February 25 that it was at an advanced stage in talks to sell Aitken Campbell as part of a major reorganisation, which saw the historic firm give up its role as a money market counterparty to the Bank of England.
Union is thought to have received a bid approach for the rest of the company, mainly an asset play based on its banking licence and desirable headquarters building in the heart of the City, from millionaire Joe Lewis who already owns 24 percent of Union.
Caribbean-based Lewis recently hit the headlines by investing 40 million stg in football club Glasgow Rangers.
Acting executive chairman of Union, Graeme Knox was not available for comment on reports that Lewis's English National Investment Company is offering a 110p cash and shares deal for Union whose shares currently stand at 96p.

3007,"Britain's Woolwich Building Society, which will float on the stock exchange this summer, said on Wednesday its pretax profit rose by 18 percent to a record 392 million pounds ($629.5 million) in 1996.
Woolwich chief executive John Stewart said he wanted to see growth in all the company's businesses following its conversion into a listed company.
While its net mortgage lending jumped 50 percent to 1.4 billion pounds, the society said its administrative expenses rose by less than one percent and its cost-to-income ratio edged down to 45.8 percent from 48.9 percent.
Stewart said that if draft building societies legislation were passed in its current form, the Woolwich would have to consider expansion by acquisition very carefully.
This is because in its current form the law would take away a building society's five-year immunity from takeover if it takes over another financial sector company.
""If the bill is passed in its present form, it would make us think twice about acquisitions,"" Stewart said. ""We would have to weigh the strategic importance of the acquisition against the loss of protection.""
But Stewart added that, whatever the legislation, the Woolwich would be ""out there doing business"".
The Woolwich had an excellent record not only in organic growth but also in joint ventures and cold starts. ""We have a lot more clubs in our bag, there are a lot more ways to develop the business if we have to think twice about making an acquisition,"" he said.
The Woolwich, which will be quoted in the FTSE 100 index after flotation and is Britain's third largest building society, sees itself as a low-cost provider.
Stewart said he wanted costs to get even lower. ""We think we're efficient, we've got a track record of reducing our cost-to-income ratio and we're not finished, by no means,"" he said.
The Woolwich wanted to increase its business in areas such as unit trusts, life and general insurance and in the core mortgage business and personal loans.
He said he especially wanted to see growth in its French and Italian companies -- Banque Woolwich and Banca Woolwich -- which he said were already doing well.
Asked if Woolwich would grow organically in Europe, Stewart said, ""Oh no, it may well be by acquisition, if the right one comes along.""

3012,"Prudential Corp said on Tuesday its injection of funds into Scottish Amicable's life fund had probably clinched its bid for the mutually-owned life company, Prudential chief executive Sir Peter Davis told Reuters.
""Our offer used the strength of our balance sheet and the Prudential life fund,"" Davis said. ""We've put together an imaginative structure with the key difference being the capital injection or support we've offered of up to 1.3 billion stg to the (ScotAm) life fund.""  
Davis said the boost to ScotAm's fund -- the company will be run as a completely separate entity under the Prudential umbrella -- will mean that it will be able to have a more flexible investment policy which could include a greater proportion of investments in equities.
This in turn could raise returns.
The 1.3 billion stg investment comes from Prudential's life fund, which totals 51 billion stg, and will be provided to ScotAm at a commercial rate.
The merger, creating Scottish Amicable Life, is subject to the approval of policyholders at a special general meeting to be held in June. The proposals will be subject to a 75 percent vote in favour by eligible members.  
Davis said that on an embedded value or accruals basis, the merger would be earnings enhancing straight away but that on a modified accounting basis, which only takes account of profits on a new policy as bonuses start to be paid, the merger would be slightly dilutive for a couple of years.
The Prudential is paying 850 million stg from its shareholders' funds and its life fund. Coupled with the injection of up to 1.3 billion stg, this will allow the release of around 900 million stg over time from the ScotAm life fund to its policyholders.
Davis said ScotAm will develop more successfully with Prudential's capital backing and is expected to show a larger rate of growth.

3032,"London-based international bank HSBC Holdings Plc on Monday posted a 23 percent rise in 1996 profits but chief executive John Bond said it saw a challenging year ahead amid increasing competition.
Bond said HSBC, which gets 55 percent of its profits from the Asia-Pacific region, had a strong capital position and balance sheet, making it ready to meet that competition head-on.
""We see 1997 as a challenging year wherever we look whether it be Asia or the UK, the competition continues to increase,"" Bond said in an interview.
He also told a news conference that HSBC, one of the world's largest banking groups, wanted to make insurance an international core activity.
""We see the biggest growth potential in the Asia-Pacific region, we are already doing it in Hong Kong and we want to roll it out to other countries,"" Bond told reporters.
HSBC announced a 23 percent rise in pretax profits for 1996 to 4.52 billion pounds ($7.3 billion) -- around the middle of market expectations. A hefty nine pence per share rise in the annual dividend to 41 pence bettered most forecasts.
Bond said HSBC's British unit Midland Bank would continue to grow organically, as the price of acquisitions was impossible to justify to shareholders.
Midland, one of Britain's big four clearing banks, put in a strong performance with pretax profits up more than 20 percent and costs held to a rise of less than one percent, Bond said.
HSBC's capital ratios were strong with tier one capital rising to 9.9 percent from 9.5 percent at the end of 1995 and Bond said he did not see surplus capital being generated.
""As long as we're making a respectable return on capital, we regard capital strength as an asset in our business,"" Bond said. ""It helps you with the ratings, it helps with deposits in Asia and to have a strong capital position shows in the bottom line.""
HSBC had a 21.3 percent return on capital in 1996 compared with 20.7 percent in 1995.
Bond said HSBC continues to be confident over Hong Kong's transition from British to Chinese rule in July.
Last year, HSBC was granted a licence to trade in the Chinese yuan and Bond said the bank talking to the Chinese authorities to see how this would work.
HSBC was looking at this massive potential business opportunity in the long-term, he said.
""I think it will take time, of course it will, but the signs are all positive.""
Bond said the rise of sterling against the dollar had not had a great effect on the group's results in 1996 where the average rate for the pound against the dollar was below that of 1995.
He said that, very roughly, for every cent the pound goes up against the dollar, the bank loses 13 million pounds in profits.
Analysts said the results held few surprises and were not expecting to change their forecasts for 1997 in any major way.
Nick Collier of Morgan Stanley who expects 1997 pre-tax profits of 4.94 billion pounds said he might raise this estimate marginally. John Leonard of Salomon Brothers, who has been forecasting 4.87 billion pounds, sees a change of just 50 million pounds either way.

3035,"The Halifax Building Society, Britain's largest home loan lender, on Tuesday posted a 6.6 percent rise in pre-tax profits to 1.43 billion pounds ($2.3 billion) in 1996, the last time it will report before its stock market flotation in June.
The Halifax, which is expected to float for some 12 billion pounds after converting from mutual status, also hinted at further acquisitions to increase its 20 percent share of the total mortgage market.
Its chief executive Mike Blackburn told Reuters he saw some headroom before Britain's competition authorities became concerned.
""We do have some headroom before we would excite the attention of the OFT,"" Blackburn said in reference to competition watchdog the Office of Fair Trading. ""We have said to ourselves that we could certainly go to 25 percent (mortgage market share) before any anti-competitive issues arise.""
But Blackburn said in an interview the Halifax was not engaged in any acquisition discussions at the moment.
If more than 25 percent of a market is at stake in a proposed merger, British competition authorities usually investigate.
Blackburn said the Halifax was unlikely to want to add another mutually-owned life assurance company to its portfolio since the purchase of Clerical Medical last year had met its need for distribution of long-term savings products through Independent Financial Advisers (IFA).
Clerical Medical would be expanded and this explained the society's lack of interest in Scottish Amicable, an independent life insurer up for sale.
Blackburn said the Halifax would continue to target long-term savings products -- life assurance, pensions and investments -- for expansion because he believed they had strong growth potential.
""With an ageing population and governments unable to look after people as they have historically been able to do in retirement, the requirement on the private individual to provide for the long-term will be accentuated.""
The mortgage market had returned to a more normal position in the second half of 1996, he said, following the cut-throat competition of the first half from which the Halifax largely stood aloof.
There was now much less re-mortgaging and the number of transactions was seen rising by around 10 percent in 1997. House prices are set to rise around seven percent on average but more in some areas like London.
""We are seeing regional markets like London looking strong and this is leading to a repeat of the ripple effect we have seen historically,"" Blackburn added.
He said prices were being squeezed by the shortage of stock on the market with the Halifax's estate agencies reporting they could sell far more houses than were coming onto the market.
The Halifax, which saw total assets grow to more than 115 billion pounds in 1966 from just under 100 billion. It's gross mortgage lending was 11.5 billion pounds, but that represented a drop in market share to 16 percent from 17 the previous year.
Net mortgage lending stood at 2.1 billion pounds and mortgage balances grew to 81 billion pounds from 78 billion at the end of 1995.
Blackburn said any apprehension that the character of the Halifax would change after its conversion from a building society owned by its members into a publicly-owned bank was misplaced.
""Customers are our key focus and if we don't provide a competitive range of products then we won't be able to please shareholders, but we have to please customers first,"" he added.
The Halifax said its 1996 profits were before 502 million pounds of exceptional charges, made up of 298 million pounds in reorganisation costs and 153 million for the cost of converting into a public company which members approved last month. ($ = 0.619 British Pounds)

3039,"Banking analysts said on Friday that Lloyds TSB Group Plc's 52 percent headline rise in 1996 pretax profits was rather flattering and expressed some concern for future income growth.
The pretax profit figure of 2.505 billion stg was just above top expectations although these had been expected to be bettered after some components of the group -- Lloyds Abbey Life and Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester -- recently reported higher than expected gains.
""There's nothing really wrong with the results,"" said John Leonard, banking analyst at Salomon Brothers. ""But they are not as glorious as they look on the surface.""
Analysts pointed out that the large drop in bad debt provisions -- 44 percent down to 327 million stg -- was a surprise, even though improvement was expected given the fact that the bank has increased higher quality assets such as mortgages.
Leonard and Panmure Gordon analyst David Poutney said they would likely not be increasing their profit forcasts for 1997 which stand at 2.825 billion stg and 2.940 billion stg respectively.
But Poutney, who has been advising clients to hold the shares but take profits, said he was now a seller.
""Overall, they are good figures but then it comes down to the valuation of the shares,"" Poutney said, ""and they are looking a bit expensive. I can't see them making much headway from here.""
Lloyds TSB shares stood 5-1/2p lower at 496-1/2p at 0900 GMT.
Poutney expressed concern that costs, which were down in the first half, had ended the year virtually flat and also noted that income growth had slowed in the second six months.
All analysts pointed out that the 20 percent rise in the group's total dividend for 1996 to 13.2p per share was more than the market had been expecting with Lloyds continuing to pass value to shareholders via the dividend.
""Bad debts were much lower than expected,"" said Nick Collier, banking analyst at Morgan Stanley, ""and there was a bigger return from problem country debt.""
Specific provisons for bad and doubtful debts were down to 357 million stg from 459 million in 1995 while profit from its problem country debt portfolio, mainly in Latin America, jumped to 127 million stg from 50 million.
Lloyds said ""problem country debt"" had improved so much that it is renaming the portfolio ""emerging markets debt.""
Other concerns in the figures included a sharp rise in general insurance claims to 107 million stg from 70 million in 1995 although analysts were happy that the group has increased its provision against claims from the pensions mis-selling debacle by 39 million stg to 200 million.
Dealing profits were also sharply lower at 96 million stg compared to 175 million in 1985.
Despite their concerns, analysts were generally positive, though, given the shares' outperformance last year, they said this would now be difficult to maintain in 1996. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 8864.

3042,"Asia-Pacific specialist bank Standard Chartered Plc will boost investment in 1997 and beyond to take advantage of business opportunities, its chief executive Malcolm Williamson said on Wednesday.
""We're giving a signal that we do expect over the next year to increase costs because we're investing more in the business to really get it into good shape for the next millennium,"" Williamson told Reuters in an interview.
Williamson said he expects Standard Chartered's cost base to rise by seven percent in 1997 after a two percent rise in 1996.  
And Williamson added that the investment was likely to continue after 1997. ""It will go on for a period of years,"" he added.
""We need to step up that investment to give more power to our elbow.""
Williamson said that since quitting the businesses which Standard Chartered felt were not favourable in the long-term, the investment will be used to boost its core areas of operation.
He said these are retail banking, which provides around one third of the bank's profits, consumer banking, where credit cards are a burgeoning area and corporate and institutional banking.  
Earlier, Standard Chartered announced a 32 percent rise in pre-tax profits in 1996 to 870 million stg and raised its dividend the same amount to 14.5p per share for the year.
Williamson said the increased investment would not jeopardise the bank's progressive dividend policy.
Williamson said the Standard Chartered strategy does not include major acquisitions but added that in-fill buys could be a possibility.
He said major banking acquisitions in Asia were difficult for practical reasons such as legal constraints on foreign ownership. ""So, we're probably stuck with in-fill,"" he said.  
Williamson said economic prospects in the Asia-Pacific region were fairly bright, adding that both the Hong Kong and Chinese economies were doing well as the handover approaches.
He said that Standard Chartered did not expect the death of Deng Xiaoping or the handover of Hong Kong to China to disrupt the bank's business.
Williamson also pointed out that while some growth rates in Asia were not as strong as they have been, they were still stronger than anything seen in OECD countries.

Bond said HSBC was looking at this massive potential business opportunity in the long term.
""I think it will take time, of course it will, but the signs are all positive.""

3045,"Britain's markets watchdog banned former Barings treasury head Ian Hopkins on Tuesday from being a director in the City for at least three years for his part in the 1995 collapse of the investment bank.
In addition, the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA) ordered Hopkins to pay 10,000 pounds ($16,000) towards the SFA's costs after an independent tribunal found that he was no longer a ""fit and proper person"" to be a director of an SFA-regulated City firm.
Hopkins, one of nine Barings executives to have been disciplined by the SFA, has always protested that he attempted to ""blow the whistle"" on irregularities in the Singapore operation but that other managers ignored his warnings.
But this interpretation of his role was rejected by SFA chairman Nick Durlacher. ""The facts do not support this suggestion. An impartial tribunal has scrupulously considered all the available evidence and judged (he) did not 'blow the whistle' with any clarity, force or urgency,"" said Durlacher.
Hopkins was ultimately responsible at Barings Investment Bank for funding the group's international activities. He provided funds to Barings's futures operation in Singapore where trader Nick Leeson ran up losses of 800 million pounds after massive unauthorised trading which led to the collapse of the bank in February 1995.
Barings, its capital spent, was put under administration and later bought by Dutch financial services company Internationale Nederlanden Groep and now trades as ING Barings.
Durlacher added that the tribunal had found that Hopkins's actions ""fell far short of the standards expected of a prudent man in such a senior position"". Hopkins did not offer a formal defence against the allegations but the tribunal took into account written evidence from Hopkins and others.
The SFA announced the result of its last case against a Barings manager last month when it banned James Bax for 21 months and ordered him to pay costs of 10,000 pounds.
The penalty handed out to Hopkins was at the high end of the range of those imposed on former Barings managers after the tribunal found that he failed to control or reconcile funding to Singapore, acting without ""due skill, care and diligence"".
Following the collapse of Barings, the SFA started proceedings against nine former senior executives but did not proceed against Peter Baring and Andrew Tuckey, chairman and deputy chairman respectively of Barings group.
The nine were former chief executive Peter Norris, Ron Baker, Bax, Geoff Broadhust, Tony Gamby, Tony Hawes, Hopkins, George Maclean and Mary Walz. The tribunal has yet to hear an appeal by Baker against the reprimand he received.
Baring and Tuckey left Barings after giving assurances that they would never again seek top management jobs in the financial markets.
Britain's Department of Trade has started legal proceedings which could ban the Barings nine plus Tuckey from being directors of any British company for up to 15 years.
The DTI is to hold preliminary hearings and then would set a timetable for a final hearing of the cases.
Norris, Tuckey, Baker, Walz, Hopkins, Gamby, Broadhurst and Bax also face writs from accountancy firm Cooper's &amp; Lybrand in third party proceedings after it was sued by Barings administrator Ernst &amp; Young for what is thought to be around one billion pounds.

3046,"Prudential Corp Plc on Tuesday beat off rivals to win control of mutually-owned insurance group Scottish Amicable and reinforced its position as Britain's number one fund manager.
By beating bids from Abbey National Plc and Australian Mutual Provident (AMP), Prudential's takeover of ScotAm will raise its funds to more than 100 billion pounds ($160 billion).
Prudential shares rose as analysts saw the company as deriving strategic and earnings benefits from the deal. At 1315 GMT, Pru was up 17 pence at 557p. ""Pru has not gone crazy and paid a stupid price,"" said Michael Lindsay, analyst at Lehman Brothers. ""The acquisition looks to be earnings neutral in the first year and enhancing thereafter.""
ScotAm said with-profits policyholders would benefit from cash and additional policy benefits worth more than 1.5 billion pounds ($2.4 billion).
These include 600 million pounds from Prudential shareholders' and policyholders' funds in compensation for loss of membership rights and a special bonus from ScotAm's life fund worth 470 million pounds which will go into policies.
In addition, the entire remaining ScotAm life fund will be distributed, estimated to have a current value of 500 million pounds. On this basis, ScotAm with profits policy holders should receive total benefits of around 1,400 pounds, varying according to the size and age of the policy. Policyholders will also benefit from financial support to the tune of 1.3 billion pounds to boost ScotAm's life fund which will be closed.
ScotAm's original plan was to end its mutual status  and float on the stock exchange in two or three years time. But the plan was thrown into confusion after Abbey National made a bid for the firm last month.
The injection into the life fund had probably clinched its bid for the mutually-owned life company, Prudential chief executive Sir Peter Davis told Reuters. ""Our offer used the strength of our balance sheet and the Prudential life fund,"" Davis said in an interview. ""We've put together an imaginative structure with the key difference being the capital injection or support we've offered of up to 1.3 billion pounds to the (ScotAm) life fund.""
Davis said the boost to ScotAm's fund -- the company will be run as a completely separate entity under the Prudential umbrella -- will mean that it will be able to have a more flexible investment policy. This could include a greater proportion of investments in equities and higher returns.
The 1.3 billion pound investment comes from Prudential's life fund, which totals 51 billion pounds, and will be provided to ScotAm at a commercial rate.
The merger, creating Scottish Amicable Life, is subject to the approval of policyholders at a special general meeting to be held in June. The proposals will be subject to a 75 percent vote in favour by eligible members.
Davis said ScotAm will develop more successfully with Prudential's capital backing and is expected to show a larger rate of growth.
Roy Nicolson, managing director of ScotAm, told Reuters that the Prudential's offer of high up-front payments plus a reversionary bonus added to the capital support had swung the auction in Prudential's favour.
He said the new capital would allow greater investment in equities, providing the opportunity for better returns for policyholders in the future. Prudential's strong investment track record had also been a major factor.
""We're very excited about the business going forward,"" Nicolson said. ""We'll be able to expand our presence dramatically particularly in the IFA (independent financial adviser) market."" Nicolson said the deal would remove any doubt about ScotAm's financial strength. He said Prudential had pledged to maintain the number of jobs in the ScotAm head office for three years. Talks were already underway about the possibility of using the expertise in ScotAm's investment management arm in Prudential Portfolio managers. Nicolson said it was far too early to know if there would be job losses outside the head office ($ = 0.627 British Pounds)

3050,"Mercury Finance Co.'s woes deepened Friday when the company said it would be unable to pay $17 million in commercial debt due the same day, and its stock lost nearly 90 percent of its value.
The stock lost $13 to $1.875 on the New York Stock Exchange on volume of more than 27 million shares after it opened for trading Friday afternoon for the first time since Tuesday. It fell as low as $1.625.
Based on the more than 172 million shares outstanding as of early November, that would mean a loss of more than $2.2 billion in market capitalisaiton for the company.
On Wednesday, the company said it found problems in its bookkeeping that caused it to overstate earnings by $90 million over four years.
The consumer finance company said Friday that as a result of downgrades from several debt rating services, it would not be able to issue new short-term debt, known as commercial paper, to repay maturing debt and could not make the payments due Friday.
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. and Fitch Investors Service downgraded the company's commercial paper to a default rating.
Lake Forest, Ill.-based Mercury said it was in discussions with its lenders to satisfy its working capital needs, but could not predict the outcome of the discussions.
The company also said it had retained the services of Salomon Brothers Inc. to advise on its current and future capital needs, as well as all related issues.
Mercury said Wednesday it had to restate its earnings for the past four years by a total of about $90 million lower because of accounting irregularities.
Mercury said the problems appeared to stem from unauthorised entries in financial records by its controller, James Doyle.
But Doyle's lawyer reportedly accused Mercury of a charade and said Doyle was cooperating with federal authorities.
A special committee of Mercury's board, formed to investigate the accounting problems, has instructed its lawyers to contact Doyle's attorney, to attempt to reach Doyle and to obtain information on the investigation, Mercury said Friday.
Doyle's lawyer was out of town Friday and did not return repeated phone calls.
The company said it also directed its lawyers and accounting firm to expeditiously complete a thorough investigation of the auditing, accounting practices and procedures of the company and report to the board.
Another class-action lawsuit accusing the company of violating securities laws by issuing misleading and false financial statements was filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago. At least four such suits have been filed.

3055,"Huntington Bancshares Inc. said Monday it agreed to acquire First Michigan Bank Corp., a Michigan banking company, in a deal valued at $898 million.
The deal comes just months after Holland, Mich.-based First Michigan said it had been targeted by a different company. A First Michigan spokeswoman would not say who made the previous offer, or how it compared to the Huntington deal.
First Michigan shares fell 87.5 cents to $29.875 on Nasdaq at mid-afternoon, after having jumped to as high as $30.75 in recent weeks on takeover speculation.
Under the definitive agreement, Columbus, Ohio-based Huntington Bancshares will offer 1.05 shares of its stock for each First Michigan share in a fixed exchange that is expected to be a tax-free pooling of interests.
The deal originally was valued at $31.50 per share or $908 million, based on Friday's closing stock price for Huntington. Huntington stock, however, fell 50 cents to $29.50 on Nasdaq on Monday, lowering the value of the deal.
""It's an expensive price here,"" said Joseph Duwan, analyst at Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc. He noted that the deal valued First Michigan at 3.1 times book value and about 19 times 1996 earnings.
But First Michigan is also seen as a well-run franchise, in a western Michigan market that is attractive for its diverse economic base. Huntington is not currently in the western Michigan market, analysts noted.
""It's very pricey, but the point is I don't think anybody could have gotten First of Michigan without doing at least an at-market deal,"" said James Schutz, analyst at Chicago Corp.
All of First Michigan's 90 banking offices in the state will be merged into Huntington's lead subsidiary, Huntington National Bank. First Michigan has assets of $3.6 billion.
The combined company would have assets in excess of $25 billion, stockholders' equity of about $1.9 billion and a market capitalisation of about $5.2 billion.
""This merger significantly expands our Michigan market share and enables us to realise important synergies in our consumer, commercial and fee-based businesses,"" said Frank Wobst, chairman and chief executive of Huntington.
""Upon completion of this transaction, Huntington will have approximately $6 billion in assets in Michigan making it our second-largest market after Ohio.""
The acquisition is expected to boost Columbus, Ohio-based Huntington's earnings slightly in 1998 and increase profits by 4 percent in 1999, he said.
A pre-tax merger-related charge of about $35 million will be recognised in the quarter the merger is completed.
The merger is expected to result in annual cost savings of at least $19 million, or 15 percent of Michigan's expense base in 1998, by eliminating redundancy and excess capacity.
The deal is expected to close late in the third quarter, subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals.
Huntington has warrants to buy up to 19.9 percent of First Michigan's outstanding shares at an exercise price of $29.275 per share if the deal does not close under certain circumstances.
Huntington Bancshares, with assets in excess of $21 billion, operates 355 offices in Ohio, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan and West Virginia. It also has 81 mortgage, trust, investment banking, and automobile finance offices in those states as well as in Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, Pennsylvania and Virginia.

3063,"With Mercury Finance Co in talks to secure long-term financing and no fresh disclosures about the consumer finance company emerging, investors have started to come back to the stock.
""I think the stock is moving up because of time here,"" Michael Durante, senior specialty finance analyst at Prudential Securities, said on Wednesday. ""With each passing day, the company looks to be more and more stable.""  
No word has surfaced about any fresh adverse findings since Mercury appointed Arthur Andersen LLP as its auditor on February 18, Durante said, though the audit of 1996 results was still incomplete.
""I think indications are so far that nothing new has been found over and above what Peat Marwick found, which is good news,"" Durante said, referring to KPMG Peat Marwick, the company's former auditor.
A Mercury spokesman said the auditors declined to say exactly when they would finish their work.  
Meanwhile, Mercury this week has tried to secure long-term financing from lenders. The spokesman could not say how successful those talks have been.
On January 29, Mercury said accounting discrepancies were discovered, causing it to restate its results to show earnings over four years were $90 million less than previously reported.
Since then, Mercury has defaulted on millions of dollars of debt. It was served with a search warrant by FBI agents seeking financial records and hired a new chief executive officer. The company was also named as a defendant in more than half a dozen lawsuits related to the misstated earnings.  
The company lost more than $2 billion in market capitalization when its share price plunged after the disclosure of the erroneous financial information.
But in recent days, the stock has moved higher in active trading. After falling to as low as 1-1/2 on January 31 from 14-7/8 before the disclosures, Mercury was up 1/4 at 3-5/8 in early afternoon trading on Wedesday. More than 12 million shares changed hands.
Durante said the company had a liquidation value of $3-$4 a share, barring any new disclosures, while its value as a going concern was in the high single digits.
But other analysts were not as sanguine about Mercury's value. Katrina Blecher, an analyst at Gruntal &amp; Co, recommended investors sell at the stock's current level.
""On a fundamental basis, which is difficult at best to garner given the state of unaudited and/or unavailable specifics, we feel the company is fully valued,"" Blecher wrote in a research report Wednesday.

3071,"First Bank System Inc. said Thursday it will acquire U.S. Bancorp in a stock deal worth more than $8.5 billion that will make it the 14th-largest bank in the United States and give it a firm toehold in the Pacific Northwest.
The deal between Minneapolis-based First Bank and U.S. Bancorp, a regional bank based in Portland, Ore., will also result in the loss of about 4,000 jobs, the banks said.
Under a definitive agreement, U.S. Bancorp shareholders will receive in a tax-free exchange 0.755 share of First Bank common stock for each U.S. Bancorp share they own.
Based on First Bank's trading price of $75.375 Thursday, which was down $2.875, the purchase price equals $56.91 a share for holders of U.S. Bancorp, whose shares jumped $6.75 to $55.
""This is very rich pricing,"" said James Schutz at ABN AMRO Chicago Corp., noting the deal values U.S. Bancorp at about 19.2 times its 1996 earnings.
However, First Bank Chief Executive John Grundhofer's reputation for aggressive cost-cutting, the complementary fit of U.S. Bancorp with First Bank's mostly Midwestern markets and the rich price of bank stocks in general made the deal palatable to many analysts.
""You could live a couple of lifetimes without finding another fit this good,"" Grundhofer said in a statement announcing the deal.
""It's a natural fit for them,"" said Frank Barkocy, analyst at Josephthal, Lyon &amp; Ross. ""It's a natural extension of their marketplace.""
First Bank said it expected pretax cost savings of about $340 million from the merger, with combined operating expenses being reduced by 14 percent.
First Bank said it would take pretax charges of $625 million for costs related to the merger, which was expected to close by the end of June.
While it was too soon to say specifically which jobs would be cut in the merger, the majority of jobs affected will be in the Portland area, bank officials said. Both banks have instituted hiring freezes to help minimise the number of people losing jobs, the banks said.
First Bank said the deal was expected to add to its earnings per share starting in the second quarter of next year. By 1999, First Bank sees about an 8 percent addition to earnings per share.
First Bank said it would be able to increase revenues from the deal by offering its payment systems services to U.S. Bancorp's extensive corporate base.
Home equity lending and investment management services are also businesses First Bank plans to offer U.S. Bancorp's customers, while U.S. Bancorp's leasing expertise would be offered to First Bank customers, the banks said.
""Where the deal makes more sense is the compatibility of the business lines,"" said Stephen Biggar, analyst at S&amp;P Equity Group.
Grundhofer will be president and chief executive of the new company, which will take the U.S. Bancorp name but remain based in Minneapolis.
U.S. Bancorp Chairman Gerry Cameron will serve as chairman of the merged bank until his retirement in 1998.
Since 1991, First Bank has made 23 acquisitions, including the $717 million acquisition of Nebraska-based FirsTier Financial Inc. in 1996.
Cameron said he was first approached by Grundhofer about a deal in early November.
""I frankly told him he should go talk to someone else that was interested,"" Cameron told reporters during a conference call. But he said he felt a responsibility to shareholders to hear Grundhofer out and the two discussed the deal around Thanskgiving.
After subsequent meetings and a review that ended last weekend, both sides were even more convinced the deal made sense, he said.

3073,"Case Corp said Tuesday it plans to spend $950 million in the next four years as part of an ongoing program to revamp its product line by the turn of the century.
""We have the goal to replace all the major (agricultural) products by the end of the century,"" Jean-Pierre Rosso, chief executive of the Racine, Wisconsin-based farming and construction equipment maker said in an interview. Many construction products will also be revamped.  
One major portion of that product overhaul, a new tractor series, will enter production this spring, Rosso said.
The MX Series tractors, which run from 85 to 115 horsepower, are in the midsize area of the tractor market, which represent about 30 percent of tractor sales worldwide for Case, Rosso said.
Orders in the United States and Europe have already exceeded company plans, Rosso said, although he would not disclose what those plans were.
""We have significant orders on both sides of the ocean already,"" he said.  
The tractor, which was recently unveiled, will be produced in Racine and the United Kingdom.
The switch from the German production site of Case's mid-sized tractors is expected to lower costs both from a labor and logistics stand point, Case said. The Racine and UK plants are also more efficient than the German plant. The new design utilizes more common components for models in different parts of the world, also bringing down costs, Case said.
Typically, the U.S. market has larger farms and looks for more horsepower, with wider implements. European farmers are looking for more advanced features on lower horsepower tractors, Rosso said.  
""The new design is much better matched to the needs and requirements of the customer base that it is targeted to,"" said J. Blair Brumley, analyst at Dain Bosworth Inc. The pricing of the tractor will also be equivalent to products offered by competitor Deere &amp; Co, Brumley said.
The switch to the MX series tractors is expected to depress earnings in the first quarter, before boosting earnings later in the year, Case and analysts have said.
At the same time, Case is also introducing a premium tractor called the QuadTrak, which has also been well received.  
""There's more demand than we can supply this year,"" Rosso said of the QuadTrak, which is designed with four tracks to have better terrain handling and less soil compaction.
In the early phases of the QuadTrak introduction, Case will lease about half of those tractors in order to get more customer feedback, Rosso said.
Also this year, Case plans to introduce a new skid steer loader, a piece of construction equipment that can utilize many different attachments -- sort of the construction equivalent of a Swiss Army knife. The loader will be at the higher-margin heavy lift end of the product line, Rosso said.
""It gets us in a part of the market which we are not present,"" Rosso said.
Adding a new product to its skid steer line could help Case to face new competition in the market, Brumley said.
""They're number two in market share and that skid steer market is going to get real crowded,"" with offerings from other manufacturers, Brumley said.

3081,"FBI agents Monday searched the headquarters of troubled Mercury Finance Co., which announced a change in its leadership days after announcing bookkeeping problems that caused it to overstate its earnings by millions of dollars.
The used-auto loan company named turnaround and bankruptcy specialist William Brandt Jr. president and chief executive officer. Brandt replaces John Brincat, who resigned those positions but will remain as an employee and a member of the board of directors, Mercury said.
The FBI agents, armed with a search warrant, arrived late Monday morning at Mercury's headquarters in the Chicago suburb of Lake Forest, Ill., seeking financial records, a company spokeswoman said.
Mercury said in a statement that it was cooperating fully with the investigators in supplying documents requested under the search warrant.
""We are grateful the FBI is conducting the search in a way that is not disruptive to business,"" the spokeswoman said.
The company announced Wednesday that it had found problems in its bookkeeping that caused it to overstate earnings by $90 million over four years. The company said the misstatements appeared to stem from unauthorised entries in financial records by its former controller, James Doyle, whom the company said it dismissed.
But Doyle's lawyer reportedly accused Mercury of a ""charade"" regarding the faulty books and said his client was cooperating with federal authorities.
Brandt, president and chief executive officer of Chicago-based Development Specialists Inc., takes over as Mercury continues to negotiate with lenders after defaulting on $17 million in commercial debt Friday. Analysts said Mercury has as much as $100 million in debt due this week.
In a statement, Brandt said, ""My experience with turnarounds is that the first stage is critical and requires enormous focus, coordination and immediate information-gathering to identify the most effective way to return a company like Mercury Finance to financial stability.""
One person familiar with Brandt's reputation said the appointment could help forestall a bankruptcy filing by Mercury.
""I think with the announcement of this guy as head, he will buy them some time ... to do some negotiating with creditors,"" said James Schrager, senior lecturer in business policy at the University of Chicago.
Schrager described Brandt's reputation as ""Mr. Clean. Knows the rules for bankruptcy, which are the relevant rules here.""
A Mercury spokeswoman stressed that while Brandt is a bankruptcy expert, he also has experience with corporate turnarounds that did not involve bankruptcy.
But, while conceding that the hiring of an outsider might buy Mercury a little more time with its lenders, one attorney with experience in bankruptcy cases said it was disappointing that Mercury did not say it secured bank financing this weekend.
""Unless they get the bank support, there's no way they're going to be able to restructure"" the short-term debt coming due, said Ted Koenig, a partner with Holleb &amp; Coff in Chicago.
Mercury, whose stock lost about 86 percent of its value last week after it announced it was forced to restate its 1996 earnings due to the accounting irregularities, also was meeting its lenders in Chicago on Monday to discuss financing arrangements to meet its liquidity needs.
The stock continued slipping Monday, dipping 25 cents to $1.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.

3086,"Sears, Roebuck and Co will spend more than $500 million to revamp and expand its off-the-mall tire and battery stores under the new National Tire and Battery name, the retailer said Wednesday.
The change is part of a plan under which Sears will spend more than $1 billion through the year 2002 on its entire auto group to add stores and convert some existing stores.  
Hoffman Estates, Ill.-based Sears, which sold 25 million tires and 8.5 million batteries through its Sears Tire Group in 1996, will combine most of its 275 Tire America and National Tire Warehouse Stores under the National Tire and Battery name, Sears said.
The company also plans to add about 100 National Tire stores over the next five years, hoping to add about $120 million in annual revenue for the tire group when the expansion is completed. Sears' tire group had $2.3 billion in revenues in 1996.  
The stores, unveiled Wednesday in Chicago, will have a high-tech, open feel, with customers able to watch the work being done on their cars. Pricing will be competitive in individual markets, Sears said.
""We will be at market pricing in every market we're in,"" Paul Baffico, president of Sears Automotive Group, said in an interview. ""We do not necessarily want to be the market price leader, but we will be competitive with anybody who is in the market.""  
The off-the-mall stores are geared toward a younger, higher income customer with higher performance car needs than the 800 mall-based Sears Auto Centers, Baffico said. Because of the existence of the mall stores, the retailer chose not to include the Sears name in National Tire and Battery.
""From a location strategy standpoint, a different name allows us to be closer to a Sears store without cannibalizing the market,"" Baffico said.
Areas targeted for new tire stores this year are Detroit, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Rochester, N.Y. and Buffalo, N.Y.  
Sears will also add a small number of Sears Auto Center stores in malls where they have recently acquired other retailers, Baffico said.
Separately, Sears plans to spend more than $650 million to add 780 Parts America auto parts stores by the year 2002 and to transform 240 Western Auto stores to Parts America, Baffico said.  
""We should be by 2002 the clear number two in parts,"" Baffico said. That category is currently led by Memphis, Tenn.-based AutoZone Inc, with Pep Boys -- Manny, Moe &amp; Jack of Philadelphia second, based on revenues. Sears' parts group had $1.4 billion in revenue in 1996.
Since the parts stores do not compete with Sears' mall format, the company will decide by the end of the summer whether to include the Sears name in the name of the stores, Baffico said.
One analyst agreed that Sears' expansion plans for the automotive group were aggressive, but noted that the company was being even more aggressive in other formats.
""Those are relatively aggressive, but remember they're coming from a place where they've been a little stagnant for a while,"" Stephen Latz, analyst at A.G. Edwards, said of the auto group expansion plans.

3087,"Caterpillar Inc. reported a first quarter profit of $394 million Tuesday, the best quarter in the company's history and up 33 percent from a year ago.
Caterpillar also said it now expects 1997 profits will be higher than the $1.4 billion it posted in 1996, based on expectations for ""moderately higher"" sales.
The outlook is a switch from January, when Caterpillar forecast profits near 1996 levels.
The Peoria, Ill.-based heavy equipment maker reported earnings of $394 million, or $2.08 a share, well above the Wall Street consensus of $1.69 a share. Sales and revenues were $4.26 billion.
A year earlier, Caterpillar earned $296 million, or $1.53 a share, on revenues of $3.84 billion.
""This is just a very, very solid operating quarter,"" J. Blair Brumley, an analyst who follows Caterpillar at Dain Bbosworth Inc., said.
Gross profit margins helped drive earnings in the quarter, rising to 26.8 percent of machinery and engine sales from 24.5 percent a year ago.
The rise in profit margins was primarily due to higher prices, higher physical sales volume, a favourable change in geographic sales mix, lower sales discounts and the net effect of the stronger dollar.
But the favourable effect of the stronger dollar on costs incurred in Japanese yen and European currencies was substantially offset by the negative impact on prices.
Sales inside the United States were $2.17 billion, up 15 percent from a year ago. Sales outside the United States were $1.90 billion, up 6 percent from a year ago.
Sales volume in the quarter was up 9 percent, while prices improved 2 percent, Caterpillar said.
While results were far better than expected for the quarter, analysts expressed some concern about how much the stronger dollar aided results.
Caterpillar also hedged its forecast for the year, saying greater-than-expected interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve and lingering weakness in European demand could hurt results.
Also, if the dollar remains too strong vs. the yen, the company could be forced to cut prices because of competition from Japanese companies, Caterpillar said.
Caterpillar noted that the economic and industry outlook improved from January because the United States and Canada are now expected to have better economic growth and higher machine industry demand than originally anticipated.
The company said it expected U.S. gross domestic product to rise 3 percent in 1997, up from the 2 percent it expected earlier. Caterpillar shares rose $2.25 to $81.625 Tuesday.

3092,"Shares of Sears, Roebuck and Co, the nation's second largest retailer, fell about six percent Thursday after the company said it will voluntarily refund some payments from credit card holders who filed for bankruptcy.
Sears said the repayments might have a material effect on 1997 earnings. But analysts said the company could not quantify its earnings exposure during a conference call.
Sears stock was down 3-1/8 to 47-3/4.  
The dispute is over a process called reaffirmations, where Sears approaches holders of Sears credit cards who have filed for bankruptcy and attempts to have them make payment to Sears rather than having the debt and their Sears credit wiped out in bankruptcy court.
The reaffirmation agreements must be filed with a bankruptcy court. Sears said Thursday some of the agreements were not filed properly.
While Sears could not say how much it might have to refund to debtors, the company did say it had $400 million in reaffirmations from 1992 through February 1997, analysts said.  
Analysts noted that some of the reaffirmations were properly filed. But Sears may also be subject to other court sanctions.
The retailer told analysts it would offer each debtor affected a $100 gift certificate.
A Sears spokeswoman was not immediately available to confirm analysts' comments.
""It (the earnings impact) could end up being $0.50 to $1.00 a share and that's a lot,"" said Peter Schaeffer, analyst at Dillon, Read.  
Analysts also said that Sears defined ""material"" as anything over five percent of annual net income. Based on analysts estimates for 1997 earnings, that could mean a minimum cost of about $70 million to 1997 earnings, analysts said.
But analysts also said it was too early to say how much impact the credit card problem would have.
""They (Sears officials) don't know,"" said Karen Sack, analyst at S &amp; P Equity Group. ""They can't quantify it until they do a full investigation.""
The company also said same store sales rose one percent in March, slightly below expectations.
But the credit card problem was what was hurting the stock, analysts said.

Overall, he expects comparable-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, to be up about 5 percent or slightly less.
An early Easter could depress sales at stores that were closed on the holiday, which fell in the March selling period instead of April this year. Winter storms in much of the northern part of the nation may have also held sales back.
""You need to look at March and April overall to get comparable sales,"" William Armstrong, an analyst at Fahnestock &amp; Co. Inc. said of quirks in the reporting calendar, where some retailers include Easter in March and others in April this year.
Armstrong is expecting overall retail sales for March to increase by 2 percent to 4 percent.
Most retailers will report March sales early Thursday. But Plano, Tex.-based J.C. Penney Co. Inc. Tuesday reported a 3.7 percent decline in comparable-store sales at its JCPenney stores in March. The early report was due to a debt offering the company is making this week.
The loss of one day's sales because of Easter hurt sales, J.C. Penney said.
Penney's decline is expected to be mirrored by other department stores, analysts said.
""Most (department store) chains saw flat or even slightly lower comparable sales during the March period, as they compared with healthy year-ago increases,"" analysts at Montgomery Securities wrote in a research report. They added that the early Easter and snowstorms in the Northeast added to pressure on sales.
At the same time, discount stores are expected to post 4 percent to 6 percent sales gains, with low-end discounters reporting low double-digit gains, Montgomery said.
""We continue to believe the low-end strata is benefitting from the fruits of a fully-employed economy and the direct pay-hike from the 1996 minimum wage increase,"" Montgomery's analysts wrote.
Among the major chains, analysts see Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's largest retailer, reporting same-store sales gains of about 7 percent. Sears, Roebuck and Co. was expected to report gains of 2 percent to 3 percent, with Kmart Corp. up 10 percent to 12 percent.
Kmart's results are expected to be driven by seasonal items, such as horticulture, home goods and bicycles. But it will give back some of those gains in April because of the calendar shift, analysts at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell said in a research note. Kmart stores were open on Easter, analysts added.
Dayton Hudson Corp. is expected to post a 1 percent to 2 percent gain, with a 3 percent to 4 percent increase at its Target discount stores offsetting flat department store sales. Federated Department Stores Inc. is expected to post flat sales, with some planned promotions moved into April, analysts said.

3102,"The world's biggest miner, RTZ-CRA, announced a major realignment of its sprawling empire on Wednesday and removed any doubt that London was its capital.
The group, born of a 1995 merger of London-based RTZ Plc and Australian-based CRA Ltd, said it would now manage its global businesses along six main product lines.
These were aluminium, copper, energy, industrial minerals, iron ore, and gold and other minerals. Together they reaped revenues of around US$8 billion for the group in calendar 1996 from operations on all six continents.
RTZ-CRA said it would shrink its Melbourne office, CRA's home base and until now the group's ""other"" headquarters. It will halve the staff there, shedding 100 jobs, and leave the office with a support role only. A total of 200 jobs will go worldwide.
The announcement provoked an angry response in parts of the Australian press. One newspaper said that CRA had been ""buried under the RTZ shake-up"".
CRA chairman John Uhrig said that the merger, which maintained the two firms' separate listings, had so far not produced a better outcome for shareholders.
""It would have been surprising if it had in its first year of operation,"" Uhrig told a news conference in Melbourne.
In London, RTZ-CRA executive chairman Robert Wilson told reporters the group would take a one-off restructuring charge of US$40 million this year, and expected to gain annual cost savings of $50 million to $60 million by 1998.
The reorganisation leaves Australian-based executives to manage the aluminium, energy and iron ore businesses from Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth. London handles the rest and remains the sole group headquarters.
The Salt Lake City office of its Kennecott copper operation in the United States as well as the group's Johannesburg office would be closed, the company said.
The new structure shifts the focus of management away from a geographical view of the world, where operations differ by country, toward a single management for each global business.
It ensures RTZ-CRA does not become an unwieldy bureaucracy unable to compete with more nimble rivals which deal in just one commodity, the group said.
""RTZ-CRA is a big company by the standards of the industry,"" executive chairman Wilson said. ""We are striving to obtain benefits of scale without the bureaucracy that goes very often with size.""
Chief executive Leon Davis gave examples where, under the current structure, copper operations and coal mines were under several different leaderships across the globe.
""These are barriers that are artificially created and we are intent on removing them,"" Davis told the news conference.
""It will eliminate duplication, lower our costs and improve our efficiency,"" he added.
Mining analysts welcomed the move. One viewed it as confirmation the RTZ-CRA marriage, made without any shares actually changing hands, was effectively a cheap buy-out of CRA.
""If anyone thought the DLC (dual-listed structure) was anything other than a buy-out on the cheap, they should assess this little move because they are virtually wiping out Melbourne head office,"" a Sydney-based analyst told Reuters.
The analyst said he expected the group to eventually transform the dual-listed structure into the one company, although in London Wilson denied that the changes would undermine the dual-structure.
RTZ-CRA has already proposed to ditch its double-barrelled name and become known, subject to shareholder approval this year, as Rio Tinto. RTZ's shares would then trade in London as Rio Tinto Plc and CRA's stock in Australia as Rio Tinto Ltd.
A Melbourne-based analyst said the cementing of London as the group's headquarters came as no surprise. ""It doesn't make any sense to have two head offices,"" he said.

3104,"Australian industrial conglomerate Pacific Dunlop Ltd has dived into red ink in an effort to put two years of ""sobering"" financial woes behind it, declaring on Friday a full-year loss of A$132 million.
The group's earnings for the year to June 30 included a net abnormal loss of A$296 million, reflecting management's decision to cast off its troubled U.S. medical equipment unit and book over A$80 million in restructuring charges and asset writedowns.  
""This is a clean-out result and it gives both myself and my managenent team an absolutely clean slate on which to write the next chapter of Pacific Dunlop's history,"" group managing director Rod Chadwick said in announcing the result.
Pacific Dunlop's recent history has been dominated by severe problems faced by its Telectronics subsidiary, which is now up for sale after a defect in one of its cardiac-implant products effectively put the unit out of business for 13 months.
""We have so far had six deaths from this problem over the last two years,"" Chairman John Gough told reporters.  
The problem was first detected in Telectronics Accufix pacemaker lead in late 1994.
Telectronics' losses accounted for A$340 million of gross abnormal losses, including a provision of A$91 million for the expected loss on the eventual sale of the business.
""We are in very advanced negotiations,"" said Gough, who called the problem with the pacemaker leads ""in many ways ... an act of God"" and unforeseeable.

3107,"The world's biggest miner, RTZ-CRA, said on Wednesday it needed to polish its public image after it came under attack for the second time in as many weeks.
A fortnight after protesters swarmed on the group's London annual meeting, Australian trade unionists and conservationists infiltrated a shareholders' meeting in Melbourne, criticising its record on human rights, labour and environmental issues.  
RTZ-CRA's Australian chairman, John Uhrig, and some of the protesters, speaking as Australian shareholders or their proxy, engaged at times in shouting matches inside the meeting hall.
Trade unionists from Australia's coal and iron ore industries accused RTZ-CRA of intimidating workers, while others claimed it refused to stand up against human rights abuses.
Uhrig strongly denied the accusations and appeared to feel protesters were hijacking the meeting, insisting other shareholders be allowed to speak.
He finally called on a vote to have the meeting closed.  
But later, speaking to reporters, he said work needed to be done to improve the group's public image. ""In the general community, I am sure we have a job to do,"" Uhrig said.
The company needs to do more work in Australia to improve its public image than probably elsewhere in the world, because the group enjoys such a high profile here, he added.
He referred in particular to RTZ-CRA's labour relations.
""The general public really does not understand what we have done and maybe that needs to be explained,"" Uhrig said.

3113,"The consortium believed to be the winning bidder for Australia's Loy Yang A power station has minimised the U.S. dollar-component of the A$4.75 billion deal to about US$500 million, a corporate source said on Tuesday.
""There's no massive splash from a foreign exchange point of view,"" the source, who is close to the bidding, told Reuters.
The consortium said to have won the bidding comprises U.S. utilities CMS Energy Corp, with about 50 percent, and NRG Energy Inc and Horizon Energy Investments Ltd, each with about 25 percent.  
Local currency dealers said they thought about A$400 million to A$500 million cover had been taken on Monday ahead of the deal's announcement, which is likely at about midday.
Horizon is a vehicle for Australian institutions led by Macquarie Bank's Infrastructure Trust of Australia Group Ltd.
The consortium's capital structure is designed around a high gearing ratio of around 75 percent, with bank debt, indexed bonds and subordinated debt accounting for almost A$3.6 billion of the A$4.75 billion bid, sources said.  
All of the debt and a quarter of the equity component will be raised in Australia, leaving the balance of the equity to be funded offshore, the Melbourne source said.
""There's no big tranche of offshore dollars greater than what was done in the past for Yallorn and Hazelwood,"" he said.
The Victoria state government's earlier sale of its Yallorn and Hazelwood power stations involved around US$500 million in foreign equity, the source said.
The Loy Yang A consoritum's foreign exposure was already covered, he added.  
""We have mitigated already but, given the capital structure of the deal, there is a negligible impact from a foreign exchange point of view,"" the source said.

3114,"Australia's Woodside Petroleum Ltd on Wednesday announced it would ramp up exploration spending this year as it sought to diversify away from the lucrative gas fields of the North West Shelf.
Woodside unveiled its aggressive exploration programme for calendar 1997, much of its centred outside the offshore North West Shelf fields, after reporting a 58 percent surge in annual net earnings to A$191 million for 1996.
Woodside's shares shot up on the profit announcement, which was in line with market expectations.  
The stock closed at the day's high of A$8.97 on Wednesday, up 31 cents on Tuesday's close, confirming the market's bright view of Woodside.
Woodside said it would more than double exploration spending in 1997 to a record A$120 million with over half of this being thrown at the company's interests in the Timor Sea.
""Certainly this is an order-of-magnitude increase in non-North West Shelf exploration activity,"" Akehurst told a news conference in Melbourne.
Woodside plans to drill 12 to 14 exploration wells, including eight or nine outside the North West Shelf, he added.  
Akehurst also announced in North West Shelf's proven reserves, with ultimate gas recovery leaping 60 percent to 24.4 trillion cubic feet (tcf) at the end of 1996.
Oil reserves rose 11 percent to 175 million barrels and condensate reserves were up 21 percent to 690 million barrels.
Woodside expressed confidence the North West Shelf would meet the 30 tcf in gas reserves needed to justify a doubling of LNG capacity to meet growing demand from Japanese customers.
""Quite clearly we see considerable upside...,"" Akehurst said, citing estimated possible reserves of 45 tcf.  
Equal partners in the North West Shelf are Woodside, The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd, The British Petroleum Co Plc, Japan Australia LNG (MiMi) Pty Ltd, a partnership of Mitsui &amp; Co Ltd and Mitsubishi Corp, Chevron Corp and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group.
The six partners plan to double annual LNG production to 14 million tonnes by 2003 at a capital cost of A$6 billion.
The North West Shelf partners and owners of the nearby Gorgon gas field have been discussing the prospects of merging the two developments, with a view to expanding the North West Shelf's existing LNG plant further.  
""I think the exciting prospect is to see how we can move on from there and look for opportunities with third parties to expand that project,"" Akehurst said.
He said he would welcome any proposal to merge Gorgon with North West Shelf production ""to cooperate on a sixth and seventh train"". Currently, the North West Shelf partners plan to expand their Burrup Pensinsula plant to five trains.
Chevron, Texaco Inc and Shell each hold two-seventh stakes in Gorgon, with Mobil Corp owning one-seventh.

3123,"Australian paper and packing group Amcor Ltd is expected on Thursday to report a sharp fall in half-year profit after a tumble in world paper prices.
Stock analysts have on average forecast the company to post a net profit before abnormals of about A$145 million for the six months ended December 31, a fund manager told Reuters.
The average forecast compares with a result of A$213.5 million for the same period a year earlier, when paper prices soared, but is broadly in line with the previous half-year.  
""In the second half of last year (1995/96), they made A$142 million and really that's what people are looking for,"" a Sydney-based analyst told Reuters.
Paper prices, which impact heavily on Amcor's earnings, touched historic highs towards late calendar 1995 but came back to earth last year.
""Paper prices have probably fallen on average by around 25 to 30 percent,"" Macquarie Equities analyst Philip King said.
""They probably hit their bottom in the June quarter of 1996 and since then they have been pretty flat,"" he told Reuters.  
Sluggish economic growth at home and abroad as well as stiff competition in Amcor's packaging businesses in Australia and New Zealand also kept a lid on half-year earnings, analysts said.
The group's container packaging and fibre packaging divisions accounted for over half of Amcor's earnings before interest and tax in 1995/96. Both would report a slight fall in earnings for the half-year, against a year ago, analysts said.
Amcor's loss-making Holfelder fibre-packaging business in Germany was again expected to detract from the group's half-year result, they said.  
Amcor had begun a cost-cutting drive at the German box-maker and says it would approach break-even in 1996/97.
But the paper division would shoulder most of the expected fall in half-year earnings, analysts said.
Its profit could be roughly half the A$173 million it earned before interest and tax in the first half-year of 1995/96, the fund manager said.
The silver lining in Amcor's result should be its outlook, which analysts described as positive.  
Domestic and world economic growth was set to underpin stronger earnings in 1997/98, with some signs of improvement evident already, they said.
One analyst warned of a risk that paper price would show renewed weakness, but others saw prices firming and margins fattening in the packaging businesses in 1997/98.
""For some significant improvement you have to look at '98...,"" the Sydney analyst said.

3125,"Bougainville's secessionist rebel leader Francis Ona said he feared his mountainous, jungle-clad South Pacific island would be destroyed by mining if it failed to win independence from Papua New Guinea.
Ona, political leader of the rebels, said in a rare interview aired on Australian radio on Tuesday he believed Papua New Guinea would allow the remote, resource-rich island to be plundered by foreign miners.
""Bougainville seems to be on top of a big mineral resource. We truly believe that all the island of Bougainville is under threat of destruction by these foreign companies,"" Ona told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
Papua New Guinea on Sunday announced it wanted to buy back the foreign interest in Bougainville's giant Panguna copper mine, closed in 1989 after sabotage attacks by rebels.
Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan said the buy-back scheme would result in a financial compensation package for landowners and, along with the hiring of mercenaries, was aimed at ending the nine-year rebellion.
Development of the mine fuelled secessionist sentiment among Bougainvilleans who felt they were not sharing in its wealth.
The mine, which opened in 1972, swelled the Papua New Guinea government's coffers by producing 160,000 tonnes of copper concentrate annually, increasing local resentment on the island. The mine also produced copper and silver.
Ona, president of the rebels' self-declared Bougainville Interim Government, said the Panguna mine would be restarted and four other mines approved if the independence struggle failed.
He named four other areas he said were ripe for mining, including Buka, a small island a short canoe ride to the north of Bougainville where Papua New Guinea troops are based.
""Without independence Papua New Guinea is going to enforce those five mines on Bougainville,"" Ona said.
Chan has said he wants to buy control of the Panguna mine from global mining group RTZ-CRA, which owns 53.6 percent of the mine operator Bougainville Copper Ltd.
Mining analysts have said it would take three to four years to restart the Panguna mine and that a political solution was essential for any mining activity on Bougainville.
Ona and other rebel leaders were targetted for capture in mid-1996 when the Papua New Guinea government launched an offensive to snatch control of rebel-held areas on the island.
Since the demise of ""Operation High Speed"", Papua New Guinea has hired a British-based supplier of mercenaries, Sandline International, to train troops for a mission to Bougainville.
The presence of 40 mercenaries now in Papua New Guinea has attracted strong criticism from Australia, New Zealand, Britain, the United States and South Africa.
The Bougainville conflict has claimed hundreds of lives since sporadic guerrilla warfare first broke out on the island in 1988, and has attracted charges of human rights abuses by both troops and rebels.

3128,"Australia's powerful Maritime Union launched rolling bans on Indonesian shipping on Wednesday to protest against the arrest of Indonesian labour leaders and Canberra's ""failure"" to press Jakarta on human rights.
The lightning bans, called at short notice and designed to hold up ships for 24 hours, could apply on an irregular basis to all types of commodity exports to Indonesia, the union said.
Jakarta said the union's move could hurt bilateral ties.
""Such kind of incidents are regretted and will harm the efforts to build up relations between the two countries,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Ghaffar Fadyl said in Jakarta.
""Probably this kind of thing will have the strongest reaction from the business sector who are most affected,"" Fadyl told Reuters. He declined to comment further.
Indonesia, Australia's nearest Asian neighbour, bought A$2.4 billion (US$1.9 billion) worth of Australian commodities in 1995, covering grains, minerals, livestock and refined petroleum.
""The bans are to protest against the recent arrests of independent labour leaders Muchtar Pakpahan and Dita Sari and the continuing repression following the July riots in Jakarta,"" the union said in a statement.
The bans were also a response to Australian Prime Minister John Howard's failure in Jakarta this week to press Indonesia on the issue of human rights and democracy, the union said.
During his visit to Indonesia, Howard reaffirmed Australia's commitment to close ties.
The first ship to be hit by the rolling bans will be the Bogasari Empat, due to arrive in Fremantle on Australia's west coast late on Wednesday to load 32,500 tonnes of wheat.
The ship will load wheat as scheduled but will be delayed for 24 hours before being able to depart, union assistant secretary Vic Slater told Reuters.
""It delays things,"" Slater said of the bans. ""In terms of the economy, I don't think it has any effect on the Australian economy.""
Pakpahan, leader of the Indonesian Labour Welfare Union (SBSI), has been charged with subversion in connection with riots that rocked the Indonesian capital on July 27. The crime of subversion is punishable by death.
Five people died and 149 were injured in the Jakarta riots, Indonesia's official Human Rights Commission has said. Scores of buildings were set ablaze in the unrest, which was the worst in Jakarta since anti-Japanese riots there in 1974.
The riots followed a police raid on the headquarters of the minority Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) to evict supporters of Megawati Sukarnoputri, who had been ousted as party leader by a government-backed faction the previous month.
Labour activist Dita Sari was arrested before the July 27 riots over a labour strike in Surabaya, media reports have said.
The Australian rolling bans are in line with a world-wide campaign against Pakpahan's arrest by the International Transport Workers' Federation, which represents more than five million workers in 120 countries, the Maritime Union said.
""Muchtar Pakpahan is an independent and moderate union leader who has even won the respect of the U.S. embassy (in Jakarta),"" Slater said.
U.S. Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Winston Lord met Pakpahan in his Jakarta cell last Friday.
The Maritime Union has 10,000 members working around Australia as seamen and waterside workers.

3136,"Australia's car-makers face massive disruption from next week due to a prolonged strike at a steel plant supplying the industry, car-makers said on Tuesday.
The four major manufacturers -- Ford, Toyota, General Motors Holden and Mitsubishi Motors -- have warned production will be shut down if the strike drags on.
The strike, in its fourth week, has crippled industrial group Email Ltd's Martin Bright Steel factory in Melbourne. The plant is the sole supplier to TRW Steering and Suspension Australia Ltd, which makes power steering units.  
The subsidiary of U.S. car-parts giant TRW Inc is a monopoly supplier to local car-makers, an industry source said.
The Australian Manufacturing Workers Union (AMWU), which wants a 15 percent wage rise over two years for the Martin Bright Steel workers, said on Tuesday the strike could escalate.
The 130 striking workers at Martin Bright Steel have been picketing the factory since April 11, preventing Email from moving stock out to its customers, an AMWU official said.
""We are talking about a major escalation of the dispute if they try to break that picket,"" AMWU organiser Craig Johnston told Reuters.  
""I think you will see a reaction that not even the employers are counting on,"" he added.
A spokesman for Email was not immediately available.
In letters sent last week to Australia's Industrial Relations Commission, car-makers said they would be forced to halt production and stand down thousands of workers from this week if the strike was not resolved quickly.
But on Tuesday, Ford, Toyota and Mitsubishi said they could now maintain full production for at least another week, but perhaps for not for much longer.  
""We are still going and expect to be until at least Friday week (May 16),"" said Ford Australia's public affairs general manager, Wendy Perkins.
""Obviously if supply of anything dried up, we would not be able to keep producing. We are keeping a watching brief.""
Toyota and Mitsubishi spokesmen told Reuters production was guaranteed for at least ""this week"".
TRW Steering and Suspension managing director Michael Laufer declined to comment on Tuesday, but an industry source said the firm could only keep going for another two weeks.  
TRW has kept car-makers supplied over the past three weeks by finding a contractor to make substitute parts for the power steering units, but this is a stop-gap measure, the source said.
""The automotive companies have gone along with the substitution ... but it's different material and they would prefer us to go back to the Martin Bright specifications,"" he said.
The Martin Bright Steel dispute has also hit other suppliers to the car-making industry. ""I am sure there are half a dozen others on the brink,"" the source said.

3140,"Australia's Industrial Relations Commission (IRC) is due to award the nation's lowest paid workers a wage rise on Tuesday, a decision that could have profound implications for inflation and monetary policy.
Australian financial markets generally expect the AIRC to award workers a wage rise of A$10 to A$15 per week.
The Industrial Relations Commission will hand down its decision on the trade union movement's claim for national wage rises at 0400 GMT (2 p.m.) in Sydney.  
The decision will be keenly watched not only by workers and their employers, but by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), which has repeatedly warned of the threat real wage rises pose to the nation's recent record of low inflation.
The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) has asked the IRC to grant Australia's lowest paid workers a wage rise of A$20 per week as well as a 8.75 percent rise in minimum rates of pay.
The RBA estimated the claim, if granted in full, would swell the nation's total wages bill by 1.6 percent, taking the current rate of wages growth to about 5.5 percent, well above the central bank's comfort zone of up to 4.5 percent.  
A complete victory by the ACTU on Tuesday would not only be expected to hasten a rise in official interest rate, now expected in early 1998, but would in the view of employers send the jobless rate sharply higher.
""If the ACTU claim were granted, unemployment would race past a million, inflation would rise well above its current level, interest rates would lift and investment growth would come to an immediate halt,"" a peak employer group has warned.  
The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said it believes the ACTU's ""living wage"" claim would increase the national wages bill by more like 4.8 percent, based on an industry survey showing most workers were covered by the claim.
But financial market economists are more sanguine than the captains of industry, predicting the Industrial Relations Commission will leave minimum rates of pay alone and grant a wage rise of between A$10 and A$15 per week for the lowest paid.
This would still exceed the government's position, which is to support a rise of A$8 per week for the lowest paid.  
""We don't expect them to give twenty-something dollars (a week). Probably between A$10 and A$15,"" National Australia Bank chief economist Alan Oster told Reuters on Monday.
""I think once you are up around A$20, you are...starting to cause some jitters,"" he added.
The Commonwealth Bank of Australia expects the commission to award a pay rise of A$10 to A$12, which it said would be consistent with underlying inflation remaining at the lower end of the RBA's target range of two to three percent.  
Bankers Trust expect a wage rise of between A$11 and A$14, but warn that the ""wild card"" will be if higher paid workers try to stay well ahead of the pack and seek similar pay rises.
""If a modest A$11 to A$14 outcome were to eventuate as expected, however, we do not think this would upset relativities greatly and therefore should dampen the risk of large follow-on wage claims,"" Bankers Trust said in a research report.
The wage decision comes at a tense moment for the financial markets and central bank, with inflation data for the March quarter to be released on Wednesday. Economists are tipping 2.1 percent underlying inflation, year on year.

3151,"Kellogg Co., in a move to broaden its breakfast food business and help offset sluggish cereal sales, said Monday it will acquire the Lender's Bagels business from Kraft Foods Inc. for $455 million.
Lender's, based in White Plains, N.Y., is the nation's largest maker of fresh and frozen bagels sold in grocery stores, with annual sales of about $275 million. Kraft is owned by Philip Morris Cos. Inc., the New York-based food and tobacco giant.
""Lender's Bagels is a perfect fit for Kellogg Company's fast-growing convenience foods business,"" Kellogg Chairman Arnold Langbo said.
""With our heritage based in nutrition and our technical competence in grain-based food products, adding the nation's number one brand in bagels ... offers substantial new opportunities to grow our business,"" he said in a statement.
Analysts said the deal would extend Kellogg's reach into America's breakfast pantry by moving it into the fast-growing bagel business, with sales estimated at about $2.8 billion a year.
In addition to being the world's largest maker of ready-to-eat breakfast cereal, Kellogg also makes Pop-Tarts toaster pastries, Eggo frozen waffles and Nutri-Grain breakfast bars.
""It's a good fit in that it is a breakfast business,"" said Goldman Sachs (corrects from Salomon Brothers) analyst Nomi Ghez. 
""It recognizes that the cereal market has matured, and other areas are eating into it. They have to move into those other areas.""
The deal, expected to close by year-end, includes Lender's plants in New Haven, Conn.; Mattoon, Ill., and Buffalo, N.Y., Kellogg said.
But the acquisition is not big enough to halt the erosion in Kellogg's mainstay cereal business, analysts said. Price cuts of about 19 percent this year have failed to boost demand, and Kellogg's cereal sales fell as much as 15 percent in the third quarter due to stiff competition, they said.
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. Monday cut its ratings outlook for $1.3 billion in Kellogg corporate debt to negative from stable because it believes the company will have difficulty in recapturing lost sales and improving profits.
Kellogg's earlier this month warned that its first quarter 1997 profits will likely fall below the year-earlier results.
Kellogg stock fell 12.5 cents to $68.125 on the New York Stock Exchange.
At a price of more than 1.5 times Lender's sales, the acquisition will depress Kellogg's earnings slightly in 1997, Ghez estimated. It should boost profits in 1998, she said.
Joseph Stewart, Kellogg's senior vice president of corporate affairs, said the company sees long-term growth prospects for Lender's Bagels, which has 45 percent of the nation's prepackaged bagel market.
""This is a long-term positive proposition to build shareholder value,"" Stewart said.
Kraft, based in Northfield, Ill., is the nation's largest packaged food company with revenues of $16 billion.
Kellogg, based in Battle Creek, Mich., has annual sales of about $7 billion.

3163,"Chrysler Corp. will report record earnings for 1996, based on record worldwide sales of 2.97 million vehicles, company chairman Robert Eaton said Tuesday.
""We're going to have a record year,"" Eaton said in an interview at Detroit's North American International Auto Show.
Chrysler's previous annual profit record came in 1994, when the company earned $3.713 billion. It earned $2.025 billion in 1995, when sales were held to 2.61 million units by the launch of its current line of minivans.
Eaton also said Chrysler in 1997 should be able to exceed its 1996 sales results because the company will be able to produce about 190,000 more trucks in 1997 than in 1996.
The increase will be come from added capacity for the new Dodge Durango sport utility vehicle in Newark, Del., as well as increased assembly line speeds for the Dodge Ram pickup truck in St. Louis, and increased production of Dodge Dakota pickup trucks in Warren, Mich.
Chrysler planned to unveil the Durango at the Detroit auto show later Tuesday.
Eaton said despite sluggish industrywide car sales and the increasing popularity and profitability of light trucks, the automaker has not cut back on investment in future car programmes.
He said, however, that Chrysler may shift its investment plans if trucks continued to gain market share.
""We're going to put the money where the market goes,"" he said, adding that new, more efficient truck engines should allow Chrysler to continue to increase truck capacity without violating federal fuel economy laws.
Eaton reiterated that Chrysler can earn still earn a profit even if U.S. automotive industry sales fall by 20 percent.
Separately, Chrysler Vice Chairman Robert Lutz, who recently cut back on his corporate responsibilities, said he he still saw himself as an integral part of Chrysler's product creation activities.
""I don't see that anything changed,"" Lutz said. As of Jan. 1, Lutz gave up his president and chief operating officer titles to become vice chairman in anticipation of his 65th birthday in February.
Lutz is largely credited with turning around Chrysler's product development operations by instituting a system of super-efficient ""platform teams"" to bring each new vehicle to market. He said he will continue to act as a coach and mentor to engineers working on Chrysler's car and truck programmes.
Lutz said he will probably stay at Chrysler for a maximum of two more years.
""I have to use this transitional period to ease myself out gradually, because the harsh reality is that I cannot stay around until I'm 70,"" he said. ""I would be seriously worried about a company that had its product fortunes guided by a 70-year-old guy. That usually results in cars directed at 70-year-olds.""

Eaton took over Lutz's chief operating officer duties and now has several executive vice presidents reporting directly to him.
Lutz said the new structure will give Eaton a chance to work more closely with the executive vice presidents, which will ease the transition to the next generation of leadership. He declined to comment on which executive vice presidents -- who include product development chief Thomas Gale, international chief Francois Castaing and sales and marketing chief James Holden -- have the best shot at succeeding the 57-year-old Eaton as the company's next chief executive.

3175,"Ford Motor Co., following several competitors in offering ""certified"" used cars, said Monday its Ford and Lincoln brands are starting used vehicle warranty programmes that eventually will be available nationwide.
Under the programmes, Ford and Lincoln-Mercury dealers will put cars and trucks through special inspection and reconditioning processes and offer factory-backed warranties and three-day, money-back guarantees.
""This is not just an individual, dealer programme,"" said Ford division spokesman Dan Bedore. ""It's backed by the Ford Motor Company.""
The Ford Division programme will be launched in the spring following a regional rollout in the southeastern United States in mid-November, while the Lincoln programme will be introduced in major markets Dec. 9.
A third programme covering Ford's Mercury brand cars and trucks will begin next summer, a Ford spokesman said.
The programmes are among several now offered by major automakers, including General Motors Corp. and Toyota Motor Corp., in an effort to keep their dealers competitive in the growing market for used cars and trucks.
Ample supplies of used vehicles that have come off of two-year leases have given rise to several new used-car ""superstore"" chains, such as Circuit City Stores Inc.'s successful CarMax unit, and a new chain called AutoNation USA, started by Blockbuster Entertainment founder H. Wayne Huizenga.
Ford estimated the annual pre-owned car and truck market at 43 million units and $370 billion in revenues. Automakers are expected to sell about 15.5 million new cars and trucks in the United States this year.
To qualify for the Ford Quality Certified programme, Ford brand cars and trucks must be under four years old and have been driven less than 50,000 miles. Those vehicles must pass a 100-point inspection, and following reconditioning, will receive a one-year, 12,000-mile warranty, 24-hour assistance and a three-day, 300-mile money-back guarantee.
To qualify for the Lincoln Assured prgram, Lincoln luxury cars must be one-owner 1994 models or later with less than 36,000 miles and have suffered no major damage.
They will undergo a 150-point inspection and will be backed by a two-year, 24,000-mile bumper-to-bumper warranty, Lincoln-Mercury said, adding that brake pads will be replaced on all Lincoln cars with more than 25,000 miles.

3179,"Chrysler Corp. said on Monday it has developed a new way to extract hydrogen from gasoline that could shave 10 years off the introduction of super-efficient electric cars powered by ""fuel cells.""
Chrysler said the system it developed would use normal gasoline to obtain hydrogen and power a future car with a 50 percent increase in fuel efficiency over current cars.
Cars using the system would be vastly more expensive than cars with internal combustion engines. But Chrysler officials said the system could be commercially viable by 2010 to 2015.  
If the system ever makes it out of the laboratory, drivers of gasoline fuel cell cars would simply refuel at a normal gasoline station, although the car would have a smaller tank than those used today. Chrysler hopes to have a working test vehicle within three years.
""We believe hydrogen needs to be processed from gasoline on-board vehicles because hydrogen isn't a practical fuel choice today,"" Francois Castaing, Chrysler's vice president of vehicle engineering, said at the North American International Auto Show here  
""Simply put, there's not any filling stations supplying it to a mass market,"" Castaing said.
Further development of the elaborate system -- called an on-board ""refinery"" by Chrysler advanced technologies specialist Christopher Borroni-Bird -- faces significant hurdles. Packed with precious metal catalysts to remove harmful sulfur and carbon monoxide emissions, it would currently cost 10 times more than a conventional internal combustion engine, or about $30,000.  
Long used in spacecraft applications, fuel cells generate electricity through the chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen, triggered by a platinum catalyst.
Detroit automotive engineers have studied them as a potential power source, but have scratched their heads at the problems associated with producing, distributing and storing highly volatile hydrogen fuel. The on-board ""refinery"" would solve that problem by extracting hydrogen from gasoline.  
""In time, we think development of this processor will help open the door to the use of fuel cells as the primary power source in a series hybrid vehicle that meets consumer demands for range and performance,"" Castaing said.
The first wave of modern electric vehicles from Detroit and Japan are now being introduced. They rely on batteries to provide electrical energy, but their range is severely limited.  
General Motors Corp became the industry's first automaker to introduce a new-generation vehicle, the $35,000 two-seat EV1, which can only drive 60 to 70 miles between charges.
Automakers also are tinkering with hybrid electric vehicles, which use a small internal combustion engine to drive a generator that supplies electricity to drive the wheels. The cars also use an interim storage device, such as a battery or flywheel.
Automotive engineers say the major problem with such hybrids is their high cost -- they essentially use two separate powertrains, instead of just one in conventional internal combustion cars.

3183,"Dow Corning Corp. said Monday it would set aside up to $2 billion to pay silicone breast implant claims under a $3 billion bankruptcy reorganization plan but that it also was seeking a trial on whether the implants cause diseases.
Dow Corning said the plan, filed Monday with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Bay City, Mich., would provide up to an additional $1 billion to pay commercial creditors.
The Midland, Mich.-based company, a joint venture between Dow Chemical Co. and Corning Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in May 1995 because of lawsuits by thousands of women who alleged that their implants have caused a variety of medical problems, including lupus and other autoimmune disorders.
Dow Corning introduced silicone gel breast implants in 1964 and was the largest maker of the products until the Food and Drug Administration imposed a moratorium in 1992.
Under the reorganization plan, Dow Corning said it would set up a $600 million fund for out-of-court settlements. Another $1.4 billion would become available for implant claims if it was proven in a trial that implants caused disease.
Dow Corning said it wanted a jury to hear testimony from a court-appointed, independent panel of doctors on the issue and to decide whether the company should compensate claimants.
The company has long held that numerous scientific studies have failed to show a link between the implants and disease.
""We believe the value of breast implant claims should be based on the best and most compelling scientific evidence available,"" Dow Corning Chairman Richard Hazleton said in a statement. He added that the plan ""provides a fair process to resolve the central legal controversy of whether breast implants cause disease.""
Plaintiffs said the $600 million settlement fund was not enough to address the needs of some 300,000 women who have received Dow Corning implants.
""It is not adequate to address the number of tort claims and the kinds of tort claims they face,"" said Elizabeth Cabraser, a San Francisco attorney representing women with breast implants. ""This is not a plan that is ready to go out of the box or should be approved.""
Cabraser said a committee of plantiffs attorneys would submit an alternative proposal to the bankruptcy court in the coming weeks.
Sybil Niden Goldrich, a former breast cancer sufferer and plaintiff who had her implants removed in 1984, said the out-of-court settlements would likely only give women about $2,000 each -- an amount she said would not cover the cost of removal.
""You can't sell these things for 30 years and just give women $2,000 and tell them to go away,"" she said.
If Dow Chemical ends up spending the full $2 billion on implant claims, it would be roughly the same amount as the company agreed to pay in a global settlement plan that collapsed in 1995.
In November 1995, five other manufacturers, including Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Baxter International Inc. and Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co. agreed to a new open-ended settlement offer that would pay women up to $250,000 each.
Hazleton said the plan would ensure the viability of Dow Corning while providing women with flexible options to resolve their claims and preserving their right to a jury trial.
The plan offered five settlement choices available over several years to process and resolve the claims:
-- Women who can prove a physical injury arising from a Dow Corning implant could obtain an expedited cash payment.
-- Those who want to have their implants removed could obtain a certificate for an ""explant"" procedure.
-- Women with claims that meet an established range of criteria could obtain a cash payment, but the precise definition of the criteria and the payment schedule would depend on the outcome of the causation trial.
-- Women could also choose an individual evaluation of their claim, which would require a higher level of proof, including a possible independent medical examination.
-- Women could also agree on non-binding mediation as an alternative to proceeding with the expense and uncertainty of a jury trial, it said.
Dow Chemical's stock closed up 25 cents at $84 and Corning rose 62.5 cents to $41.125 Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.
Separately, specialty materials maker Rogers Corp. said it has received approvals to buy Dow Corning's Bisco Products silicone foam business for $12 million. Rogers and Dow Corning have agreed to continue to work together to develop silicone foam resins over a seven-year period.

3197,"Chrysler Corp. Tuesday announced $380 million in new investments for South America, including assembly plants for pickup trucks and diesel engines in Brazil and the expansion of a Jeep plant now being built in Argentina.
Chrysler, which is cautiously trying to rebuild its international presence, said the projects in Brazil were worth about $315 million, and the expansion in Argentina was worth about $65 million.
Roughly one third of the total investment, or about $126.6 million, will come from Chrysler's suppliers, who will play a major role in the automaker's low-risk global growth strategy, Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton said.
""We don't intend to make risky investments just to be a major player in emerging markets,"" added Thomas Gale, Chrysler's executive vice president of international operations. ""We're quite content to grow at a steady pace in regions where we see solid opportunities.""
Eaton said the investments will boost Chrysler's sales in the Mercosur free-trade zone, which groups Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.
But the company's limited production capacity will allow it only to grab a small portion of the Mercosur market away from rivals General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG, he said.
""We are targeting very specific market segments,"" he said. ""We don't have any interest or desire to offer a vehicle for every possible application.""
The new Brazilian plant, which will be Chrysler's third limited-production facility in South America, will assemble the automaker's all-new Dakota compact pickup truck for sale in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, the countries in the Mercosur free-trade zone.
In Argentina, Chrysler said it will add production of about 6,000 Jeep Cherokees a year at a plant now under construction in the Cordoba province. The plant is already scheduled to build about 14,000 Jeep Grand Cherokees per year starting next April, and Cherokee output will begin in 1998.
A site for the Brazilian plant will be selected by year-end and vehicles will roll off the assembly line starting in mid-1998, Chrysler said. Production, however, will be modest, with 12,000 trucks in the first year and an ultimate capacity of 40,000 units annually. Employment will start at 400 people.
The trucks at first will be largely assembled from ""complete knock-down"" kits shipped from the United States, but the automaker intends to meet the Mercosur trade bloc's 60 percent local content requirement after three years.
Chrysler has not decided whether to market the Dakota under the Dodge brand name or under one of its other brands. The automaker now uses the only Jeep and Chrysler brand names outside the United States, Canada and Mexico.
The $315 million Brazil investment also includes a new diesel engine plant to be built by Detroit Diesel Corp..
The $10 million facility will supply the company's Italian-designed VM Motori four-cylinder turbocharged diesel engines for use in the Brazilian Dakota as well as in Jeep models built in Argentina. Chrysler installs about 40,000 of the engines annually into minivans and Jeep Grand Cherokees sold in Europe.
Others suppliers supporting the Chrysler by opening plants in Latin America include Dana Corp., Johnson Controls Inc., Lear Corp., Lear Corp. United Technologies Corp. and PPG Industries Inc., Chrysler executives said.
Eaton said total annual vehicle sales in the four-country Mercosur region will increase from about 2 million units currently to about 2.5 million by the end of the decade.
""We think this is a major growth area,"" Eaton said. ""It's politically and economically a stable region, we think with particularly rising consumer buying power.""
Including a small plant in Venezuela that assembles Cherokees and Neon small cars from kits, the investments announced Tuesday bring to $735 million the total financial commitments Chrysler and its suppliers have made in South America, the company said.
Chrysler stock rose 25 cents to close at $28.875 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.

3202,"Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin outlined on Wednesday the Clinton administration's plan to allow banks to get into the securities and insurance businesses, eliminating 60-year-old legal barriers enacted during the Great Depression.
""The old lines that separated insurance, securities and banking industries have increasingly blurred as new financial services and products have appeared,"" Rubin said.
The plan would allow banks, securities firms and insurance companies to compete directly under a uniform set of regulations. That increased competition should benefit consumers, generating savings of up to $15 billion a year, Rubin said in a speech at the Exchequer Club here.
The highly anticipated administration proposal, originally expected in March, takes its place with several bills already introduced in Congress. ""We look forward to working with Congress on this important initiative,"" Rubin said.
House Banking Committee Chairman Jim Leach welcomed the plan, but said some substantive issues were unresolved.
""While differences of judgment on several key legislative points remain, Secretary Rubin's statement today is very constructive to the process,"" the Iowa Republican said.
Industry participants said the administration plan would give the reform effort a needed boost.
The proposal ""should provide considerable momentum for long-needed reform,"" Bankers Trust New York Corp. Chairman Frank Newman said. Newman gave the effort some prior momentum last month, when his bank took advantage of recent regulatory changes and acquired the securities firm Alex. Brown Inc.
Consumer advocates, however, complained that the proposal did not contain adequate measures to protect bank customers buying insurance.
""We're very disappointed that there are no protections on insurance,"" Mary Griffin of Consumers Union said. Banks have a weak track record in that area, she added.
Credit insurance on mortgages, the second most popular insurance product sold by banks, ""is one of the biggest consumer rip-offs out there,"" she said.
The Rubin proposal did not take a firm position on the controversial question of allowing banks to combine with non-financial, commercial firms.
""Because of the nature of the issues and the complete lack of consensus, we think the issue needs to be further debated by Congress before settling on a final approach,"" Rubin said.
Some lawmakers, along with smaller banks and consumer groups, adamantly oppose allowing banks to combine with commercial firms. But insurance companies and securities firms say they are already intertwined with non-financial interests and could not compete with banks if such combinations were not permitted.
Rubin outlined two possible approaches. Under one approach, some mixing would be permitted but limited and with the 1,000 largest non-financial firms excluded.
Under a second approach, no mixing would be allowed with banks but, as currently permitted, thrifts would be allowed to combine with commercial firms.

3211,"Congress revives the debate over encryption export policy this week but much has changed since last year's tussles.
Once the domain of spies and generals, encryption has become a critical component of electronic commerce and global communications on the Internet.
This year, the Clinton administration has a new policy in place allowing freer export of encryption products, which are programmes that scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software ""key.""
The new Clinton policy, enacted through executive order in November and in effect since January 1, allows export of stronger encryption than previously allowed. But it requires companies to incorporate features within two years allowing the government to crack the codes by getting access to the software keys.
The government says it needs the ability to crack strong encryption to catch criminals and terrorists.
While a few companies, most notably International Business Machines, have obtained export licenses under the new policy, most high-tech companies remain frustrated.
They want to be able to export very strong encryption without including the government access features.
Privacy advocates also oppose the current Clinton policy, which they say puts too much power in the hands of government.
Since the government does not require guaranteed access to the keys to one's home, it should not be given such access to the keys to one's data, they argue. ""My lock, my key,"" is the slogan on their buttons this week.
In congress, the passage of time has crystallised the issue for many members and both sides in the debate have found new allies. Last year, most lawmakers seemed either in favour of relaxed export restrictions or undecided.
The full Senate Commerce Committee will hear testimony Wednesday on two bills introduced in the Senate to remove almost all export restrictions, and Thursday, the House Judiciary subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property will debate a similiar bill under consideration there.
At the House encryption hearing, Under Secretary of Commerce William Reinsch, deputy director of the National Security Agency William Crowell and a member of the Department of Justice criminal division, will defend the Clinton policy.
The Senate will also hear from FBI director Louis Freeh and special encryption envoy David Aaron.
Industry representatives at the hearings will include officials from Netscape Communications Corp., one of the most vocal administration critics, and Microsoft Corp.
Privacy advocates will testify in the House, including Jerry Berman, executive director of the Centre for Democracy and Technology, and Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information Centre.

3224,"U.S. lawmakers redrafting a legislative proposal to modernize U.S. banking laws will rely heavily on the Clinton administration's reform plan, congressional staffers said on Wednesday.
But whatever provisions end up in the new draft, expected to be finished by Friday, the real battle will be fought when the House Banking Committee begins its formal consideration, or mark up, of the proposal currently scheduled for next week.  
""The goal here is to get in the (bill) those areas where there is general agreement,"" committee spokesman David Runkel said.
""The intent is to use as much of the Treasury (Department's) language as appropriate,"" Runkel said. The most controversial questions will be resolved as lawmakers offer varied amendments during the mark up, he added.
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin unveiled the administration's plan to overhaul antiquated U.S. banking laws in a speech on May 21.  
In testimony on Tuesday, Rubin urged Congress to scrap the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act and free banks to enter other financial sectors like insurance and securities underwriting.
At least four major areas of disagreement remain that will be the focus of the scheduled June 11 mark up, staffers said. Some lawmakers want the mark up delayed at least a week, however, so the session could be delayed.
First, wide differences of opinion exist among legislators about whether financial firms should be allowed to engage in nonfinancial, commercial activities. The administration ducked the difficult question, offering two alternatives instead.  
Three earlier bills also each took a different approach and numerous alternatives have been floated in recent weeks. ""You'll see it all at the mark up,"" one staffer predicted.
Also, the insurance industry is up in arms about provisions in the administration plan that may broaden a 1996 Supreme Court decision limiting state regulation of bank insurance sales. The bill would allow federal bank regulators to overrule state insurance authorities in some instances.
""This could have the effect of threatening the safety and soundness of the nation's insurance system,"" said David Pratt, senior vice president of the American Insurance Association.  
A third controversey sprouted from one of the administration's two ""alternatives"" on banking and commerce.
The plan said Congress could allow limited mixing or keep the current prohibition while also maintaining the present exception allowing commercial companies to own thrifts.
Under the second option, thrifts and banks would continue to operate under different federal charters. That outraged the banking industry, which thought it made a deal last year guaranteeing the charters would be merged.  
""A very critical piece if the puzzle will be that any financial reform measure specifically deals with the thrift charter issue,"" said Beth Climo, group director of financial industry affairs at the American Bankers Association.
""That is the fundamental thing that needs to be addressed,"" Climo said.
Another area of disagreement surrounds proposals to allow creation of so-called wholesale financial institutions, or ""woofies."" These bank-like entities could only take deposits over $100,000 and would not receive deposit insurance.
Some opponents of mixing banking and commerce fear that wholesale banks represent a significant loophole, since a commercial company could set up a ""woofie.""
Banking Committee chairman Jim Leach said earlier this week that he hoped to have the committee approve a bill and send it to the House floor by July 4.
But even if a majority of the banking panel can reach a consensus, the bill will be sequentially referred to the House Commerce Committee. That committee could then hold its own mark up or even stall the legislation.

3231,"The Clinton administration has crafted a plan to reform what many call outdated U.S. banking laws and will begin making its positions known over the next few weeks, industry officials said Monday.
The administration will formally unveil its plan when Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin testifies at a House Banking Committee hearing June 3, but details of the plan are expected to emerge as early as this week, the officials said.
Under Secretary John Hawke, a leading architect of the administration plan, is slated to speak here on Wednesday. In his speech, Hawke may indicate the administration's stand on mixing banking and commerce, lobbyists said.
""Mr. Hawke certainly won't do anything to upstage Rubin,"" one lobbyist in contact with the administration noted. ""But we will hear generally where they are on some of these topics.""
While most in Congress and the finance industry agree that the Depression-era barriers separating banking from securities and insurance should be torn down, there is little consensus about going farther and allowing banks to combine with securities and other firms.
The administration's position has evolved over the past several months. A task force on financial reform headed by Hawke initially recommended eliminating all barriers.
But the specter of Citicorp or Chase Manhattan merging with General Motors Corp. or Microsoft Corp. drew strong protests from House Banking Committee Chairman Jim Leach of Iowa, as well as prominent labour and consumer groups.
And during the spring, several Democratic senators, led by Paul Sarbanes of Maryland, wrote to Rubin to register their opposition to mixing banking and commerce.
Bowing somewhat to the criticism, the administration is now said to favour allowing limited combinations. Financial firms would be limited to a ""basket"" of non-financial activity, expressed as a percentage of total revenue or capital, some lobbyists said.
But the basket could be further limited by prohibiting combinations of the largest financial and non-financial firms. For example, one approach would be to bar the 1,000 biggest commercial firms from owning or being owned by banks.
Another difficult issue concerns regulating disparate financial businesses within a diversified firm.
Almost everyone favours ""functional regulation,"" meaning that each activity of a firm would be regulated by the appropriate regulator. The Securities and Exchange Commission would regulate securities activities while state insurance regulators would oversee insurance sales, for example.
But debate continues about the level of federal intrusion in insurance regulation as well as the need for a top-level regulator to oversee entire firms.
While some favour setting the Federal Reserve at the top of the heap, the administration is expected to back a committee approach. The committee would be composed of representatives of the various functional regulators.

3235,"The Clinton administration gave a solid boost this week to congressional efforts to overhaul antiquated U.S. banking laws but substantial hurdles remain, participants in the debate said.
On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin outlined the administration's plan to eliminate the 1933 Glass-Steagall legal barriers separating banks from securities firms and insurance companies.
The administration plan was due to Congress by March 31 and the nearly two-month delay had some lobbyists fearing that the administration would avoid the tangled regulatory controversies and not submit anything.
Congress has sought to reform banking laws for more than a decade, but one interest group or another has always managed to block passage of legislation. In prior years, banks sought reform, while other financial firms opposed change.
Recently, courts and regulators have granted banks new authority, however. That brought insurance companies and securities firms to the table to seek a level playing field.
""There is renewed hope that the 105th Congress will tackle this difficult issue,"" said David Farmer, lobbyist for the Alliance of American Insurers, after Rubin's speech.
The action now shifts to the Banking committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate, where detailed reform measures will be drafted. Rubin will provide more details of the Clinton plan in testimony before Congress on June 3.
House Banking Committee Chairman James Leach said this week that drafting will begin immediately after that testimony and that he wants committee action completed by mid-June.
It is at the drafting stage where some past efforts to reform banking laws have foundered as competing interests fought over the details.
The new administration proposal ducked one of the most contentious issues -- whether banks should be allowed to combine with non-financial, commercial firms.
Instead of taking sides, Rubin offered two alternatives. Under one plan, banks would be allowed a limited amount of commercial activity, but the largest 1,000 commercial companies could not own or be owned by banks.
Under a second alternative, the current prohibition would be continued, but the current exception allowing savings and loans to be owned by commercial companies would also be maintained.
Several months ago, administration officials were discussing proposals to allow nearly unlimited mixing of banking and commerce. The apparent retreat left advocates of greater mixing fuming.
""Their recommendation is tantamount to surrender on the issue,"" Minnesota Democrat Rep. Bruce Vento said.
Vento and New Jersey Republican Rep. Marge Roukema introduced a bill in January that would allow banks to have a ""basket"" of commercial activity accounting for up to 25 percent of an institution's total business.
Another blow to Vento and Roukema's efforts came Thursday when Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan testified before the House Banking Committee.
Greenspan said Congress should eliminate Glass-Steagall now, but put off the banking and commerce issue for future review. ""Any wider authorization of banking and commerce should be postponed while we focus on financial modernization,"" he said.
Now the banking and commerce issue threatens to derail their backing, said bank consultant Karen Shaw Petrou, president of ISD/Shaw Inc.
""The administration's plan is a decent baby-step,"" Petrou said. ""But unsurprisingly, it's not the lightning bolt that transforms the debate.""
Securities firms and insurance companies are involved in commercial activity, but want to get into banking if banks are allowed into their fields.
""If you don't allow banking and commerce, then you create obstacles for non-banks,"" Petrou said. ""But somebody's twist or turn to solve that then creates another problem for someone else.""
Even a small percentage limit on commercial activity would accommodate the largest non-bank financial companies, according to research from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. released on Thursday.
Among the seven securities firms in the Fortune 1000, plus Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., none earned much more than 5 percent of their revenue from commercial activity in 1996, the FDIC estimated.
Only one of the five largest life and health insurers and one of the five largest property and casualty firms exceeded the 5 percent level, the FDIC said.
Four of the 10 largest diversified financial firms would exceed the 5 percent level, however. American Express derived 9 to 14 percent of its revenue from commercial activities, for example, and Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos Inc. had 28 percent of revenues from commerce.

3237,"A top federal regulator Thursday urged banks to be more careful in issuing credit cards as an industry group reported that late payments by consumers jumped to a record level at the end of last year.
The latest sign that consumers are overburdened with credit card debt came in survey by the American Bankers Association.
The group said that in the fourth quarter of 1996 late payments jumped to 3.72 percent of credit card accounts, the highest rate since it began tracking delinquencies in 1980 and up from 3.34 percent a year earlier.
The survey, in conjunction with earlier reports that personal bankruptices are at record levels and bank losses from credit card loans are growing, has bank regulators on edge.
Comptroller of the Currency Eugene Ludwig, whose office oversees almost 3,000 nationally chartered banks, said the problems, while still under control, raise concerns about the safety and soundess of banks.
""We are continuing to see signs of slippage in some areas that you and we must address now,"" he told a New York State Bankers Association meeting in Washington on Thursday.
""It is worrisome to consider that there was a 44 percent growth in credit card losses and a 50 percent increase in credit card delinquencies during the past year,"" Ludwig said.
Ludwig also noted that bank chargeoffs on credit cards ""increased significantly"" in January to 6.5 percent of the $220 billion of loans outstanding from 4.7 percent a year earlier.
""These statistics are particularly troubling given the current health of the economy,"" he said.
As a result, the Comptroller's office issued an advisory to banks on credit underwriting standards and portfolio credit risk management, Ludwig said.
""The role of the regulator is to take action before potential problems become real problems,"" Ludwig said. ""Our goal is to remind national banks how changes in underwriting standards affect overall portfolio credit risk and to highlight the key component of an effective portfolio credit risk management process.""
Tighter loan standards should prevent the problem from getting out of hand, but losses may grow further before the new standards have an impact, Ludwig said.
""Current losses likely represent weaker credits making their way through the pipeline,"" he said. ""We can expect some continued losses, but hopefully we'll begin to see positive effects of those cautious underwriting decisions.""
Bankers had expected that tighter credit standards put into place in recent years would already have started reducing losses.
""We are disappointed that the numbers didn't improve,"" American Bankers Association chief economist James Chessen said. ""We had hoped that banks' tightening of credit standards over the last several years would have reversed the trend of delinquencies by now.""
In the fourth quarter of 1996, 37 percent of banks reported tightening standards, a drop from 49 percent in both the second and third quarters of 1996, the association said.
Delinquency rates also ticked up on home equity loans, the group reported. The delinquency rate was 1.42 percent in the fourth quarter of 1996, compared with 1.29 percent in the previous quarter and 1.41 percent in the same period the previous year.
On auto loans, the delinquency rate was 2.03 percent in the fourth quarter of 1996, compared with 1.95 percent the previous quarter and 1.87 percent a year earlier.
Delinquent payments are defined as 30 days or more overdue.

3240,"A bill to dramatically relax U.S. export controls on computer encoding technology will be considered by a House Judiciary subcommittee on Wednesday, congressional staff members said Monday.
Heading for a vote, the bill garnered an endorsement from a politically diverse coalition of Internet privacy advocates.
In a related development Netscape Communications Corp. said the Commerce Department gave the Internet software company permission to export some products containing stronger encoding, or encryption, features.
Current U.S. laws strictly limit export of products with encryption, software that scrambles information and renders it unreadable unless one has a password or software ""key.""
Netscape, which had been allowed to export encryption software with keys 40 bits long, said it will now be able to sell abroad products with 56-bit keys. The longer the key, the harder it is to crack an encoded message, and the 56-bit key makes it 65,000 times tougher to decode.
The Security and Freedom through Encryption Act, sponsored by Virginia Republican Representative Robert Goodlatte, would allow U.S. companies to export strong encryption programmes if such products were being offered by foreign competitors.
The Clinton administration opposes the legislation, which it argues would allow international criminals and terrorists to get easy access to encryption that could thwart law enforcement agencies' efforts.
Under the adminstration's current policy, strong encryption can be exported only if it allows the government to crack the codes by recovering the software keys.
Netscape has promised to abide by that policy, said its chief scientist, Taher Elgamal. Within two years, its products will allow the government to decode encrypted data by gaining access to the keys.
If the bill is approved by the Courts and Intellectual Property subcommittee, the full Judiciary Committee will consider it, said David Lehman, legislative counsel for Goodlatte.
The legislation will sail through the subcommittee and be voted on by the full committee in a few weeks, according to Shabbir Safdar, executive director of the Voters Telecommunications Watch, one of the groups endorsing the measure Monday.
""It looks very promising with 78 co-sponsors,"" Safdar said. ""This is the best hope in the House for real encryption reform this decade.""
Others who endorsed the bill included the Centre for Democracy and Technology, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Americans for Tax Reform.
A similiar bill is pending in the Senate, where the Commerce Committee is expected to vote on its version in the next few weeks.
Not all civil libertarians favour the legislation as currently drafted. Another group, led by the American Civil Liberties Union, wrote Goodlatte this week asking him to delete a provision of the bill that would create new criminal penalties for using computer encryption ""in the furtherance of the commission of a criminal offence.""
The group generally backed Goodlatte's efforts but said in its letter the new criminal penalties ""could have a series of unintended consequences that would easily undermine the other desirable features of the bill.""
From the Internet community, signers included the Internet Society and two private companies, Cybercash Inc. and Digex Inc.
Instead of criminalizing use of encryption, the group said prosecutors should rely on existing federal and state laws prohibiting obstruction of justice and concealment of evidence.

3256,"Japan's deposit insurance system is expected to seek loans from banks through a tender later this year for the first time, financial sources say.
They said the move could fuel fears that funds available in the system may not be enough to protect depositors.
The tender would be aimed at repaying stopgap loans provided by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to the semi-governmental Deposit Insurance Corp of Japan (DIC).
The DIC borrowed 500 billion yen ($4.13 billion) from the central bank last month to pay 1.03 trillion yen ($8.5 billion) to a liquidation scheme for failed credit union Kizu Shinyo Kumiai.
The tender would take place after June, when financial institutions make half-yearly payments of deposit insurance premiums, which will cover part of the BOJ loans, they said.
In the tender, which would not be mandatory, banks would indicate interest rates on loans and the DIC would select those with lower rates.
""After such a huge amount of money was used for the Kizu scheme, we are increasingly worried about whether and how the DIC will protect depositors' money in the event of any large bank failure in future,"" said a bank official.
The deposit insurance system, set up in 1971, is designed to help prevent a financial crisis and protect depositors from any financial failures.
The DIC was dormant until 1992, but it has used a total of 2.05 trillion yen ($16.9 billion) in the past five years to bail out troubled financial institutions and cover losses stemming from a series of financial failures since 1995.
In addition, the DIC must provide funds to help wind up already failed regional bank Hanwa Bank and small credit union Sanpuku Shinyo Kumiai, the sources said.
Finance Ministry officials also said recently that bank debentures issued by long-term credit banks may be covered by the deposit insurance system until March 31, 2001, in order to protect creditors holding the debentures.
An official of the DIC said, however, that it had sufficient funds to deal with possible future problems at financial institutions.
Under financial bills passed by parliament last June aimed at solving Japan's problem loan mess, the DIC boosted the insurance premiums which financial institutions pay by seven times, to 0.084 percent of total deposits from 0.012 percent.
This means the DIC will get 500 billion yen ($4.13 billion) in premiums a year until 2001, the official said. Under the financial bills, it can also borrow a total of two trillion yen ($16.5 billion) from the central bank as stopgap funds.
But analysts and even influential politicians are not optimistic.
Takeo Nishioka, secretary-general of Japan's main opposition New Frontier Party, said in a television programme last weekend that the present deposit insurance system could not cope with bank failures.
At the end of September, Japan's deposit-taking financial institutions had 29.23 trillion yen ($239 billion) of problem loans, of which 7.3 trillion yen ($59.8 billion) had not been covered by loan-loss provisions and collateral, Finance Ministry data shows.
Analysts say the actual amount of problem loans must be more than double the official figure. If regulators want to deal with insolvent financial firms seriously, there are potentially three measures they can take, analysts say.
The first is to boost deposit insurance premiums and the second is the use of loans provided by the Bank of Japan.
But the central bank is unwilling to have its money used to bail out financial institutions, and it is difficult to keep on increasing the premiums that institutions must pay the DIC.
""So the final source is public money, and politicians are beginning to try to establish measures to cope with the situation,"" said Katsuhito Sasajima, an analyst at Nikko Research Center.
But it is no easy task to establish such measures after a storm of public criticism that blew up last year over the use of 685 billion yen ($5.66 billion) in taxpayers' money to help resolve bad loans held at collapsed housing loan companies.
""The key is whether the authorities can avoid emotional reactions from the public,"" said Yoshinobu Yamada, an analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan. ""While we believe public money is needed to ensure the stability of Japan's financial system, it may take a long time to reach a decision."" ($1=122 yen)

3262,"The latest scandal at Nomura Securities has seriously damaged the industry's image and the brokerage will be hard-pressed to convince investors it can clean up its act, analysts and market sources say.
In the latest development, the California Public Employees' Retirement Fund said on Tuesday it was suspending business with Nomura. The action came in the wake of a scandal over illicit transactions that could be linked with corporate racketeers.
The fund said, however, that it did not plan to take legal action against Nomura.
Sources close to the company say Nomura, rocked by its second major scandal in six years, will likely unveil a programme at the urging of the Finance Ministry to avoid a recurrence of such shady backroom deals.
The steps are expected to include the establishment of a compliance committee made up of senior management, the sources said. They also said Nomura's senior executives will accept salary cuts to atone for the scandal, in addition to president Hideo Sakamaki's resignation last Friday.
But analysts said Japan's top brokerage was responsible for a grave loss of investor confidence in the ethics of the securities industry as a whole.
The revelations about improper movements of funds between accounts raise fears that profits made in customers' accounts may be moved to brokers' own accounts, destroying the trust between investors and brokerages, they said.
Nomura said on March 6 that two of its directors, who have since resigned, had made discretionary transactions with a corporate client and transferred profits from Nomura's own account to the client's account.
Japanese media have said the corporate client was a relative of a one-time racketeer, but Nomura said it could not confirm the identity of the client.
Japanese newspaper and television reports have said Nomura had obtained profits worth about 40 million yen ($325,000) from trading in shares of Fuji Bank Ltd that it funnelled to the client's account on March 15, 1995.
A spokesman for Nomura declined to comment on the reports.
But Kazumasa Niimi, a senior economist at the Japan Research Institute, said if the reports were true, it raised questions over whether Fuji's share price was affected by Nomura's trading.
He said the volume of trading in bank shares is generally small, meaning trades of that size could influence the market price.
While the investigation is still under way with no charges made, industry sources said the transactions may have violated securities laws banning stock price manipulation.
Industry sources say the investigation is also looking into whether Nomura transferred profits from the brokerage's own account to that of a favoured client and made discretionary transactions without a client's consent.
Nomura sources also said the deals in question were on handwritten order forms, which would be easier to alter than computer printouts usually used to keep a record of transactions.
If the profits are then revealed to have been funnelled to a racketeer, this would also violate the commercial code, they said.
Corporate racketeers, called ""sokaiya"", extort money from companies by threatening to disturb shareholders' meetings or by offering to prevent disruption of the proceedings. Japanese commercial law has banned such payoffs since 1992.
Nomura has remained silent on the repercussions of the scandal since its president's resignation on Friday, saying it cannot comment as the matter is under investigation.
It will hold a regular board of directors' meeting on Wednesday, but a spokesman said the topics for discussion have not yet been decided.
A government source told Reuters last week that the probe by Japan's securities watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission, or SESC, is likely to take some time.
""In order to complete the investigation as soon as possible, an extraordinary amount of cooperation is needed from Nomura,"" he said.
He added that until recently, Nomura was not as cooperative as the authorities might have hoped.
In the last major scandal to rock Nomura, in 1991, two senior executives resigned from the board over revelations that the brokerage had compensated favoured clients for losses and that affiliates had dealt with gangsters. ($1=123 yen)

3281,"The resignation of the president of Nomura Securities Co Ltd on Friday should be only a first step by the country's top brokerage house in restoring its scandal-scarred image.
Analysts believe the resignation should just be to clear the decks so Nomura can carry out widespread management restructuring, including bringing in a young, untainted leader to help win back public trust.
In a hastily called news conference, Nomura president Hideo Sakamaki, 62, said that he had stepped down and would become simply an adviser to the firm. Chairman Masashi Suzuki, also 62, took over the post of president in addition to the chairmanship.
Sakamaki's resignation followed the departure of two Nomura directors who quit the brokerage last week after they were found to have made apparently illegal stock deals and funnelled funds to a corporate client linked by Japanese media to a former ""sokaiya"" racketeer.
Several analysts said the resignation stopped far short of the action needed to restore public trust.
David Threadgold, an analyst at BZW Securities Ltd, said although Sakamaki had resigned the failure to immediately announce his permanent replacement indicated the firm had not been able to find the right person to replace him.
Yushiro Ikuyo, first vice president of Smith Barney International Inc, said Nomura may take several years to recover from a scandal which was a repeat of similar incidents in the early 1990s.
Ikuyo said the fact there was a repeat scandal indicated there was a problem with Nomura's corporate mentality.
""Nomura has the potential to be a Japanese company which could be a winner in international competition and under Japan's ""Big Bang"" reforms as an investment bank,"" he said.
""To change the corporate culture, a drastic restructuring in management, such as the resignation of all senior executives, must be considered and a young and clean leader appointed,"" he said.
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has vowed to carry out ""Big Bang"" financial reforms to implement substantial deregulation by 2001.
A securities analyst, who declined to be named, was sceptical that a wholesale clean-up could be carried out.
""All the top executives have great contacts with corporate Japan,"" the analyst said. ""In Japanese business, it's also going to be hard to find a 'Mr. Clean.'""
A senior Finance Ministry (MOF) official told Reuters this week the ministry is waiting the outcome of investigations by the country's securities watchdog over the suspect deals.
But the official said MOF was focusing on whether Nomura violated the Commercial Code, rather than securities laws.
""Sokaiya"" extort money from a company by threatening to disturb a shareholders' meeting, or offer to prevent a disruption of the proceedings by unruly shareholders.
Japanese commercial law has prohibited paying off racketeers since 1982.
Ironically, Sakamaki's presidency began in 1991 when top executives Setsuya Tabuchi and Yoshihisa Tabuchi (no relation) resigned after revelations the brokerage compensated elite clients for losses and affiliates dealt with organised crime.
The two Tabuchis, however, rejoined Nomura's board in 1995, triggering a controversy among Nomura employees because the two were regarded as a symbol of the firm's previous tainted corporate culture -- aggressively grabbing profits, even sacrificing small investors' interests.
New president Suzuki said that the two Tabuchis offered to resign from the board again. He said he would accept their offers which are not related to the scandals.
""My first priority is to restore confidence. I would like to transform the company to one with a healthy situation and transfer the company to the next generation,"" Suzuki said.
He said that he would take all possible steps to avoid a recurrence of wrongdoing but fell short of announcing details.
""Nomura is not a family-run company and Suzuki's position as both president and chairman is something irregular,"" an analyst at a major local brokerage said.

3287,"The top executive of Japan's leading brokerage, Nomura Securities Co Ltd, resigned from his post on Friday to atone for a scandal over suspected illegal deals.
Nomura said president Hideo Sakamaki stepped down as of Friday and became an adviser to the company. Chairman Masashi Suzuki takes on the job of president in addition to the chairmanship.
""As the top official of the company, I think I should take responsibility,"" Sakamaki told a news conference.
The scandal broke last week when Nomura said two of its directors, who subsequently resigned, had made apparently illegal deals and funnelled funds to a corporate client linked by Japanese media to a former ""sokaiya"" racketeer.
The president's resignation, which was widely expected, comes amid signs that the scandal may be widening as suspicion falls on other prestigious Japanese brokerages.
Nomura's Sakamaki said the scandal was not endemic in the company itself, but added he did not know whether other Nomura executives were involved in the suspected illegal deals, which are being investigated by the nation's securities watchdog.
The brokerage pledged to strive to win back public trust.
""My first priority is to restore confidence,"" chairman Suzuki told the same news conference. ""We will take all possible measures to avoid any repetition of such scandals.""
Sokaiya, often linked to ""yakuza"" crime syndicates, typically try to extort money from firms by threatening to expose dubious business practices or to disturb shareholders' meetings -- called ""sokai"" in Japanese.
Companies have also been known to hire sokaiya to muzzle legitimate shareholders' questions at the annual meetings.
The case is another blot on the reputation of corporate Japan after a spate of scandals over unauthorised trading in financial markets, shady oil deals and overly cosy ties in the ""iron triangle"" of politics, business and bureaucracy.
Speculation is also spreading that similar scandals may emerge at other brokerages.
Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka said on Friday that regulators will likely probe Japan's other ""Big Four"" brokerages after reports that the corporate client cited in the Nomura scandal as having sokaiya links also holds accounts at other leading securities houses.
""It's hard to believe the authorities will sit by after such reports. It's common sense for them to conduct an appropriate investigation,"" he said.
Nomura had been widely expected to make a top management sacrifice to express remorse over its second scandal in just six years. In 1991, senior Nomura executives Setsuya Tabuchi and Yoshihisa Tabuchi (no relation) resigned over revelations the brokerage had compensated favoured clients for losses and that affiliates had dealt with gangsters.
The fate of the two Tabuchis, who rejoined Nomura's board in 1995, was being watched by some analysts for clues to how serious the brokerage was about internal reform. Nomura said on Friday that the two will quit the board again.
The scandal is a potentially serious blow to Nomura's business as well as its reputation, as a number of financial firms, including one in the Nomura group, have suspended dealings with the brokerage pending the outcome of the probe by the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (SESC).
Nomura also faces a possible shareholder suit seeking compensation for any losses resulting from the scandal.
Leading credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service said on Friday that short-term financial damage may be limited but Nomura faces the challenge of strengthening management control, restoring its reputation and regaining business momentum.

3289,"Two of Japan's most troubled banks took action on Tuesday to end their long-running financial woes, with one announcing a radical restructuring and the other finding a merger partner.
The moves are seen as just the beginning of a drive by the the indebted banking industry to get ready for Japan's emerging ""Big Bang"" era of financial deregulation.
Nippon Credit Bank Ltd, one of three long-term credit banks in Japan, announced that it would cease overseas operations, sell off its Tokyo headquarters as well as other property and write off bad loans totalling 460 billion yen ($3.7 billion).
Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, Japan's 10th-largest commercial bank, meanwhile, said it will merge with the smaller Hokkaido Bank Ltd and cease overseas operations to become a ""super-regional"" bank.
NCB said the restructuring will boost earnings by 50 billion yen ($403 million) over the next five years. It hopes to gain 67 billion yen ($540 million) from the real estate sales and will also eliminate 600 jobs to cut costs.
Despite the moves, NCB president Hiroshi Kubota told a news conference that he cannot rule out the possibility of a tie-up or merger with other banks in the future.
Earlier on Tuesday, NCB put three non-bank financial affiliates under bankruptcy protection.
As a long-term credit bank, NCB raises cash through issuing debentures rather than taking deposits.
The Japanese government, which has spoken of the benefits of deregulation and leaving the market alone, has taken a strong hand in ensuring that NCB survives, urging other banks to accept newly floated shares to help it rebuild its capital base.
The Ministry of Finance (MOF) also said it planned to use 80 billion yen ($645 million) from a special fund created to cope with bad loans from the collapse of ""jusen"" housing loan firms.
Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka told a news conference that the capital increase and disposing of bad loans ""will substantially improve NCB's business foundation and will contribute to the stability of financial systems both at home and abroad"".
Financial analysts have criticised the NCB plan, saying it would further weigh down other big banks, which are themselves in far from robust financial health.
In addition, some said the moves were too timid.
""The restructuring programme announced by Nippon Credit Bank is quite drastic, but when taking into account the size of its massive problem loans, the programme falls short of solving its bad loan woes,"" said Yushiro Ikuyo, first vice president of Smith Barney International Inc.
Hokkaido Takushoku said it had no choice but to retrench, ending lofty ambitions of being a global player in the banking world.
""We made the decision (on the overseas pullout) believing that it was inevitable to ensure leverage in our business while promoting bad loan write-offs,"" it said in a statement.
Hokkaido Takushoku said it and Hokkaido Bank would merge as equals by April 1998.
Both are headquartered in Sapporo, the largest city on Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido.
The merger will cut costs at the two banks and mean the elimination of 2,000 jobs.
It will also help Hokkaido Takushoku face its mountain of bad debts. The bank has long been considered the most troubled of Japan's major city banks and a merger candidate.
""It's a step in the right direction but they are taking two banks with huge bad debt problems -- merge them together and you've got a colossal bad debt problem to deal with,"" said Brian Waterhouse, an analyst at HSBC James Capel.
As part of the new focus it will shut down its six overseas branches in locations including New York and London and seven representative offices. It said the withdrawal from overseas operations would have only a limited impact on its business. ($1=124 yen)

3292,"An investigation by Japan's securities watchdog into possibly illegal deals at Nomura Securities Co Ltd is unlikely to be concluded quickly, a government source said on Tuesday.
The Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (SESC) has been investigating since last September and the probe is now centred on whether and how Nomura provided profits to a corporate customer, the source told Reuters.
The source said the investigation is likely to take at least a few more weeks, and urged Nomura to cooperate fully.  
""To complete the investigation as soon as possible, extraordinary cooperation is needed from Nomura,"" he said, adding that until recently Nomura was not as cooperative as the authorities might have hoped.
Under the Securities and Exchange Law, the SESC could advise the finance minister to hand down administrative punishment if it finds evidence of illegal activity. The heaviest penalty would be revocation of brokerage licences and suspension of business for up to six months.
Under the law, the SESC could also pass the case to prosecutors to pursue legal action.  
Nomura said last week that two of its directors made deals suspected to be ""discretionary"" transactions, meaning they were done without the client's knowledge, and moved profits raised from Nomura's own funds into a corporate client's account, practices banned under Japan's securities law. Media reports have linked the firm with a former ""sokaiya"" racketeer.
Nomura Securities has said it could not confirm the media reports that the corporate client was run by a relative of a ""sokaiya"".
Sokaiya are people who extort money from a company by threatening to disturb a shareholders' meeting, or by offering to prevent a disruption of the proceedings. Japanese commercial law has prohibited paying off racketeers since 1982.
A Nomura spokesman said the company did not know how long it would take for the SESC to complete its investigation.
""We must make utmost efforts to restore people's trust... But we are now at a halfway stage (as the SESC investigation has not yet finished),"" he said.
He said two company executives involved in the irregular dealings scandal resigned as managing directors as of Monday, but said they would stay at the company to help its in-house investigation into the deals.  
Industry sources said that the longer the SESC investigation lasts, the greater will be the damage to Nomura's business and reputation.
An executive at a life insurance company said: ""I was very shocked at the news as Nomura, a leading company in Japan's securities industry, seems to have repeated its wrong-doing after similar scandals (in 1991).""
Several Japanese investment management companies have suspended business dealings with Nomura in light of the scandal.
""Such business suspensions will continue at least until the SESC completes its investigation and official actions are decided upon,"" the insurance executive said.

Rentokil Initial, formed last year through Rentokil's hostile takeover of rival BET, said pre-tax profit jumped 48 percent to 318 million pounds ($505.8 million) while sales were up 168 percent at 2.34 billion pounds.
The dividend rose 20.5 percent to 5.06 pence per share.
The results were at the bottom end of analysts' forecasts of between 317 and 335 million pounds, and shares in the company fell sharply in morning trading, trading down 5.7 percent or 26 1/2 pence to 431 1/2 pence.
Rentokil Initial, whose services include office cleaning, personnel, security, pest control and supplying plants, also announced a two-for-one share split.
It said the integration of BET, bought for 2.1 billion pounds, ""had proceeded rapidly and successfully in line with plans.""
However, excluding BET, sales were up 15 percent and profits rose nine percent to 233.4 million pounds, raising concerns that the company would not have lived up to its long-established reputation for delivering year-on-year earnings and sales growth of 20 percent without BET.
One trader said ""they managed the 20 percent gain, although the contribution from BET is very substantial. People will be asking about their core businesses and wondering whether they would have made the grade without BET.""
The company said the results had been affected by 16.4 million pounds of integration costs, focusing of management effort on BET's integration and adverse exchange rates.
Chief executive Sir Clive Thompson said he did not expect the company to make any more large acquisitions for the next two years while it integrated the 52 BET operations.
""I'd be very suprised to see us making major acquisitions for certainly under two years, and if we were to do so it would indicate that we had integrated the businesses extremely well,"" Thompson said.
However, Thompson said there were opportunities for ""bolt-on acquisitions"" in the core businesses of hygiene and cleaning, pest control and security ""and I hope we'd be making those sorts of acquisitions.""
Thompson said he expected to make a number of low-key disposals of BET operations over the next year.
""In the short term you'd expect to see a series, quite a number, of relatively small-sized disposals. In total terms over the next 12 months it might approach 50 to 100 million (pounds),"" he said.

Pre-tax profits climbed to 2.964 billion pounds ($4.8 billion) from 2.505 billion ($4.04 billion), in the middle of analysts' expectations. Sales rose 9 percent to 8.341 billion pounds ($13.45 billion), and shareholders were rewarded with a 13 percent rise in the dividend to 34.0 pence.
Sales of Glaxo's gastric ulcer treatment Zantac fell 14 percent last year, but at 1.931 billion pounds ($3.1 billion) it continued to be the world's biggest-selling drug, a spot it has held since 1986. Zantac has single-handedly transformed Glaxo, which merged with rival Wellcome in 1995, into a huge international player.
Sales of its second-biggest seller, herpes treatment Zovirax, which has already lost most of its key patents, were steady at 812 million pounds ($1.3 billion).
Glaxo warned that the best it could hope for over the next two years would be to ""at least maintain"" its profits at the 1996 level.
""The tough period is mid-1997 to mid-1998 when Zantac will come under severe generic pressure in the U.S.,"" Deputy Chairman and Chief Executive Sir Richard Sykes said in a telephone interview.
But he added: ""If you take Zantac out we have a 6.4 billion pound ($10.3 billion) business growing at 14 percent. That underlying growth is a very clear indication of the strength of the group going forward.""
Sykes noted that sales of Zantac fell by 324 million pounds ($523 million) last year, while a portfolio of newer products launched since 1990 saw sales rise by 650 million pounds ($1.05 billion) to 2.0 billion pounds ($3.2 billion).
""Our responsibility is to grow those new products to maintain these two (sales) lines in balance as much as possible. It is a balancing act,"" he said.
The best performers included Glaxo Wellcome's rejuvenated HIV and AIDS treatments. Retrovir and Epivir are at the cornerstone of new cocktails of drugs that have shown startling success in reducing the levels of the virus in the blood to virtually undetectable levels, giving Glaxo Wellcome the lion's share of a rapidly expanding market.
""Today we have 57 percent of the AIDS market and I don't see why we won't continue to be a very major player,"" Sykes said.
Other big sellers included asthma drugs Serevent and Flixotide and migraine drug Imigran, whose U.S. sales leaped by 69 percent last year.
Despite persistent speculation that Glaxo Wellcome will get onto the acquisition trail again as soon as its debt levels allow, Sykes said there had been a clear dissipation of the pressures for mega-mergers. He said Glaxo Wellcome's future expansion was likely to be ""incremental.""
""The pressures of the early 1990s have changed somewhat in the big markets. The bigger companies get, the more difficult it is to buy them or merge, so the way forward will be much more looking at regional and local opportunities and building these as opportunities come along,"" he said.

3319,"Shares in British drugs company Zeneca Group Plc had another busy day on Friday as the bid rumour mill again started churning, overshadowing a key patent victory in the United States.
Zeneca shares climbed 35 pence to 18.55 pounds ($30.06) in late afternoon trading after a U.S. Appeals Court threw out a patent challenge to one of its top-selling drugs, breast cancer treatment Nolvadex.
The ruling, which follows a U.S. district court decision in Zeneca's favour a year ago, means that Canadian generic drug maker Novopharm Ltd will not be able to market a generic version of Nolvadex before Zeneca's patent runs out in 2002.
But analysts said the ruling was widely expected and pointed the finger instead at the Swiss magazine Cash for driving up Zeneca's shares.
Cash said Swiss giant Roche Holdings AG was about to announce an agreed takeover of the British group.
Stephen Putnam, analyst at Kleinwort Benson, said: ""I think this rise has more to do with rumours about a Roche bid. I can't believe anybody thought there would be a different outcome (to the Novopharm appeal).""
In an unsourced article, Cash said Roche was planing to offer between 21 and 22 pounds per share for Zeneca, which it would then break up, selling off the agricultural chemical and specialty seeds divisions as well as Roche's own fragrances and aromas division.
Both companies, increasingly weary of the mounting bid speculation, again declined to comment. But London analysts laughed the suggestion out of court.
""Frankly, for 21 pounds they'd be lucky to get the agricultural chemicals division. I think the bidding would start at 30 pounds,"" said one analyst who asked not to be identified. ""Zeneca is not interested and doesn't need to embark on a merger,"" he added.
Zeneca's patent victory against Novopharm has, however, strengthened its main attraction for any possible bidder -- its strong product portfolio.
Nolvadex is the world's top-selling breast cancer treatment, with sales of 2.7 billion pounds since its launch. Last year Zeneca sold 332 million pounds worth of Nolvadex, making it one of its biggest money spinners.
Zeneca began legal action against Novopharm in January 1995 after the Canadian company tried to get U.S. regulatory approval for a generic version of Nolvadex, also known as Tamoxifen Citrate.
Two other patent challenges for Nolvadex in the U.S, against Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc and Pharmachemie BV, are outstanding. A third, against Lemmon Co, was dropped after Lemmon withdrew its marketing application.
Kevin Scotcher, analyst at NatWest Markets, said Zeneca's patent position was now much more secure as a result of the Novopharm ruling. ""This case must strengthen their hand significantly in those other cases,"" he said.
Novopharm has been very active in legal challenges recently, last week successfully winning the right to market a generic version of one of the world's biggest-selling drugs, Glaxo Wellcome Plc's Zantac, from July.

3321,"British-based drugs group Medeva Plc said on Wednesday that the structure was now in place for further growth in the U.S. market, where the bulk of its sales and profits are made.
In a telephone interview with Reuters after publication of results for 1996, chief executive Bill Bogie said the U.S.-based Rochester business, bought last year from Rhone Poulenc Rorer Inc, was being turned into the group's ""flagship.""  
In a sign of its growing emphasis on the U.S. market, Medeva announced that all its U.S. operations would operate under the name Medeva Pharmaceuticals, and declared its intention of switching its American Depositary Receipt (ADR) listing to the New York Stock Exchange.
Bogie said the group now had ""a fully integrated sales force"" in the U.S. ""This is very important progress. Behind that you can get a national sales force, and you can add to that when you like."" He said added that the current sales force totalled 264 part- and full-time staff, but added that ""the structure is there to grow to a thousand if you want to.""  
After the acquistion of Rochester, which came with a portfolio of ten products, the proportion of operating profits contributed by U.S. operations rose to 86 percent last year from 79 percent, with sales increasing to 69 percent from 62 percent.
Bogie said he was ""very encouraged"" by the performance of the 10 Rochester products, with sales totalling $77 million in the six months of Medeva's ownership compared to $100 million in the whole of 1995. One of the strongest performers was appetite repressent Ionamin, used to treat obesity, although Medeva said sales slowed significantly at the end of 1996 following the launch of American Home Products Corp's rival Redux.  
Bogie said he expected to see ""significant and sustained growth"" from the Rochester products this year as the products emerged from relative neglect.
Finance director Garry Watts told Reuters that the decision to seek a New York Stock Exchange listing in the next two weeks reflected the strength of the U.S. business and the fact that around 35 percent of Medeva shares were held in the U.S.
""I think it is time that we were on the big board,"" he said.
Outside the U.S, Medeva is still interested in building up its position in Italy and Germany, although Bogie declined to comment on whether it had acquisitions in view.
The company said its French business had now achieved critical mass and become profitable following the addition of certain Rhone Poulenc assets there. The group has also enhanced its presence in Switzerland and Spain in the past 18 months.
Bogie said Medeva would also consider adding a sixth therapeutic category to the list of central nervous sytem, respiratory, vaccines, hospital products and gastroenterology.
""And we have opportunites in biotech where we are seen increasingly as a company that understands biotech,"" he said. Medeva has alliances with Chiroscience Group Plc, Peptide Therapeutics Plc and ML Laboratories Plc.
Bogie said Medeva continued to see behaviour-controlling drug Methylphenidate as a ""long-term opportunity"" despite the likelihood of increased competition this year from rival products.
The drug, given largely to children and young adults, continues to be the main profit engine for Medeva, andd saw sales rise 25 percent last year to 108 million stg.

3322,"British textiles group Coats Viyella Plc is ""well placed"" for a recovery in profitablity, its retiring chief executive Neville Bain said on Thursday.
Bain told Reuters in an interview following publication of results that showed a sharp fall in 1996 profits: ""We are poised for a period of growth from the base we have put in place."" He added, ""The company is well placed to move ahead in 1997 and future years, although the extent of that does depend on some factors outside our control,"" including exchange rates and economic trends.  
Bain said he felt now was the right time to stand down as chief executive after 6-1/2 years, and added that he hoped to take up other directorships and chairmanships.
""We agreed at the end of last year that this would be a good time to go,"" Bain said.
He said he would continue to be available to assist Coats Viyella. Bain said his successor, former McKechnie Plc chief executive Michael Ost, ""has a very good track record, and he did not expect him to change the group's strategy.  
""This year's results, in difficult circumstances, are exactly in line with expectations and the trading statement that we made at the end of last year,"" said Bain. ""Underlying profit is down by seven percent, which is a tad disappointing, but given the state of this industry that certainly would augur well in (comparison with) our peer group.""
Bain said cost savings from the group's reorganisation, which led to charges of 54.9 million stg against 1996 profits, were flowing through faster than expected. Savings in 1996 totalled 12 million pounds against a prediction of 10 million stg.  
Bain said he was ""confident"" that savings of at least 35 million stg would be achieved in 1998.
He highlighted the performance of the group's home furnishings division, where operating profits rose 42 percent to 12.5 mllion stg, and the continued strength of fashion retail, which he said had built profits to 13.1 million stg in 1996 from around 2.0 million over the past five years.
But he said the performance of clothing, where profits fell 12 percent to 19.1 million stg, ""was not satisfactory."" He said the division had been affected by disruption from restructuring, which involves relocation of a number of operations.  
Bain said he was confident management ""is doing the right things to secure greater profits into the future, but it is taking us a bit longer than anticipated."" He added that group was looking for a ""significant improvement"" on the division's profit margins of between three and four percent.
The core threads division, where operating profits fell 10.4 percent to 90.3 million stg, had enjoyed a stronger fourth quarter after a weak first half, Bain said.

3324,"Textiles group Coats Viyella Plc, reporting lower first-half results, said on Wednesday it is confident it is on course for a bounce back to profit growth in 1997 as it puts a restructuring behind it.
The first 17.2 million pound chunk of reorganisation costs announced in March caused first-half pretax profit to tumble 34 percent to 47 million pounds ($73.09 million), with the remaining 38 million pounds of costs all to be charged against second-half earnings.
Chief executive Neville Bain told Reuters that ""charges will be taken this year so 1997 will be put on a clean basis going forward"" and predicted ""a good return to profit"" next year.
The announcement from Coats, whose products range from bath towels to precision engineering components, ended uncertainty about how the charges would fall.
An upbeat statement about prospects in key markets, in contrast with the gloomier tone of some competitors, helped to boost Coats' shares by 4-1/2 pence to 164 pence by late morning.
Bain said he is confident the group will achieve its cumulative annual cost saving targets of 10 million pounds in the second half of 1996, 25 million pounds in 1997 and 35 million in 1998.
But he said not all of this will reach the bottom line as the group spends money shifting an increasing amount of clothing production to lower-cost areas such as Morocco, eastern Europe and parts of Asia.
The reorganisation involves shedding 7,750 jobs, including nearly 3,000 in Britain.
Rival Courtaulds Textiles Plc announced on Tuesday that it is belatedly following Coats' lead in looking abroad to tackle continued margin pressures.
Coats' first-half operating profits on continuing operations slipped to 78.0 million pounds from 87.3 million, largely due to declines at its threads division, which produces thread for sewing and knitting and is the world's second-biggest zipper maker.
Bain said the decline was ""largely due to Brazil and Turkey in the first-half of 1995 having exceptional levels of profits. We said at the time that was unsustainable.""
Coats expects a ""worthwhile"" improvement in second-half results year-on-year before charges, with the key September to December period accounting for half its annual profits.
It said trading conditions ""appear to be showing some signs of improvement"", with a return of consumer confidence in Britain and normal weather patterns expected to help the second-half.
Bain said there was continued progress at its Jaeger and Viyella fashion retail chains, and the group's home furnishings business is struggling to keep up with demand caused by a ""substantial"" pick-up in the British housing market.
""The USA is picking up and we think it will good to us, especially in threads and engineering,"" Bain added, while demand in the rest of Europe is expected to remain mixed. ($1=.6430 Pound)

3332,"Young drug discovery group Vanguard Medica Plc said on Thursday it could wait longer than expected before seeking a fresh cash injection.
Vanguard floated on the stock exchange in May, raising 46.4 million stg to fund its pipeline, which includes migraine and kidney failure drugs.
""We said we'd be expecting to seek more finance in 1998, but we took in more money than we'd expected and may have scope for going on longer,"" commercial director Nick Heightman said in a telephone interview following interim results.  
Vanguard said on Thursday that its pretax loss in the six months to June 30 widened to 3.7 million stg from 1.8 million a year earlier, largely due to the cost of moving migraine drug VML 251 and anti-inflammatory drug VML 295 through trials.
Heightman, who joined Vanguard from drug giant Glaxo Wellcome Plc, said the company had expected to announce results of large-scale intermediate, or Phase II, trials on the migraine drug by July 1997.
""I think we are going to be able to do that in the first quarter, so we are about a quarter ahead,"" he said.  
Analysts say the migraine drug, which is being developed in cooperation with SmithKline Beecham Plc accounts for around half of Vanguard's current stock market valuation.
Some studies have shown it may be more potent than the current market leader, Glaxo Wellcome's Imigran, although Heightman said direct comparisons cannot be made for another 18 months.
He said another Vanguard drug, VML 252, which promises to tackle bone damage suffered by patients with severe kidney problems, is now ""running neck and neck"" with the migraine treatment.  
Although VDL 252 is currently in Phase I trials, Heightman said it is likely to progress more quickly through trials than the migraine drug.
""Its effectiveness is particularly easy to measure. You can quickly tell if you are having an effect,"" he told Reuters. Heightman believes both drugs could be on the market in the year 2000 if trials continue to go well.
Despite the positive news from the company, Vanguard shares dropped 5 1/2 pence to 495 pence on Thursday.  
Greig Middleton analyst Julia Dickson expressed surprise at the fall, saying the market ""doesn't seem to understand the company.""
""We think it is very cheap and I am surprised it is off,"" Dickson said, adding that the company's statement was ""very positive"" and Vanguard's meeting with analysts on Thursday showed drugs are progressing even faster than the company has officialy acknowledged.
Lehman Brothers' analyst Ian Smith said the ""share price adequately reflects the value of the current portfolio, with some excellent opportunities,"" particualrly in migraine and kidney-related problems.
He said in the medium- to long-term, the value will depend on Vanguard's ability to attract further partnerships like that with SmithKline Beecham, a cornerstone of Vanguard's growth strategy.

3335,"Tiny Scottish research company Shield Diagnostics Plc said on Monday it had moved closer to marketing a potentially world-beating test for predicting heart attacks and coronary heart disease.
Shield said studies showed that patients with coronary heart disease had 30 percent higher levels of a key clotting agent, Activated Factor Twelve (AFT), in their blood than healthy people.
Dundee-based Shield has developed the only known test for AFT, the first element in a cascade of reactions in the blood which can eventually result in heart attacks and heart disease.
It believes this will prove a much more accurate indicator of both conditions than the 500 million pounds worth of cholesterol tests taken every year.
Shares in Shield closed 40 pence higher at 690 pence, to show a net gain of 393 percent since the start of the year.
However, they continued to trade below the all-time peak of 928 pence reached just before news of problems with a patient-monitoring trial in the United States unnerved some investors on March 14.
The company says problems with the U.S. trial, which has monitored incidence of heart atacks in 16,000 people for more than a decade, would not affect the timetable for launching a general screening test and a simple test kit for use in doctor's surgeries.
Shield said it planned to make the test itself and then license it out on a semi-exclusive basis to large diagnostic companies and to drug companies who would use it to promote their products.
Talks with diagnostics companies, believed to include Abbott Laboratories Inc, are already under way.
Shield declined to predict sales for the test but said it could save health services and insurers hundreds of millions of pounds a year through earlier detection and prevention.
Chief executive officer Gordon Hall said caring for patients with cardiac disase in the United States alone cost $151 billion a year, including $118 billion on hospital care.
""Any process than can reduce this figure must be highly attractive to healthcare providers ...if five percent of cases were detected earlier and prevented, then over $7.5 billion could be saved,"" Hall said.
For now Shield is more than content to have its eye not just on the 500 million pound annual cholesterol test market but on a further 380 million pounds spent on other tests related to cardiovascular disease.
Yamaichi International analyst Erling Refsum, a long-standing supporter of Shield, said he calculates that every one percent gain in Shield's share of the cholesterol testing market is worth 60 million pounds on its market capitalization. Even after its price surge this year, the group is worth around 130 million pounds.
However, Shield continued to try to dampen more feverish expectations about the test's prospects on Monday.
""All we can say is that if you have high AFT, you are a high risk (of a heart attack),"" said technical director Peter Foster. ""We can't say that if you have low AFT there is no risk -- there may be other reasons (for a heart attack).""
Shield's caution may also stem from press and market criticism in recent week of the way it has handled news about the product.
One industry specialist said many investors had not been getting a straight story on the AFT test, leading to the share's underperformance last year.
The company ran into trouble in January when it published a newsletter on AFT which was not initially sent to the stock exchange. The newsletter sparked a sharp rise in the group's share price.

3360,"Illegal mobile phone use across the Chinese border is continuing to interrupt air traffic control communications with airline pilots flying in and out of Hong Kong but cross-border action to try and solve the problem appears to be working, industry sources told Reuters.
The Hong Kong Aircrew Officers' Association said Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) is a persistent problem with pilots complaining of a loud buzzing in their ears which forces them to quickly change to another frequency to maintain contact with air traffic control.
Hong Kong's Kai Tak is already regarded as one of the world's most difficult airports to land at, and the sources say RFI is an unwelcome addition to a pilot's workload. RFI is widely blamed on mobile phones and pagers being used on illegal frequencies in neighbouring Guangdong province.
One Hong Kong-based Boeing 747 freighter pilot, who did not want to be identified, said the problem caused safety concerns.
""It happened to me the other day just after take-off. But the interference is not consistent and they seem to have a problem in tracking it down. It means we sometimes get incomplete radio messages which causes a headache when you least need it. It takes time to change to the back-up frequency and at peak times the airwaves are very crowded. I know of quite a few captains who have filed an occurrence report because of the safety issue involved,"" he said.
The aircrew officers' association general secretary, John Findlay, agreed RFI was a concern but said remedial action appeared to be working.
""It has been a problem but pilots I've been speaking to say the situation has very much improved recently,"" he said.
In a statement, the Hong Kong government's Civil Aviation Department said RFI had been under ""urgent investigation"" by the territory's Office of Telecommunications Authority (OFTA) which had been liaising with the relevant authorities in China.
""It is understood that a team has been established in China to tackle the RFI issue. It appears recently that the extent of RFI has been reduced and the situation is being closely monitored. With assistance from the Chinese authorities, it is anticipated that the RFI problem could eventually be eliminated,"" the statement said.
The department also said it had deployed spare back-up frequencies as interim replacements when RFI occurred and until the effect on air traffic operations was overcome.
OFTA said in a statement it expected its counterpart in China, the Guangdong Radio Management Committee Office, to take urgent action to remove the interference, and that some channels had already been cleared.

3372,"Cathay Pacific Airways Limited is the first airline to test fly a new 'sharks skin' aircraft coating which could reduce fuel costs and revolutionise air travel, a Cathay spokeswoman told Reuters.
One of Cathay's four Airbus A340-300 aircraft has been partly covered by transparent, plastic adhesive foils containing fine ridges or riblets which resemble the texture of sharks' skin.
The spokeswoman said scientists discovered that sharks swim faster because their skin is covered in fine ridges running lengthwise along their bodies which reduces drag.
She said Airbus Industrie hope the streamlining principle can be transferred to aircraft, reducing the amount of fuel burned by up to one percent.
Over an aircraft's lifetime, the fuel bill saving could be huge at a time when rising fuel prices are a highly topical subject.
Airbus said it has already been conducting trials for several years with the U.S. manufacturer 3M but Cathay is the first scheduled airline to apply the latest technology, higher durability film.
Cathay passengers flying on long haul routes to Rome, Zurich, Toronto and Melbourne will not notice unless they look very closely at the fuselage and the differing destinations will offer a testing environment for the coating, the spokeswoman added.
""It is a very interesting development for Cathay to be involved in and anything that helps to cut the cost of fuel will be extremely welcome to us and the whole industry,"" the spokeswoman said.
She said the experiment is expected to last between one and five years with Airbus and 3M engineers visiting the aircraft for regular checks. Cathay's Flight Planning and Performance Department engineers will also be monitoring its performance, she said.

Tseng told Reuters in an interview, that he expects the new service will be slowly built up after initial flights on December 20 and 29.
""The first two flights were a combination of local cargo supported by cargo from Hong Kong and topped up in Bangkok so it was shared by three hubs which we are using to slowly build up the Guangzhou service.""
""You have to remember Guangzhou is nothing compared to Hong Kong which is the traditional entry point.

3374,"Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (HACTL) said its new SuperTerminal 1 will be only 50 percent operational when Hong Kong's new Chek Lap Kok(CLK) airport is due to open in April 1998.
HACTL managing director Anthony Charter told reporters during a construction site visit to the facility -- now about 25 percent complete -- that meeting the Airport Authority's opening deadline date was causing major concerns.
The new cargo terminal is due to cost HK$7.8 billion and is planned to be the world's biggest air cargo facility.
""It's a tall order when you see the size of the building. We will have something ready in April 1998, although we are not contractually due to open until August. The builders are working under severe pressure and we are doing our best but whether we will be able to cope in April, I cannot say,"" Charter said.
""If the airport opens in April we will have 50 percent of capacity available but 75 percent from June 30,"" Charter said.
SuperTerminal 1 is expected to be able to handle 1.2 million tonnes a year from June 1998 which is less than the 1.5 million tonnes Kai Tak handles now and does not take into account growth rates. A second, smaller cargo terminal is also being built.
Industry sources said it is vital that the cargo complex, one of the most technologically advanced of its kind, works perfectly on opening to prevent a logistical nightmare and an enormous traffic jam at the HK$49.8 billion new airport.
It is currently planned to close Kai Tak and open the new airport the following morning but Charter said he would like to see a ""soft"" opening to ensure a smooth start.
That could mean some cargo aircraft using the new airport during the night to test the highly automated cargo handling systems.
He also raised the possibility of Kai Tak remaining open while CLK gradually built up. A 24 hour embargo on cargo being delivered to the new facility might also have to be imposed, he added.
There had also been a two month delay to an already very tight schedule because of problems with concrete form work by the main contractor, Charter said.
An industry source told Reuters that the infamous baggage handling delays suffered by Denver's new airport showed how vital it was that everything work before opening.
He said it was rare for a new airport to open on time and increasing financial and political pressure was being put on contractors to ensure the opening deadline for CLK was met.

The removal has been made by nearly all the airlines who originally imposed it and comes after a warning from the Hong Kong government that surcharges cannot be imposed nor rates lifted without government approval.
To add to what observers say is a confusing situation, one of the territory's biggest carriers - Lufthansa Cargo - said it is not withdrawing the surcharge. The airline's general manager in Hong Kong, Frank Berweger, said he does not think a surcharge is illegal.
""We still believe that it is legal. We are showing on the airway bill that there is an extra charge which will be dropped when the price of fuel comes down again. We are still in discussion with the CAD about what happens next,"" Berweger said.
The 80 Hong Kong cents a kilo surcharge was informally agreed by some carriers earlier this month to compensate for jet fuel prices which they said had leapt by around 50 per cent between July and October.
The Hong Kong Shippers' Council, an umbrella organisation representing trade bodies, freight forwarders and business leaders, protested to the Government that any surcharge is illegal unless it is first approved by the Civil Aviation Department.
A department spokeswoman said they had investigated the issue and sent a warning letter to airlines reminding them that permission to impose a surcharge must be obtained first.
Alitalia, KLM, Martinair and Cargolux said they quickly heeded the warning.
""We have withdrawn the surcharge after the warning. Instead we are putting up our rate to compensate for the much higher cost of fuel,"" said a spokesman for Alitalia cargo in Hong Kong. No details of such an increase have yet been published.
A spokesman for Dutch cargo airline Martinair said it would abide by the proper procedure and also withdraw the surcharge. But he said rates may be increased to compensate.
A Cargolux spokesman said the situation was confusing but it had agreed to also withdraw the surcharge.
Hong Kong Shippers' Council Executive Director Clement Yeung said he was pleased the surcharge had been mainly withdrawn but the situation is ""certainly confusing.""
""Some airlines are sticking to their guns but we believe that they should go by the book. Imposing surcharges sets a precedent which we do not want to see. If airlines now want to raise their published rates instead then we cannot complain about that,"" Yeung said.

The imposition by airlines of an 80 Hong Kong cents a kilo fuel surcharge has caused controversy in the territory. Following complaints from the Hong Kong Shippers' Council, which also represents freight forwarders, the Civil Aviation Department (CAD) wrote warning letters asking airlines to withdraw the surcharge. Some did but Bour said Air France, Lufthansa Cargo, Swissair, Air Hong Kong and Thai Airways International have refused.
He told Reuters, "" we are fighting with the CAD because they are saying it is totally illegal, but we don't have the same point of view. I am saying it is not a rate increase but a fuel surcharge, which is something totally different. I understand perfectly well that we are not allowed to increase the official rate without referring to the CAD, but when are talking about market rate plus a fuel surcharge we are still far below the official rate. We can play around with the market rates and the fuel surcharge will remain,"" Bour explained.
The average rate from Hong Kong to Europe is between HK$23-24 per kilo with a fuel surcharge of 80 HK cents or 10 US cents which restores the rate to last year's level, Bour said. He said the fuel surcharge is not a blanket application, express cargo and cargo with airway bills containing the published rate is exempt.
Bour said the argument had been referred to the French civil aviation department, which has been in touch with the Hong Kong government.

A memory bank contains a complete catalogue of all possible container contours and exact dimensions of each individual aircraft which use HACTL.
If the shape fits, the computer identifies the container as ""good to go"" and allows it to continue its journey. If the shape does not conform, the computer rejects it, long before handlers struggle to try to squeeze it into an aircraft, Yueng said.
""It's a very simple idea which can speed up the truck dock procedures and increase the reliability of container reception. It ensures there are no delays and every aircraft takes off with its intended load,"" Yueng said.
HACTL intends to test the prototype during the second quarter of this year at Kai Tak, continuously refine the design and implement the final design at the company's SuperTerminal One complex now under construction at Hong Kong's new airport.
Yeung, who is credited by observers as playing a leading role in developing HACTL's renowned computerised handling technology, said the new development could eventually be marketed to other air cargo operators around the world.
The cost of developing the new system has not been disclosed.

3392,"The decision by Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd to buy three more Airbus Industrie A340 long range aircraft will increase the airline's air cargo opportunities, according to a senior Cathay cargo executive.
Ray Jewell, cargo marketing and sales manager for Cathay Pacific Cargo, told Reuters in an interview that the new aircraft will be able to fly between 15 and 17 tonnes of belly space cargo plus passengers in normal weather conditions from Hong Kong to Toronto.
Other possible destinations for the new aircraft from Hong Kong to Europe are still being studied, he added. The A340's ability to fly ultra-long distances will mean some existing routes become non stop destinations, Jewell said.
""These new aircraft will certainly help us on the air cargo side of things, there is no question about that. We are very pleased with our existing A340s which are very cargo friendly and fuel-efficient along with our Boeing 777s,"" Jewell said.
Cathay currently have four A340-200 and three A340-300 in its fleet.
The new Airbus A340-300 models are due to be delivered in the second and third quarters of 1998 to coincide with the opening of Hong Kong's new airport at Chek Lap Kok and increased flight schedules.
""Chek Lap Kok will definitely open things up for us and for other airlines which at the moment are restricted for slots at Kai Tak. The new airport is a major factor in planning and strategy. The increased cargo opportunities go hand in hand,"" Jewell added.

3394,"The International Air Transport Association (IATA) said on Tuesday it supports plans for a single air traffic control centre to cover all airports in the fast growing Pearl River delta region in southern China.
IATA director general Pierre Jeanniot told the Hong Kong International Aerospace Forum that all three existing air traffic service providers in Hong Kong, China and Macau had indicated acceptance of the concept after a recent meeting in Guangzhou.
Jeanniot told Reuters after his speech that all airlines would benefit from a unified air traffic control through lower costs, faster transit times for overflights and reduced pilot workload.
However he could give no timescale for when the concept might be introduced, where an overall centre would be based or how much it would cost.
""Three air traffic control centres can be very inefficient and potentially dangerous. It is at a busy cross roads and it is important that local capacity is coordinated. There is agreement now that it would be better if control was integrated. The concept has been agreed in principle that it needs to be done. Discussions are ongoing,"" Jeanniot said.
Air traffic is continuously increasing in the Pearl River delta region with large airports at Guangzhou and Shenzhen and new airports at Zhuhai and in the nearby Portuguese enclave of Macau.
Also within a few minutes flying time is one of the world's busiest airports in Hong Kong at Kai Tak, which will be replaced in 1998 by Chek Lap Kok airport offering even more capacity, industry sources said

3403,"Toronto's key stock index rocketed almost 100 points higher on Friday as earnings euphoria soared and fears of a U.S. interest rate hike waned.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index climbed 97.01 points to 6106.91 and extended its winning streak to a fourth day.
Trading in Canada's largest equities market totaled 109 million shares worth C$2.2 billion ($1.6 billion).
""All of a sudden people are coming back to rational expectations,"" said Calgary, Alberta-based portfolio manager Josef Schachter. ""Earnings have been fantastic.""
Stock market gains in Toronto and New York were also powered by news of a long-awaited agreement between the White House and congressional Republican leaders to balance the U.S. budget, Schachter said.
A balanced U.S. budget means the government will offer fewer bonds, boosting demand and prices for fixed income instruments and reducing yields.
There were also growing expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve would not hike interest rates at its May 20 meeting since this week's U.S. economic data pointed to minimal inflation growth.
This week, Toronto's key index jumped by almost five percent as strong corporate earnings rolled in.
Of Toronto's 14 sub-indices, 12 rose on Friday, including media, utilities, consumer products and banks. Real estate and gold groups slipped.
Advancing issues led decliners 616 to 358, while 254 were unchanged.
In individual issues, telecommunications conglomerate BCE Inc. jumped 4.20 to 69.95. Cable and telephone companies were active after the federal Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission on Thursday threw the country's local telephone market open to competition.
The government telecommunications watchdog also came out in favor of convergence between the phone and cable television broadcast industries.

Canada's largest equities market also posted its heaviest trading session and highest value ever, with 169.4 million shares traded worth C$2.97 billion ($2.18 billion).
Despite the drop, the 300 index did not cross the key support mark of 6175 points, said portfolio consultant Ron Meisels. ""We're still actually very much above the break-out level,"" he said.
Toronto's losses were checked by a soaring gold group, which rocketed 3.23 percent on surging bullion price on COMEX. April gold closed $5.00 higher an ounce at $352.70.

""We've had a very strong year,"" Zambonini said of fiscal 1997 ended February 28. He added in an interview on Monday that 1998 would also be ""a big year.""
Ottawa-based Cognos makes software to analyze business database information via sophisticated spreadsheets.
""We have six new products and versions coming out in the first quarter,"" Zambonini said.
Zambonini said that Cognos, whose revenues grew 34 percent to US$51.3 million in the 1997 third quarter ended November 30, was considering how to use its cash hoard of more than US$100 million, he said.
Cognos' net earnings for the first nine months of fiscal 1997 rose to US$23.5 million or US$0.51 a share from year earlier US$10.1 million or US$0.23 a share.
""We think when it's accretive, it makes sense to use our cash,"" Zambonini said.
""We're actively looking right now for other products,"" he said. In early February, Cognos said it acquired London-based Right Information Systems Ltd, a business modeling and forecasting software developer, for $8 million in cash and stock.
He added that Cognos planned to expand operations in Europe, especially in Germany, Italy and Scandinavia.
A buyback of up to five percent of shares was another option, since the stock had taken a beating on Nasdaq and the Toronto Stock Exchange since late last year, Zambonini said.
Investors sold off after an analyst downgraded Cognos to a hold from a buy, saying the stock reached his target price in early December.
Cognos shares were up 0.20 to 32.75 in Toronto on Tuesday, down from a 52-week high of 53.50. Cognos was unchanged at 24-1/8 on Nasdaq, versus a 52-week high of about 39.

The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index plummeted 191.21 points to 5931.63, the biggest loss since October 20, 1987, the day after so-called Black Monday when it lost 220.90 points.
Gold prospector Bre-X resumed trading late on Thursday, plunging C$13 to C$2.50 on eight million shares after the company said on Wednesday's its Busang gold find, once touted as the world's largest, may not be as rich as projected.
""It's pretty obvious that Bre-X blew a hole in the market,"" said John Ing president of Maison Placements Canada of Toronto. ""It's...the shock and the ripple effect of the Bre-X disaster.""
Investors unloaded their Bre-X shares after trading resumed Thursday afternoon, wiping C$3.12 billion ($2.26 million) from the company's market value. The stock was halted on Wednesday.
On Nasdaq, Bre-X shares plummeted $9-13/32 to $1-31/32 on trading of nearly 6.9 million shares.
Investors seemed unconvinced after Bre-X chief executive David Walsh declared he was confident of the company's reserve estimates for its discovery deep in Indonesia's jungle.
Bre-X's partner Freeport McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc. said on Wednesday its preliminary studies showed the site turned up ""insignificant amounts of gold."" Bre-X has estimated the Busang deposit contains 71 million ounces of gold.
During the selloff, the Toronto Stock Exchange's computer systems were halted twice, forcing the market to close half an hour early due to ""technical difficulties,"" an official said.
Worries about other junior mining firms swept the market, sparking a massive retreat in the heavyweight gold sector.
The gold group sank 906.93 points, or 8.66 percent, to close at 9559.92 -- its biggest one-day drop since September 7, 1993 when the sector lost nearly 10 percent of its value.

""We will have to vacate a number of stores over time. But it is too early to predict the future of specific stores or any other measures that may be taken,"" Eaton's President George Eaton said.
The 127-year-old Toronto-based firm, which has estimated annual sales of C$1.25 billion ($912 million), said it arranged financing of C$555 million ($405 million) from an unspecified major financial institution.
The chain, which is owned by the Eatons, one of Canada's richest families, said it filed for a court order to continue the operations of its retailing division, while negotiating a restructuring plan.
Canadian department stores have lost market share in recent years due to a weak economy and the invasion of U.S. discounter Wal-Mart Stores Inc. in 1994.
Eaton's has about 90 outlets across Canada.
""About half of the stores will go...I think it'll be around about 40,"" predicted analyst John Winter of John Winter Associates Ltd in Toronto.
""As in most bankruptcy reorganizations, they're just going to close a large number of stores they shouldn't have opened in the first place and that will stanch the red ink.""
Eaton's parent, Eaton Group of Companies, sold some of its real estate holdings in recent years, including properties worth about C$300 million ($219 million) a year ago.

3453,"Alcohol and tobacco companies are capitalising on the Internet's popularity and flashy graphics to promote products in cyberspace in ways that appeal to underage youth, said a report issued Thursday.
The Centre for Media Education (CME), a children's advocacy group, called on Congress, federal regulators and health officials to probe the promotions, saying some may be illegal. The Federal Trade Commission already is probing television liquor and beer ads.
""Urgent action is needed to ensure that effective safeguards are put in place to protect young people from the harmful effects of online marketing of alcohol and tobacco,"" said the report.
""Many of these new forms of advertising, of particular appeal to youth, appear to be inherently unfair and deceptive."" Industry officials deny they are targeting youth.
""There's nothing on the Budweiser Web site that a family wouldn't see on an Anheuser-Busch brewery tour,"" countered Jack Dougherty, spokesman for Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. BUD.N , which produces Budweiser beer. He said the company's Web site targets beer drinkers age 21 and older.
The study said alcoholic beverage companies, in particular, have moved to establish sites on the World Wide Web, the multimedia portion of the Internet. It said more than 35 major brands are represented, including Moet &amp; Chandon champagne, Smirnoff's vodka, Dewars scotch whiskey, Samuel Adams beer, Captain Morgan rum, and other products.
The study cited marketing and promotion techniques that use the colourful, interactive features of the Web in ways that appeal to young people. It identified the following:
-- The Budweiser online radio network, ""KBUD,"" which weaves music, rock-star interviews, and music reviews together with beer promotions.
-- Web sites offering interactive games that feature brand characters, including Molson Breweries' ""Berserk in Banff"" and Jose Cuervo tequila's ""J.C. Roadhog Adventure."" Molson is owned 40 percent by Molson Cos. Ltd.  MOLa.TO, 40 percent by Foster's Brewing Group Ltd., and 20 percent by Philip Morris Cos. Inc.
The Cuervo site involves an off-road ride with a ""cyberrodent"" who drives across a desert strewn with empty tequila bottles and other Curevo merchandising icons.
-- Liquor sites with ""bridge drink"" recipes that disguise alcohol's taste and are more appealing to novice drinkers.
-- Numerous sites offering wine, beer, distilled spirits and tobacco products for sale with few or no questions asked.
Regulatory curbs and fears of political backlash have kept most big tobacco companies from launching advertising Web sites, according to the study. But that may change, it added.
Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., a subsidiary of B.A.T Industries Plc, recently began running print ads for its Lucky Strike cigarettes in the San Francisco area in a bid to entice new visitors to the Web site for ""Circuit Breaker,"" an online magazine that collects data on smoking habits and offers free T-shirts.
Brown &amp; Williamson, in response, said the Web site ""promotes awareness of events in the San Francisco Bay Area, such as bar nights and adult-oriented concerts.""
""The Web site does not contain tobacco advertising or cigarette logos because we're promoting awareness of the events, not cigarettes,"" the company added.
The study also said some tobacco companies have launched Web sites in other countries, such as Germany, that can be accessed easily from the United States.
""The cigarette industry should refrain from moving onto the Internet to market and promote its products,"" said the CME's Jeffrey Chester. ""If companies fail to comply with the Cigarette Act, appropriate legal action should be taken.""
The 1971 law bars cigarette ads on TV and radio and, according to the CME, is applicable to the Internet.

3454,"Regulators want more time to overhaul the vast web of subsidies that keeps phone service affordable, creating a new obstacle in their efforts to spawn new competition and lower prices in the telephone business.
Federal Communications Commission and industry officials said Tuesday the FCC is running into difficulties calculating the multi-billion dollar cost of paying for ""universal"" phone service to rural and other high-cost communities.
""We've been working hard for a year to try and reconcile this,"" said FCC Chief Economist Joseph Farrell. ""It would be a mistake to hurry it and do it wrong.""
Last year's communications law set a May 8 deadline for the FCC to tally the costs and to lay out a plan for a new fund to bankroll the subsidies. Phone carriers are supposed to pay for the fund.
FCC Chairman Reed Hundt told the Wall Street Journal he wants to implement key provisions next year and use an interim plan in the meantime.
The FCC will work with state regulators to determine the costs of the subsidies.
Industry analysts and officials say the new uncertainty is likely to deter phone companies from rushing to compete in new areas of business or upgrade their existing lines of business.
""We need to know what the rules of the game are before we're willing to commit a lot of money to new projects,"" said Robert Blau, BellSouth Corp. vice president.
Schwab Washington Research Group analyst Scott Cleland put it this way, ""When the playing field remains clouded, prudent competitors don't rush into the fog.""
The phone business already has a huge cloud overhanging it after a U.S. appeals court last fall suspended a key FCC order designed to break open the $100 billion local phone market to long-distance carriers and other new competitors.
The FCC is trying to calculate the size of the universal service subsidies and make them explicit, as stipulated by the telecommunications law. Estimates range anywhere from $5 billion to $20 billion.
The existing subsidies are buried in the $23 billion in charges that long-distance companies such as AT&amp;T Corp. now pay to access the local phone network.
The FCC's desire to take more time on universal service has raised concern and questions among lawmakers anxious to ensure competition takes root after passage of the telecommunications law.
""If one of the implications (of the added time) is that it does delay competition, it's a problem for us,"" said Representative W.J. Billy Tauzin, a Louisiana Republican.
""We're beginning to see some concerns about rising phone rates and cable rates. And we're beginning to be asked at town meetings when we're going to see the benefits of this highly touted deregulatory act.""
Meanwhile, the FCC's Hundt does want to proceed with one prized piece of universal service -- a $2.3 billion plan to link schools and libraries to the Internet at discounted rates.
But Tauzin worries that Hundt, in his desire to keep basic phone rates from rising, will expand obligations under universal service ""that somebody is going to have to pay for.""

3455,"Plans for a new type of radio service that could be heard coast-to-coast faced a potential new snag Monday after a top regulator said any company should be allowed to bid for the two available licenses.
Federal Communications Commission Chairman Reed Hundt said he opposed an existing FCC plan to limit a government auction of the licenses to the four applicants that filed with the agency several years ago. The agency is split over the matter.
""The auction should be open to anyone who thinks they can make a business out of"" Digital Audio Radio Service (DARS), he told a meeting of the National Association of Broadcasters.
An open auction could net the government a tidy sum.
Hundt noted that MCI Communications Corp. last year paid $683 million to win the last remaining satellite slot to beam television programmes nationwide.
The four DARS applicants are: CD Radio Inc. ; American Mobile Radio Corp., a unit of American Mobile Satellite Corp. ; Digital Broadcast Satellite Corp.; and Primosphere.
""We're not pleased to have heard (Hundt's) remark this morning,"" said CD Radio Chairman David Margolese. But he cautioned, ""We can't read too much into it just yet.""
An American Mobile Radio spokeswoman said the company hoped the FCC would limit the applicants to the current four. She also said the company hoped the four would have the chance to decide how to allocate the two licenses ""rather than go to auction.""
Unlike conventional radio, the new digitally based radio service would offer listeners CD-quality sound and would be broadcast nationwide via satellite.
Listeners would have to purchase a special radio and antenna. It is likely the service will be subscription-based.
Aside from Hundt, Commissioner Susan Ness also favours opening the auction. But she is willing to back the existing plan, if necessary, to allow the FCC to move forward promptly.
The FCC's other two commissioners -- James Quello and Rachelle Chong -- oppose opening the auction.
Chong last week publicly called on her colleagues to move as quickly as possible to complete action on the matter.
The auction issue is the latest controversy to dog the new radio service, which the FCC has been mulling for years.
The four commissioners already were split over whether to require digital audio radio service operators to meet specific public-interest obligations in return for the radio licenses -- much as TV stations now do. The FCC plan faced delays last fall after members of Congress voiced their own concerns.

3459,"A year after the ValuJet Inc. crash, the top airline regulator suggested Thursday it would be impractical to force air carriers to install fire-safety equipment in passenger cargo holds in less than three years.
Under fire for not moving more quickly to promote airline safety, the Federal Aviation Administration plans next month to propose the installation of smoke detectors and fire supressers in all passenger cargo holds over three years.
House lawmakers, however, accused the agency of dragging its feet on the installation issue, despite years of warnings from safety regulators on the need to do so. Lawmakers raised the possibility of a speedier timetable.
""It could be done in a very short period of time if we want to ground the fleet,"" Barry Valentine, acting head of the Federal Aviation Administration, told a House panel.
""That's the decision. How much disruption do we citizens want to have in our air transportation,"" he said.
But Representative John Fox, a Pennsylvania Republican, responded, ""I think we want to have as safe as flights as possible. And if they have to be a little slower, the public probably would like them to be a little slower.""
Airline executives on Wednesday announced plans to place both smoke detectors and fire-suppression systems in their aircraft, after initially balking at the dual requirement.
FAA officials came under attack at the hearing -- from both lawmakers and the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board -- for not moving more aggressively to implement new safety rules in the wake of the ValuJet crash.
""This is pathetic. The FAA is pathetic. The industry is pathetic,"" said Representative Peter DeFazio, an Oregon Democrat. ""Any more needless deaths and we're going to crucify you.""
The FAA announced six months ago plans to issue the fire-safety equipment rules, which will affect about 3,000 aircraft. But it has yet to unveil a formal proposal.
""Six months from now are we going to come back and be in the same situation that we're in today? Or is there really going to be improvement this time?"" asked Representative John Duncan, a Tennessee Republican who heads the transporation subcommittee.
Valentine responded that in six months the rules would be in the ""final assembly.""
ValuJet flight 592 crashed into the Florida Everglades last May, killing 110 people, because of a fire in the cargo hold. Oxygen generators were blamed for the fire. Regulators have since banned their transport on commercial airliners.
The head of the NTSB disclosed this week, however, that Continental Airlines last month unknowingly carried a shipment of generators similar to those in the ValuJet accident.
NTSB Chairman Jim Hall also complained at the hearing that the FAA had been slow to inform his agency of the Continental incident. Hall said it was reported to the FAA on April 24.
""It did not come to the attention of our agency until this week. You would think that in light of the ValuJet accident that if someone knew that something like this had taken place, that that information would be extremely important to the flying public of the United States,"" Hall said.
An FAA spokesman later said the FAA is under no requirement to forward such information to the NTSB.

3460,"Congress is gearing up to try and make changes to the way the government auctions the airwaves, following a recent sale that fell flat and a new Justice Department investigation into possible bid-rigging.
Lawmakers said Thursday they are eyeing bills or offering legislation to maximize the money the federal government raises through spectrum sales. That comes after some wireless communications licenses auctioned last week feteched just $1 apiece, and the antitrust probe put a further tarnish on the sales.
Bills being offered would set minimum bidding levels or slow the flow of airwave slices into the market by holding federal auctions only at selected intervals. The Clinton administration is studying the measures.
Congress has relied heavily on the Federal Communications Commission auctions as a one-time way to help cut the deficit. ""We had a great success with the early auctions that raised over $23 billion. But it became like candy. And the budgeteers just couldn't put it down,"" Representative Mike Oxley, an Ohio Republican who first introduced auction legislation in 1993, said in an interview.
""At the very least, we ought to have some hearings and try to educate members (of Congress), the public, and particularly the budgeteers, that they're really playing with fire here."" Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican who chairs the commerce committee, wants the FCC to pay ""more attention to the market forces"" when it auctions spectrum for uses ranging from a new generation of cellular phones to satellite television.
""The last thing we want to do is have a distortion of the marketplace which would then cost people involved in the free enterprise system and the taxpayers,"" he said in an interview. McCain is preparing to offer a bill to keep spectrum from being dumped on the market.
But some analysts are wary of tinkering with the process. ""The idea that Congress can figure whether there's too much or too little spectrum -- or the right price -- I find arrogant and presumptuous,"" said Bill Bane, director at Mercer Management Consulting Inc.
The importance of airwave sales to the budget process was driven home by last week's disappointing auction. The sale -- for a piece of spectrum that will let users gain access to the Internet or create wireless local telephone networks -- raised just $13.6 million. That was a far cry from the $1.8 billion Congress was counting on to cut the deficit. FCC officials blamed the results on lawmakers' requirement to hold the auction by mid-April and to end it in time to help reduce red ink in the current 1997 fiscal year. They said companies did not have enough time to develop business plans.
""This was a good example of one that was ordered prematurely,"" Representative W. J. Billy Tauzin, chairman of the telecommunications subcommittee, said in an interview.
    ""It's a problem that has to do with our budgeteers ordering auctions that may be inappropriate, not with the auction process itself,"" added the Louisiana Republican.     Sen. Robert Kerrey, a Nebraska Democrat, offered a bill this week to set a minimum price for each airwave parcel sold. ""With a reserve pricing system, taxpayers will be guaranteed that national assets are not sold for a song,"" he said.
    Meanwhile, lawmakers are in no hurry to offer bills in response to the Justice Department probe of possible bid-rigging at auctions for advanced cellular-phone licenses. But the news put a further spotlight on the auctions.     ""This whole topic of spectrum auctions has become -- crazily enough -- kind of sexy,"" quipped House Commerce Committee aide Dennis Fitzgibbons.

3475,"Regulators are considering extending consumer safeguards for 900-number phone calls to other pay-per-call services that have zapped unwitting consumers with sky-high phone bills for overseas calls.
The Federal Trade Commission Wednesday said it will seek public comment on whether to apply the rules to information and entertainment services that callers dial though a prefix other than ""900."" The 900-number rules require clear cost disclosures and a means for settling billing disputes.
The newer services offer callers astrological and travel information, psychic advice and phone sex, among other things. Scams among ""audio information"" or ""audio entertainment"" services are a growing problem, according to one official.
Officials say providers of the services evade the 900 rules, adopted in 1992, by diverting calls to numbers in such countries as Guyana, the Dominican Republic, the tiny African country of Sao Tome, or the former Soviet Republic of Moldova.
In some cases the first three digits of the number -- such as 809, 758 or 664 -- resemble area codes in this country.
The difference: The overseas calls wind up in countries where the local phone company levies a charge of more than $2 a minute for completing the call. The rate far exceeds costs.
Government officials said this allowed the overseas phone company to provide a ""kickback"" to the pay-per-call service for each call sent abroad, payments that can drum up business.
""It has probably helped them to establish a modern telephone system,"" one FTC official said of the foreign phone companies.
Last year's overhaul of U.S. telecommunication law gave the FTC the authority to expand its 900-number rules to cover similar services not accessed by dialing 900.
Those rules give consumers three seconds to hang up after listening to a message disclosing the cost of the service.
A service also must spell out its costs. Calls that cost more than $2 must start with a message disclosing the price and identifying the name of the service.
The rules also ensure that consumers will not lose their phone service if they fail to pay for a 900 call. They also establish a mechanism for settling billing disputes.
The FTC recently brought a number of cases against alleged international pay-per-call schemes and has issued consumer alerts warning of the costs and risks of such services.
Last month it closed three steamy sites on the Internet after consumers complained of huge phone bills to Moldova.
The agency alleged that Audiotex Connection of Long Island, N.Y., and others distributed a sophisticted computer programme that -- unbeknownst to consumers -- caused a computer user's modem to disconnect from their local Internet access company and dial an overseas pay-per-call number to the former Soviet Republic. A lawyer for those involved denied wrongdoing.
Tim Elliott, president of the TeleServices Industry Association, said new rules were not necessarily needed for his industry. ""We police ourselves. It's pretty effective.""
He conceded, ""There are a lot of folks involved in the industry that are -- I don't want to say shady -- but who push the envelope.""

3485,"Regional Baby Bell phone companies appear to have triumphed over their long-distance rivals in a crucial regulatory battle that would leave some customers paying less and others more for their monthly bill.
The Federal Communications Commission has decided against ordering a precipitous cut in the $23 billion long-distance carriers such as AT&amp;T Corp. pay the Bells each year for access to the local phone network, said FCC and industry officials.
Bell executives at one point feared such cuts could cost their companies as much as $10 billion in revenues. Consumer groups and long-distance companies advocate immediate cuts in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion, saying that would mean a similar cut in long-distance rates.
""The Bells have dodged a bullet,"" said analyst Scott Cleland of Schwab Washington Research Group. ""They may get grazed. But they dodged a bullet that was aimed at them during the last six months.""
Instead of a big FCC-imposed cut, the agency plans to rely on competition to lower access charges over time, said FCC and industry officials. That could mean an FCC-imposed loss of Bell revenues of no more than $1 billion the first year.
Less clear was the impact on phone customers.
Those who make lots of long-distance calls would see a sizeable drop in their bills, said FCC officials.
But wireless phone subscribers could pay anywhere from 1 percent to 2 percent more a month through new fees. Customers with more than one phone line for a computer or the kids and who make few long-distance calls would see a monthly rate rise of around $1 or more.
""We're cutting away the frills,"" FCC Chairman Reed Hundt said in an interview.
""We're talking about a $1 subsidy per month that we're eliminating for somebody who's connecting a $2,500 computer to that line and purchasing $20 a month of unlimited access,"" said Hunt, a big advocate of the rules under consideration.
They are set to be voted on next week. Details may change.
FCC officials, meanwhile, say the plan would yield a cut in long-distance charges of more than $1 billion in the first year.
FCC officials oppose a steep cut for several reasons.
Citing rate hikes by AT&amp;T and MCI Communications Corp. late last year, they fear long-distance carriers may not fully pass on a major reduction to consumers and pocket some of the money. Long-distance executives vow to pass on the reductions.
FCC officials also fear a sharp cut would unleash a rise in local phone rates by carriers trying to recoup lost money.
""We're keeping basic residential dial tone at today's price,"" said Hundt.
Critics charge the plan would mean higher rates. AT&amp;T says long-distance customers will see a $1.5 billion jump at the outset in July. ""Regulators appear unlikely to squeeze the fat out of the Bells' prices, leaving consumers paying for inflated rates,"" said Gene Kimmelman of Consumers Union.
But Hundt says that over the next five years at least $10 billion ""will be transferred to consumers"" via access cuts.
The plan also would pay for $3 billion to connect schools, libraries and rural hospitals to the Internet and provide cheap phone service for the poor.
Access charges were created after the 1984 breakup of Ma Bell. Experts agree the $23 billion is more than the cost of providing local access. But they cannot agree on the amount.
FCC officials said 85 percent of the nation's 80 million residential phone customers would see a lower monthly bill.
Those who make lots of long-distance calls would benefit the most, because the agency plans to replace some of the existing per-minute access charges with a monthly flat rate.
The 15 percent of residents who do not make long-distance calls would see their bills stay the same.
But customers with more than one line and who make few long-distance calls are likely to see a rate rise.
That's because the ceiling, or cap, on the existing ""subscriber line charge"" is expected to rise to $5 a month from $3.50 for each additional residential line, and to roughly $7 a line for multi-line business customers from $6.
One possible way around the charge may be for customers to list their additional lines in a different name or use another local carrier, said industry officials.

3490,"Regulators Tuesday began auctioning a slice of spectrum that will let users gain access to the Internet over the airwaves or create wireless local phone networks that compete with traditional wired networks.
Twenty-four companies -- including units of BellSouth Corp., Pacific Telesis Group, Comcast Corp. and a Bell Atlantic Corp./Nynex Corp. joint venture -- are bidding for the rights to offer ""wireless communications service,"" or WCS.
The first day of bidding in the multi-day sale totalled $5.3 million. Analysts said recent financial problems among wireless carriers will put downward pressure on prices. It is the Federal Communication Commission's 14th airwave sale.
""I expect prices to go very low for this type of spectrum,"" said Elliott Hamilton, analyst at Strategis Group, a Washington-based consulting firm.
The FCC is auctioning 128 licenses. Of that total, 104 are 10 megahertz licenses that roughly cover state-wide areas. The remaining 24 permits are for 5 MHz of spectrum and cover larger regional areas.
The FCC is not dictating what services companies can offer over this portion of the spectrum.
Potential applications include broadband wireless access to the Internet, wireless local phone networks, and location services for pinpointing trucks and other vehicles.
The value of wireless spectrum has fallen after last year's $10.2 billion auction of licenses for a new generation of cellular phones known as ""personal communications services,"" or PCS.
Edward Warner, Washington bureau chief of Wireless Week magazine, said FCC officials ""should be ecstatic"" if the agency can net $2 billion from the lastest auction.
Several top bidders at the PCS sale are under financial strain after bidding high prices. Wall Street has been reluctant to invest in the ventures.
Also, FCC officials doubt wireless service providers can offer anytime soon the kind of mobile phone service available through PCS.
FCC officials cite restrictions on the use of the wireless service airwaves that are meant to prevent interference among users of an upcoming digital radio service that will be broadcast coast-to-coast via satellite. The wireless service and digital radio airwaves are adjacent to one another.
The FCC has raised some $23 billion through its airwave sales. But the financial problems among last year's PCS winners has raised doubts over whether the government will ever collect all the money it is owed.

3491,"Regulators will host an auction Tuesday that supporters promise will usher in a new breed of nationwide radio service but critics charge may cost U.S. taxpayers millions of dollars in lost revenue.
Up for grabs are two licenses to provide radio programming that will be beamed coast-to-coast via satellite. Digital radio will offer listeners CD-quality sound and specialized programming that can be tuned in anywhere in the nation.
""Americans will be able to travel anywhere in the country, including remote rural areas where radio reception is poor, and enjoy the same high-quality audio and wide selection of programs the entire trip,"" said William Caldwell, president of Seattle-based Digital Satellite Broadcasting Corp., one of the bidders at the Federal Communications Commission sale.
The FCC resolved a long-standing dispute among its four commissioners in early March by limiting the auction to the four companies that had applied by the end of 1992 to offer digital radio.
Two of the commissioners -- Chairman Reed Hundt and Susan Ness -- favored opening the sale to any company wanting to bid. But in the end they agreed reluctantly to limit the auction so the launch of digital radio would not be delayed further.
""The decision to keep the auction door closed may needlessly cost the public millions of dollars,"" Hundt said when the agency announced its decision.
Hundt said that if other companies value the digital radio airwaves but are ""arbitrarily excluded from the auction, it is safe to predict that the auction winners will simply sell their licenses to those companies.""
Aside from DBSC, the other three bidders are: CD Radio Inc. of Washington, D.C.; American Mobile Radio Corp., a unit of American Mobile Satellite Corp. of Reston, Va.; and Primosphere LP of New York.
Commissioner Rachelle Chong contended that opening the bidding would have been unfair to the four.
""These applicants have been ready and willing to move forward for some time. The have expended considerable rsources in developing this technology,"" she said, adding that the first application was filed seven years ago.
Digital radio is unlikely to be on the air for at least three years -- if not longer -- owing to the time it takes to get satellites built and deployed into orbit.
The service will probably be subscription-based, with an expected cost of about $10 a month. Listeners will have to buy a special radio receiver that will cost about $200, on top of the price of a regular radio.
The credit-card sized satellite antenna could be installed in cars, trucks and homes.
If it wins a license, DBSC plans to deliver regional programming throughout the country. It would offer, among other things, children's programming, foreign-language, classical music, opera, all-news, all-sport and educational programs to targeted demographic groups.
The programming would be offered as an advertising-supported service and as a commercial-free subscription service.

3504,"Russia's LUKoil, one of the world's biggest oil companies, will increasingly take its upstream business out of Siberia and into the Caspian and Gulf, in a move reflecting the tough economics of production at home.
LUKoil's strategy underscores the problems of producing oil in Russia, where expensive, hard-to-recover reserves, limp domestic demand and a struggling economy make exports and foreign projects the only ways to earn substantial profits.
""I can tell you we're not really interested in raising our oil output in Russia, and for three reasons -- pipeline capacity limits, small export terminals and low domestic demand,"" LUKoil spokesman Pyotr Neyev said in a brief telephone interview.
LUKoil heads into its shareholders' meeting on Thursday ready to put what Neyev said were net cash profits according to Russian standards of 3.87 trillion roubles ($673 million) to work on projects in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Iraq.
A second spokesman, Alexander Vasilenko, said LUKoil -- which says it has the most crude oil reserves of any traded oil company in the world -- aimed to produce at least one quarter of its oil outside Russia at the beginning of the next millenium.
""LUKoil does admit they're not investing much in their West Siberia operations,"" said Renaissance brokerage energy analyst Alexei Kokin. ""They have too many undiversified costs there, and they're relocating fronts.""
Among LUKoil's major non-Russia projects are a 52.5 percent stake in a $4 billion, 23-year production-sharing project in Iraq's Western Qurnah; a 12.5 percent stake in an $8 billion international Azeri Caspian project that is the largest foreign investment deal in the former Soviet Union; and significant stakes in two other Azeri projects.
It is set to receive a five percent stake in Chevron Corp's and Mobil Corp's Tengiz project in Kazakhstan, and has a $5.2 billion, 18-year joint venture agreement with Atlantic Richfield (ARCO), which owns eight percent of Russia's largest vertically-integrated oil firm.
It is also eyeing Algeria, and has a deal with Italy's Agip Spa to look at North African projects.
""I think the strategy is a correct one -- but it's not an easy one to copy,"" said a Western energy consultant, adding that LUKoil President Vagit Alekperov, half-Azeri and born in Baku, had connections to Caspian oil that other oil bosses did not.
Russian oil producers make no money on domestic production not exported and by some estimates earn 80-90 percent of their profits from sales abroad and the remainder from regional sales of refined oil products.
Output and transport costs for Western Siberia, where three-quarters of LUKoil's 10.7 billion barrels in proven reserves are located, are about $6 per barrel, Kokin said, compared to estimates of $2 per barrel in the Caspian.
""Generally, the domestic Russian oil business is loss-making,"" said the Western analyst. ""You get some earnings in regional distribution (of refined products like gasoline). But selling crude to Russian refineries or on the Russian spot market is loss-making.""
Despite an aggressive expansion programme, LUKoil, which accounted for nearly 20 percent of Russian oil production last year with output of 1.16 million barrels per day, sees home production rising by 2.4 percent this year.
Most Russian oil companies face similar problems, and are struggling to turn the tide against output declines while calculating the value of increased output against export pipelines already filled to the limit.
But LUKoil, a favourite among foreign portfolio investors, in part due to its success in consolidating control over its production units, refiners and distributers, is the exception, not the rule, among Russia's newly-privatised oil companies.
""LUKoil's move abroad is correct,"" said the Western analyst. ""But its Russian competitors will not be able to do the same.""

3505,"Russia's plans to cut electricity tariffs for good payers could jolt its giant aluminium industry, the world's largest exporter of the non-ferrous metal, into bigger profits, officials and analysts said on Monday.
But not all plants, they said, would benefit equally.
""Well, this is certainly a pretty good development,"" said Galina Stelmakova, deputy director for development and investments at Kontsern Alyuminiy, the Russian producers' group. ""It will streamline the economic situations at smelters.
Fuel and Energy Minister Boris Nemtsov, in charge of revamping natural monopolies in the energy and transport sectors, said earlier that electricity tariffs for domestic industry would drop by up to 30 percent from July.
Nemtsov said only users which paid on time for supplies would be eligible for the lower tariffs -- a condition many, but not all, Russian smelters meet.
Industry officials said that with electricity accounting for about 25 percent of the cost of producing a tonne of primary aluminium in Russia, lower power tariffs could help profits.
Yuri Shlaifshtein, a board member at Bratsk, the world's largest primary aluminium smelter, said leaner tariffs could help the Siberian plant's longterm plans to attract foreign investment for modernisation.
""I can only welcome this decision,"" he said by telephone, adding Bratsk always paid on time, in cash, for its electricity supplies. ""This won't affect our general production levels but it will make them more stable over the longterm.""
Russia, home to the world's largest smelters, exported 2.44 million tonnes of primary aluminium last year, the most of any producing country. Its total output was 2.87 million tonnes.
The reduction in power costs are not likely to be felt evenly, since different regions have different rates. The so-called European part of Russia, where only about 15 percent of Russia's aluminium is produced, pays the highest tariffs.
Irkutsk, another large East Siberian smelter, pays about 10 percent of its per-tonne production cost of $1,200 for electricity. In sharp contrast, the European smelters pay up to $600 for electricity for each tonne.
Boris Arlyuk of St Petersburg, Russia-based Alumconsult said the rate cuts would help the Kandalaksha, Nadvoisky and Volgograd smelters in the European part of Russia most of all, since those plants had the highest energy costs.
But they were also the least solvent, paying for electricity with metal or promissory notes, and might not be able to produce cash up front as Nemtsov wanted, he said.
Russian smelters are struggling to secure longterm electricity supply contracts to increase profits and plan for the future.
Nemstov's rate cuts are part of a wider drive by Moscow to spark life into industrial output in general, which has plummeted in the years since the breakup of the Soviet Union.
Ironically, electricity rate cuts could benefit the Siberian smelters the least, since some of them may have already secured longterm supply contracts with regional hydroelectrical plants.
""Now if we can just get the government to agree to a lower tariff for three years,"" Shlaifshtein added. ""And then get it to do the same thing for railway tariffs.""
Nemtsov, a young reformer who is also a first deputy prime minister, has also promised to cut rail tariffs -- a move the smelters would welcome.
Industry officials have said the cost of transporting Russian metal to world markets is more than twice the Western industry average of around 24 percent.
Kontsern Alyuminiy said in March that average Russian smelter profit margins had fallen to one percent in 1996 from 16 percent two years before.

3512,"Russian natural gas giant Gazprom announced restructuring and cost-cutting plans on Tuesday, but the world's biggest gas producer downplayed discord with the government over its fate and said it would stay intact.
Gazprom board chairman Rem Vyakhirev said the company -- one of Russia's most powerful entities but increasingly under government scrutiny -- had mostly resolved a row with ministries and property officials over restructuring.
He told a news conference the firm would shed 100,000 jobs this year -- a massive 26 percent of the workforce.
But Vyakhirev said Gazprom would remain a monopoly and would not be split up.
""All of the internal blocs will remain within the Gazprom organisation,"" he said, referring to internal restructuring which would create up to half a dozen units within the monopoly for output, marketing, transport, finance and other issues.
Gazprom is one of Russia's most politically influential and well-connected companies, but it has come under attack by the International Monetary Fund and some government officials over its opaque financial books and strict control over access to its pipelines.
But Vyakhirev sought to paint a picture of accord between Gazprom and the government, whose prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, once headed Gazprom but who has been conspicuously absent from recent public debate over the company's fate.
He said that he, First Deputy Prime Ministers Anatoly Chubais and Boris Nemtsov and Chernomrydin were all carrying out state duties in examining Gazprom activities.
""I think all four of us will reach agreement. I have a creed -- Russia and Gazprom are family. There will be no quarrels.""
Vyakhirev, displaying none of the fear other executives show at the prospect of shedding jobs, said the leaner workforce would save Gazprom three trillion roubles ($520 million) a year.
Russia accounts for 34 percent of world gas reserves and 27 percent of output; Gazprom produces nearly all of Russia's gas.
Analysts say that the company, which was once an entire ministry, is immensely rich from exports -- heating about one third of Europe -- but that it faces serious problems in collecting debts in the former Soviet Union for unpaid supplies.
Even the profit figures are open to doubt.
""When we worked with our auditors (Price Waterhouse), we saw our profits weren't accurately reflected, that our expenditures didn't always have something to do with output,"" Vyakhirev said.
""There are many unnecessary expenditures. We're cleaning out all our basic production spheres -- that means getting rid of anything that we don't need.""
But he said Gazprom was rich enough to pay seven trillion roubles ($1.2 billion) to state coffers by June 10 to help President Boris Yeltsin meet a promise to pay pension arrears.
Nemtsov has put Gazprom's debts to the federal budget at a whopping 14.8 trillion roubles ($2.6 billion), while Gazprom says it is owed a dizzying 64 trillion roubles ($11.2 billion).
The state has a 40 percent stake in Gazprom, seven eighths of it personally managed in trust by Vyakhirev. Last week, after a row between Vyakhirev and ministers, Privatisation Minister Alfred Kokh said the government would review the arrangement.
Government officials said this week they had lost the document outlining the deal. Vyakhirev said they later found it and that the scheme would stay, but with some changes.
Nemtsov, a reformer entrusted with restructuring Russia's natural monopolies, including Gazprom, has long said the monopoly will not be broken up into separate output and transport companies. ""Only a nut would destroy Gazprom,"" Nemtsov was quoted by Interfax news agency as saying.
The company operates a strict separation between its domestically-traded shares and those covered by its ADSs in London.
Gazprom was trading at $0.665 on the Russian Trading System at 1230 GMT versus $0.620 on Monday. The ADSs, covering 10 underlying shares, were at $16.45 in London versus Monday's close of $16.30.

3517,"Pinning down the size of Russia's grain harvest is proving a problem for analysts and traders due to widely differing estimates from official and trade groups.
Various government and private-sector predictions put Russia's net grain output at anywhere from 70 to 80 million tonnes -- a range which could leave Moscow with one of its worst harvests ever or give it a more comfortable margin.
""The situation is still tense and serious,"" said independent agriculture specialist Andrei Sizov of SovEcon Ltd consultancy on Friday, citing miniscule stocks from last year's harvest.  
But Arkady Zlochevsky, president of the OGO grain and food trading company, one of Russia's largest, saw net grain output at 80 million tonnes. ""We are not optimists, we are realists -- we know how much peasants and regional administrations water down the real figures,"" he said.
The various numbers see output recovering anywhere from 11 to 21 percent from last year's drought-hit 63.4 million tonnes.
Agriculture Minister Viktor Khlystun said in June, his last public forecast, that he saw output at 70 million tonnes, while Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Zaveryukha, who is in charge of the harvest, put the figure this week at 75-77 million tonnes.  
In a separate estimate, the state statistics committee sees output at 71-72 million tonnes.
Sizov said he saw net output at 70 million tonnes.
A Russian source at a Western industry organisation put it at 74-75 million tonnes, based on recent talks with other trade sources in Moscow and abroad. ""These are the figures we've got right now,"" the source said. ""I think they're realistic.""
The state meteorological service, which bases its forecasts on weather conditions only, and not on factors like tractor availability, sees output in the 71-75 million tonne range.  
The International Grains Council sees the crucial Russian wheat harvest alone rising to 34 million tonnes, while Zlochevksy sees 37 million tonnes.
The lower-range net output numbers still mean the 1996 harvest could be one of the worst three since 1965.
The Russian government will not issue a final figure until at least the first two weeks of October, when the harvest officially ends -- leaving trade sources now to watch the all-important Siberian harvest, key to regional supplies.  
""The harvest in the European part of Russia is nearly over and pretty much a known entity -- the focus right now is Western and Eastern Siberia,"" Sizov said.
In Siberia, farmers are battling weeks of rains that have moved the harvest closer to the date of the first snow, which can come as early as the end of the month.
""I think they could lose three or four million tonnes there,"" due to the weather, one trade source said. --Moscow Newsroom, +7095 941 8520

3518,"The former Soviet Union will probably see grain output increase this year after last year's drought-hit disaster, industry officials said on Friday.
But unpredictable weather in Russia, Kazakhstan and Ukraine, the region's biggest grain producers, could still hit volume and quality levels.
""Ukraine was very bad last year, Russia was quite low and Kazakhstan was below average,"" said Andrei Sizov of SovEcon Ltd, a private agricultural consultancy in Moscow, referring to 1996 output levels that were among the worst in three decades.
""This year, weather conditions have so far been better for all three. But 'better' is in comparison to what was last year's really bad situation.""
Kazakhstan and Ukraine export much of their surplus grain to Russia and other former Soviet republics, as well as to Eastern and Central Europe. Kazakhstan accounted for up to three quarters of Russia's wheat and wheat flour imports last year.
Sowing in the three countries is nearly complete, and industry sources said the weather, not low agricultural inputs, was the main factor -- and the main unknown.
""I think we can definitely say output in all three countries will improve on last year, but it's all still unpredictable because the weather is unpredictable,"" said Vladimir Totsky, deputy director of Russia's Grain Union, a private grouping of traders and producers.
Russia may finally reverse a five-year trend of declining grain area, with around 30 million hectares sown, not including maize, on public-sector farms.
""This is more than enough for Russia to meet its needs,"" Sizov said, forecasting net wheat output of 35-38 million tonnes compared with last year's 35 million. ""Imports will fall and there may be material for export.""
Officials have forecast net grain output of at least 70 million tonnes after last year's 69.3 million, which was the second worst crop in three decades.
Average temperatures in the European part of Russia were five to six degrees Celsius lower than normal at the end of May, Viktor Trenin of the State Meteorological Service said, adding the cold had not seriously hurt crops.
But Siberia and the Urals had the most unusual weather in a century, he said, adding that very hot, dry temperatures in recent weeks made crops grow too fast and sucked moisture away.
An expected cold snap with possible frosts could further hurt plantings, he said, adding, ""We haven't seen fluctuations like this in 100 years. It's dangerous."" He said it was too early to predict weather patterns in the coming months.
An Agriculture Ministry official said Russian winter grains were in good condition, with winterkill losses the lowest in five years at five percent, compared with last year's eight to 11 percent.
In Ukraine, crops were planted two weeks late and experienced a cooler, wet spring. Totsky said yields were below 1996 levels.
Ukrainian officials have declined to forecast summer weather conditions, but Sizov said net grain output in the former breadbasket would rise to 31-33 million tonnes from last year's paltry 25.4 million. The government has forecast 35 million tonnes.
In Kazakhstan, the most secretive of the big former Soviet producers, officials have declined to forecast publicly how output might improve on last year's official, drought-hit 11.6 million tonnes. Almaty's Agro-Industrial Exchange sees output at a net 14 million tonnes.
""They had some problems with their sowing campaign,"" said Totsky, referring to official figures showing the area sown to grain down to 14.5 million hectares from 1996's 16.1 million.
The giant Central Asian state saw an early spring with heavy rains. Sizov said the weather was a big factor in northern Kazakhstan, where drought often mixes with downpours and snows during the autumn harvest.
""Every year, we have to wait and see what cards the weather deals us,"" said Totsky. ""This year will be better, but there's still an element of unpredictability.""

The strike, the second at the company this year, unnerved industry players, who said Norilsk could either increase exports to generate cash to pay overdue salaries or cut back output and exports because of labour unrest.
""It's a minefield,"" said a nickel trader at a major Western commodities house.
""If you deal with these people very carefully, things will be okay -- but only if,"" the source said, adding that instability in Russia's coal industry could spread to Russia's non-ferrous metals sector.
Interfax said Norilsk workers would refuse to load metals for export from September 16 unless an agreement was reached with management over 800 billion roubles ($148.7 million) in wage arrears.
""The problem is serious and possibly long-term,"" said Ilya Korotkov, product manager at Russian metals exporter European Materials Agency, which exports small amounts of Norilsk output.
""They will try to export more to pay off salaries,"" he said, adding that exports could rise 10-15 percent in the second quarter of 1996. ""They don't have many other choices.""
Russia is the world's largest miner of nickel ore and concentrate, and Norilsk, whose exports are key to balance in the market, is the world's second largest producer of refined nickel, a key ingredient in stainless steel.
The company also produces huge quantities of copper, cobalt, platinum and platinum group metals.
""They really have some severe problems with cash flows,"" said Olga Vinogradova, a metals analyst at United City Bank in Moscow, adding she had heard of some export delays, which traders had reported earlier this week. ""This strike is not going to have a positive impact on clients.""
Sources said Norilsk was moving from pre-financing to Western export credits to boost profitability.
Benchmark nickel contracts on the London Metals Exchange are at around $7,530 a tonne, down from September highs of $7,850.
Sources said Norilsk, which reported a net profit for 1995 of 138 billion roubles and debts of 6.8 trillion roubles, all under Russian accounting standards, was facing one of its first major financial tests since privatisation.
Norilsk director Alexander Khloponin has said he wants to turn the company around and Interfax quoted him as saying he saw several ways to raise cash to pay salaries, including asset sales, more effective exports and more efficient production.
Norilsk produced 180,100 tonnes of nickel in 1995, up nearly 11 percent from 1994, and it expects 1996 production to rise by three percent.
But Russian nickel output, most of it at Norilsk, fell seven percent in August on July levels, according to state figures.
Trade sources said Norilsk, built in 1935 on a swamp 200 km (130 miles) north of the Arctic Circle, was strugging with its status as a cash-sucking firm that must fly in food and soap for workers.
""Workers don't have much there, and the least they expect is their salary,"" said a Russian metals source. ""But turning that place around is easier said than done.""

3534,"Russia will be a big buyer of Iraqi oil once again as Baghdad gears up to export more crude to raise much-needed cash for food and medicine, Russian officials said on Thursday.
""We're aiming for as much this time as we had last time,"" said Yuri Agababov, deputy general director of Zarubezhneft, the Moscow-based firm coordinating Russian contracts for Iraqi oil under the United Nation's oil-for-food deal.
The United Nations renewed a $2 billion, 180-day programme on Wednesday under which Iraq will export oil to raise cash for humanitarian needs and to pay reparations to Gulf War victims after Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
Russian companies bought nearly 28.54 billion barrels of Iraqi oil under the first 180-day programme, or a whopping 23.4 percent of the 121.6 million or so barrels Baghdad was permitted to export under that first deal.
""We're hoping to do this much again,"" Agababov said in a brief telephone interview. ""But it will all depend on how the commercial terms of our talks proceed. Let's not jinx it by talking about it before it happens.""
The U.N. resolution renews the programme from June 8, right after the first deal expires, and Agababov said he would head a delegation of Russian companies to Baghdad next week to begin negotiating contracts with Iraqi state oil firm SOMO.
He said talks had not yet taken place and declined to say whether contracts had been pre-negotiated in principle.
""Those firms which participated will do so again, and there may be some new players,"" Agababov said, adding that Russian companies lifted their last loading of crude on May 22-25.
Russia has an inside track to Iraq, its Soviet-era trading partner and geopolitical ally, and is keen to see Baghdad flush with cash to repay the $7 billion it owes Moscow.
Russia's -- and one of the world's -- largest oil companies, LUKoil, has a 52.5 percent stake in a $4 billion, 23-year production-sharing project in Iraq's Western Qurnah oil field.
Other Russian firms, including Mashinoimport, have supplied Baghdad with oil equipment, and organisations close to the Foreign Trade Ministry sent wheat, sugar, vegetable oils and other foodstuffs.
But Agababov said commerce, not politics, was at work in the oil-for-food deal. ""We'll participate on the same level and terms as others,"" he said. ""It all comes down to the terms of the contracts.""
He declined to say how the terms had been attractive to the eight Russian oil-producing and trading companies which had contracts under the first deal.
Benchmark Brent Blend's nearby contract, a benchmark for valueing Iraq's exports and thus their quantity, was around $18.74 a barrel in early London futures trade.
That was more than $5.00 below the December 10, 1996 nearby-contract level when Iraq first returned to world oil markets under the first U.N. programme.
But Russian traders, who are finding it tougher to win access to tight domestic export pipelines, are keen to get their hands on any oil they can.
Vladimir Bjedougov, deputy head of major trader Alfa-Eko's international section, which had a big contract under the first programme, said lifters had taken a hit from what he called the failure of the U.N.-Iraqi price formula to reflect the market.
""Prices fluctuated fairly sharply for a while and the formula didn't reflect the difference -- but I wouldn't say this experience would have any effect on our next talks,"" he said.
""On the contrary, it will make things easier. The first contract went well, even though in any deal, there are always technical problems -- but none of them were critical.""

3536,"Russian economic crime officials said on Thursday they were investigating the head of Russia's second largest aluminium smelter.
Company and ministry officials said Yuri Kolpakov, general director of Krasnoyarsk, the second biggest aluminium smelter in the world, was under investigation over the alleged failure to repatriate $20 million from contracts for raw materials supplies.
Olga Semenyaka, a member of an Interior Ministry investigative committee dedicated to the crackdown on crime in industry, told Reuters by telephone from the south Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk that she had personally opened the investigation on Monday.
""I think I have told you enough,"" Semenyaka said. She declined to give further details.
Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov is locked in a battle against what he has described as the ""crime-ridden"" world of Russia's aluminium industry, which last year was the world's biggest exporter of primary metal.
Gennady Druzhinin, Krasnoyarsk's board chairman, confirmed by telephone from Krasnoyarsk that a probe had been launched against Kolpakov, but also gave no details.
Asked if output or exports would be affected, he said, ""No.""
Krasnoyarsk produced 770,000 tonnes of aluminium last year, 27 percent of Russia's 2.87 million tonne output.
Andrei Grigoryev, head of the smelter's information section, said he did not know of the charges and said Kolpakov was out of town. Reuters could not contact him.
Interior Ministry officials in Moscow could not be reached for immediate comment.
Kulikov has never said what kind of crimes he believes take place in the domestic metal industry, but Russian aluminium officials have in the past been the target of death threats and contract killings.
Industry sources said the investigation of Kolpakov concerned a tolling deal -- under which a trading company supplies a smelter with raw materials for processing and then exports the finished metal -- with an offshore concern identified by the sources as Leo Trust Company.
Krasnoyarsk, also known as KrAZ, does much of its tolling business with Glencore AG of Switzerland, which has a stake in the smelter and a joint venture called Krazpa Metals NV. There is no suggestion Glencore is linked in any way to the investigation.
""If it weren't for Glencore, we wouldn't be working right now,"" said a Krasnoyarsk source. --Moscow Newsroom, +7095 941 8520

3550,"Chinese police have moved North Korean diplomats away from the area around the South Korean mission in Beijing where a top-level Pyongyang official has taken refuge, witnesses said on Friday.
However, there was no sign of movement in a diplomatic impasse over the fate of Hwang Jang-yop, 73, a pillar of North Korea's Stalinist establishment, and his assistant who have sought asylum in the South.
China, finding itself in a diplomatic quandary involving its old communist comrade and a new commercial friend, has avoided direct comment and chosen instead to appeal for calm.
In Singapore, South Korean Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha and Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen met to discuss a South Korean appeal for safe passage from Beijing to Seoul for the defector, a senior aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il.
Qian said after the talks that Beijing needed more time.
""This incident happened all of a sudden, so we need more time to investigate,"" he told reporters.
In the sedate, tree-lined diplomatic district of Beijing, dozens of Chinese police cordoned Seoul's consular section off for a second day. Hwang, the most senior official to defect from North Korea, arrived on Wednesday to seek asylum.
""They are harassing us and we are a little nervous about that,"" said South Korean embassy spokesman Chang Moon Ik, adding that Seoul had asked Beijing to maintain tight security around the compound.
Chinese police moved away several North Koreans watching the compound from cars parked in side streets overnight, witnesses said.
""I still don't believe it,"" said one North Korean who drove up to the cordon on Friday. ""Judging from this situation and his position it is not possible for him to defect.
""If China allows him to go to South Korea then we will be disappointed,"" said the North Korean, who declined to identify himself. ""It will be regrettable.""
Pyongyang has charged that Hwang, 73, one of the chief architects of North Korean communism, must have been kidnapped, and has called on Beijing to sort out the mess.
Seoul has dismissed Pyongyang's charges that Hwang, one of 11 secretaries on the powerful secretariat of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party, was kidnapped, saying he arrived at the compound in a taxi on Wednesday.
China's Foreign Ministry said it had nothing to say on Friday on the diplomatic tussle in its backyard.
It was not clear whether Kim Ha-jung, a special adviser to South Korean Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha, would meet Chinese officials on Friday.
Kim failed to hold talks with Chinese officials when he arrived from Seoul on Thursday as Beijing, apparently angered by Seoul's decision to export its latest row with Pyongyang into China, avoided a meeting, South Korean sources said.
However, he met the defector inside the compound.
Officials at the North Korean embassy refused to comment or confirm reports from Seoul that Pyongyang had sent a delegation led by an official at the level of vice-minister and including officials from the ruling Workers Party and the Foreign Ministry to discuss Hwang's defection.
South and North Korea were separated at the end of World War Two and fought a war from 1950 to 1953. China fought on North Korea's side in the conflict.

3553,"Chinese police have arrested the suspected ringleader of a riot in the mainly Moslem northwestern region of Xinjiang last week that left at least 10 people dead and 144 injured, local officials said on Wednesday.
Abudu Heilili, 29, of the Uighur ethnic minority, was in police custody and under interrogation following the riot last Wednesday and Thursday in Yining near China's border with Kazakhstan, said a local Communist Party committee official.
The suspect was unemployed, and was a ringleader of a less violent anti-Chinese demonstration in Yining in August 1995, the official told Reuters by telephone.
Heilili had been released after that demonstration following ""ideological education"" -- a codeword for political indoctrination, he said.
Police rounded up 200 to 300 people after last week's riot, in which at least 10 people were killed and 144 injured. Many suspects had been released after questioning, officials said.
The death toll could rise, with up to seven people listed as missing, the party official said. About 90 people were treated for head wounds, and more than 10 were still in hospital.
Of the injured, 132 were civilians while the remaining 12 were members of the paramilitary People's Armed Police, a spokesman for the Xinjiang regional government said by telephone from Urumqi, Xinjiang's capital.
Authorities had issued circulars calling on local officials to deal a blow to separatism in the frontier region and warning of severe punishment for last week's rioters.
""We are resolved to deal a blow to the handful of ethnic separatist elements,"" said Zhang Youlian, deputy director of foreign affairs office for the Yili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, that administers Yining.
About 1,000 people, mostly Uighur farmers or unemployed young men, rioted in Yining last week in one of the largest and most violent demonstrations for independence in the mainly Moslem region of Xinjiang since the 1949 communist takeover.
Turkic-speaking Uighurs are in the majority in Xinjiang, where ethnic Han Chinese make up 38 percent of the population.
""We don't want the Communist Party,"" the demonstrators had chanted, witnesses said.
Uighur demonstrators had attacked Han Chinese with bricks, clubs and knives, and rampaged through the town, smashing and setting fire to about 20 vehicles and looting shops.
The People's Armed Police only succeeded in dispersing the rioters a day later, firing teargas to break up the crowd.
Authorities had sealed off Yining, an after-dark curfew was in force in some districts and armed police still patrolled the streets. The airport would reopen on Friday, officials said.
A Chinese source said the riot erupted after a Uighur criminal suspect resisted arrest by police.
Yusupbek Mukhlisi, leader of the United National Revolutionary Front of East Turkestan based in Kazakhstan, said the riot was sparked by the execution of 30 Uighurs in China last week. Chinese officials dismissed the report.
Yining is 50 km (30 miles) from the border with Kazakhstan, where many exiled Uighur separatists live.
Xinjiang authorities last year stepped up a crackdown on separatists and underground religious activity after clashes, bombings and assassination attempts on officials and Moslem leaders regarded as pro-Beijing.
Last May, Beijing ordered tighter controls along Xinjiang's lengthy border to block the smuggling of weapons and subversive materials from nearby central Asian states.

3555,"China on Friday angrily denied that its worsening pollution was a threat to the world environment and accused developed countries of concocting the fallacy to monopolise global resources.
""It is rumour and sensationalism,"" the official China Daily said of the ""China environmental threat"" theory. ""It is a cry that the sky is falling when a leaf flutters from a tree.""
China had done more to clean up its environment than developed countries in their initial stages of industrialisation, it said.
Officials announced plans in September to spend up to 320 billion yuan ($38.6 billion) over the next five years to curb pollution and limit damage to the environment.
By last November, the Legal Daily said China had shut down almost 57,000 small polluting factories in a bid to limit environmental damage. Most of the closed enterprises produced paper, fertilisers, electroplates, or extracted sulphur.
It said more than 20,000 environment officials fanned out across China to inspect factories and close down polluting units after the State Council, or cabinet, issued an edict in August to step up environmental protection.
""It is the developed countries that should shoulder the major responsibility of the current condition of world environmental pollution,"" the newspaper said.
""China, at its initial stage of industrialisation, has drawn a lesson from the industrialised countries and has never been willing to sacrifice its environment to develop its economy.""
Even though China's annual per capita income stood at only $400, it was committed to protecting the environment whereas developed countries only began fighting pollution when their per capita incomes hit $3,000, it said.
Factory chimneys across China spew out columns of black smoke, their pipes eject millions of tonnes of untreated waste into rivers and lakes, and a blanket of smog hides the sun above many cities as almost two decades of rapid economic growth have pushed China toward a sink-or-swim market economy.
Some of the world's highest levels of air pollution have been recorded by Chinese cities and acid rain is common.
China, a rising superpower, sees international criticism of issues ranging from its military build-up to human rights abuses as a conspiracy to contain its development.
The China Daily ran a cartoon of a man pointing a finger at a couple who were cleaning their yard and shouting: ""Hey, you dirty the environment!"" while smoke billowed from a chimney in his own filthy backyard.
The newspaper took a swipe at developed countries for polluting the environment, saying they were responsible for emitting 75 percent of the carbon monoxide in the atmosphere.
""The motive for concocting the amazing 'China environmental threat' fallacy is not hard to see through...It is a trick employed by some developed countries to direct people's attention away from reality and to evade their own responsibilities.
""There are those who are unwilling to see China progress and who are trying to contain its development by pointing their fingers at the world's environmental problems,"" it said.
""They hope to maintain the pattern of the past, in which already developed countries continue to enjoy the majority of the world's resources.""

3556,"China has jailed two Mongolians for up to 15 years on charges of separatism and espionage, the London-based human rights group Amnesty International said on Thursday.
Hada, 41, former manager of the Mongolian Academic Bookshop, and Tegexi, 30, who worked in the Inner Mongolian Bureau of Foreign Affairs, were sentenced last December to 15 and 10 years in prison respectively, Amnesty said.
Chinese courts rejected their appeals last month and upheld their original sentences, it said. The pair had been held for a year in solitary confinement without charges or a trial.
""No evidence has been made public to show that Hada and Tegexi were involved in any activity which may be regarded as criminal under international standards,"" Amnesty said.
It called for their immediate and unconditional release.
The Amnesty report could not be independently confirmed. Officials in China could not be reached for comment on the eve of Lunar New Year holidays.
Amnesty said eight others were detained in December for alleged involvement in ""nationalist separatist"" activities, but were subsequently released.
Inner Mongolia, a Chinese province, is populated mainly by ethnic Mongolians but there has been little sign of anti-Chinese unrest since the early years after the 1949 communist takeover and the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution when dissent was crushed.
However, in late 1995, authorities in Inner Mongolia arrested 12 people who had demanded more democracy and an autonomous region, according to human rights groups.
Hada and Tegexi were being detained in poor conditions and their health was suffering, Amnesty said. They were living in a cell in Inner Mongolia's Number One Prison with over 30 other people, the report added.
Hada has a recurrence of tuberculosis and his neck was swollen, the group said. It was not known if he had received any medical treatment in prison.
Beijing-based Western analysts say China has tightened its grip on dissent and separatist sentiment ahead of the British colony of Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule on July 1.
""The harsh sentences passed on Hada and Tegexi are indicative of the severe attitude taken during the past year by the Chinese authorities towards suspected nationalists in...Tibet and Xinjiang,"" Amnesty said.
Inner Mongolia has traditionally been less restive than Tibet and Xinjiang.
Tibet has been rocked in recent years by periodic unrest, which China blames on the Himalayan region's god-king, the Dalai Lama, who fled into exile in India after an abortive uprising against communist rule in 1959.
Xinjiang borders Afghanistan, Pakistan and three mostly Moslem Central Asian states. The region has been shaken in recent months by several clashes and political killings involving separatists who want to end communist rule in Xinjiang.
""This 'crackdown' has also affected those whose peaceful religious activities are deemed to threaten 'national unity' and 'social stability',"" Amnesty said.

3557,"North Korea said on Monday it would fire a top official marooned in South Koreas embassy in China if he sought asylum and Seoul went on alert for possible attack but said it wanted talks on the Cold War crisis.
Pyongyangs Foreign Ministry, commenting on the highest level defection yet from the Stalinist nation, saying that if leading ideologue Hwang Jang-yop had been kidnapped, then North Korea would take ""decisive countermeasures"".
""Our stand is simple and clear. If he was kidnapped, we cannot tolerate it and we will take decisive countermeasures,"" the KCNA news agency, monitored in Tokyo, quoted the Foreign Ministry as saying.
""If he sought asylum, it means that he is a renegade and he is dismissed,"" it said, adding that it had asked Beijing to investigate what it called the disappearance of Hwang, who took refuge in Seouls mission in Beijing six days ago.
North Koreas ambassador was believed to have met officials at Chinas Foreign Ministry on Monday.
Hwangs defection has embarrassed his hermit homeland, delighted Seoul and mired Beijing in a quandary over how to usher him out of China without offending an old communist comrade or a new capitalist friend.
But Hwang turned 74 on Monday with no sign of progress to celebrate in his appeal for asylum in the South, and still stranded in Seouls heavily guarded consulate in Beijing.
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright voiced U.S. concern over events on the Korean peninsula, saying they underlined the need for dialogue between rival North and South.
South Korea prepared for possible attacks by Pyongyang as the Cold War crisis escalated, but said confrontation over the defector would not scuttle its efforts for detente.
Another prominent defector, Li Il-nam, a nephew of North Korean leader Kim Jong-ils ex-wife, remained in a coma after being shot and critically wounded at the weekend by suspected North Korean agents near Seoul.
Security around South Koreas ports, airports and other public places had been beefed up and 10,000 police and soldiers searched for the two suspected agents who shot Li.
Seoul Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha said problems stemming from Hwangs defection were just the start of headaches for Seoul because of a crisis in the North.
""I believe the North Korean regimes crisis will deepen as time passes because theres no likelihood of improvement in its economic hardship and food shortages, and signs of laxity in its social order,"" Yoo told a meeting of South Korean diplomats.
South Koreas security-related ministers on Sunday agreed that a desperate Pyongyang resort to guerrilla attacks after Hwang, a top adviser the Norths Kim Jong-il, sought asylum.
Dour warnings from North Korean officials in Beijing of the consequences of any attempt to move Hwang to the South gave a hint of Pyongyangs willingness to retaliate.
""If they make him go to Seoul, I think there will be war,"" said one North Korean official who declined to be identified.
South Korean diplomats and Chinese police guarding the mission brought in extra blankets and mattresses in a sign they expected a lengthy stand-off over Hwang.
However, dozens of North Korean officials disappeared on Monday afternoon from outside the building where they have kept a round-the-clock vigil since Hwang disappeared inside.
China, an unwilling third party in the feuding between the two hostile ends of the Korean peninsula, has appealed to both sides to act calmly to resolve the affair.
Analysts say the North has suffered huge loss of face over the defection of Hwang, who was ranked high in the hierarchy of his Stalinist homeland and was the architect of its governing ideology of Juche, or strict self-reliance.

3562,"Beijing has pledged to open its doors ajar to imports of U.S. textiles under a new deal, but Washington has no illusions it can close its yawning textile trade gap with China, diplomats said on Monday.
Chinese and U.S. negotiators signed a new textile agreement in Beijing on Sunday in an 11th-hour deal that ended the threat of a cross-Pacific trade war and ensured U.S. access to China's textile markets.
""It (the deal) provides us with an opportunity to increase our access to China's markets in high-priority areas,"" one diplomat said. He declined to elaborate.
""(But) we are under no illusions that we are going to balance textiles as a single sector of our trade,"" a second diplomat said on condition of anonymity.
China exported $6.5 billion worth of textiles to the United States in 1995 but imported only $64 million. Diplomats attributed the sluggish U.S. textile exports to Beijing's high tariff rates and non-tariff barriers.
""Textiles are never going to be balanced but it's important that there be a market access element there,"" the second diplomat said.
The agreement gave China a U.S. import quota slightly larger than the previous 1994 textile pact, and China pledged to reduce its tariffs on textile imports.
Both the Chinese and U.S. sides declined to say by how much U.S. textile exports to China would increase and vice versa, or by how much China's tariffs would be cut.
""There are significant gains for U.S. industries,"" a third diplomat said.
""It was, for the first time, a concessionary admission on (the) part of the Chinese that they too had to do something with regard to supplying market access for U.S. products where we were competitive,"" he said but did not go into details.
The overall U.S. trade deficit with China -- the United States' largest after its deficit with Japan -- was seen reaching $38 billion in 1996, up from $34 billion in 1995, according to U.S. figures.
The new textile agreement may be good news for U.S. textile manufacturers and exporters, but it could be bad news for China's lumbering state enterprises.
A flood of U.S. textile imports could intensify competition and further cripple many of China's state enterprises, almost half of which are in the red, analysts said.
""U.S. textile imports will intensify competition in the already saturated domestic textile market,"" a Chinese economist said.
""Life will be even more difficult for a group of loss-making textile enterprises,"" said the economist, who asked not to be identified. ""Some enterprises will be forced to bow out of the textile industry -- declare bankruptcy or merge.""
State-owned textile factories in Shanghai, China's largest industrial city, registered losses of 350 million yuan ($42.2 million) in the first seven months of 1996, the China Business Times said on Monday.
The accord ended the threat of a Sino-U.S. trade war, which had loomed after Washington slapped $19 million in penalties on Chinese imports last September, accusing Beijing of shipping textiles through third countries to evade U.S. restrictions on Chinese imports.
China had threatened to retaliate by temporarily banning imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods and alcoholic drinks but delayed the action to allow time for further talks.
Beijing announced after Sunday's deal that it was calling off its retaliatory measures, but Washington's penalties remained in force.

3565,"Chinese Communist Party boss Jiang Zemin has wooed Taiwan's ruling and opposition parties to come up with constructive suggestions on reunification of the two sides, split by civil war almost five decades ago.
""We welcome Taiwan's various political parties...to exchange views with us on relations between the two sides and on constructive suggestions about peaceful reunification,"" Jiang told a government advisory body on New Year's Day.
Chinese newspapers carried the full text of Jiang's speech on Thursday.
Earlier this week, Jiang made a similar overture, but he made no mention of the island's political parties, instead referring to Taiwanese from all walks of life.
Taiwan's ruling Nationalist Party, which fled into exile on the island after losing the Chinese civil war in 1949, says it is committed to reunification but is in no hurry to do so. Taiwan insists on reunification under freedom and democracy and a free market economy.
The island's main opposition Democratic Progressive Party has called for ""self-determination"", or letting Taiwan's residents decide for themselves whether to reunify or declare independence.
China, which regards Taiwan as a rebel province, has threatened to invade if the island declares independence.
""Taiwan is our country's sacred territory,"" Jiang said.
""We hope the Taiwanese authorities...will stop all activities splitting the motherland and take realistic action to improve relations between the two sides,"" he said.
Tensions between Beijing and Taipei began to ease in the late 1980s, but relations plunged after Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui made a trip to the United States in a bid to break the island out of diplomatic isolation imposed by China.
Ties deteriorated further last March when China conducted war games and missile tests close to Taiwan in the run-up to the island's historic presidential elections. China frowns on Western-style democracy.
Analysts said Jiang was eager for reunification to secure his place in modern Chinese history alongside Mao Zedong, who established the People's Republic, and Deng Xiaoping, who cemented the return of the British colony of Hong Kong to Chinese rule in mid-1997.
Jiang, the anointed successor of Deng, China's 92-year-old paramount leader, is seen by some Western analysts as merely a transitional figure and he has struggled to shake off that image.
Jiang's call on Taiwan to come up with suggestions on ways to reunify could go unanswered again, one Chinese analyst said.
China has been bitter since Taiwan ignored Jiang's 1995 ""eight point"" proposal on reunification, in which he called for leaders of the two sides to exchange visits.
Jiang was seen by some in the military and the Communist Party as weak after his earlier call for reunification fell on deaf ears, analysts said.
His latest overture to Taiwan could backfire and be used by his political opponents to attack him, another analyst said.

The survey, conducted by the official China Youth Daily last December, showed that 99.4 percent of 15,000 people interviewed nationwide thought young Chinese ""should remember"" Japan's 1931-45 occupation of China.
More than 97 percent of the respondents were aged below 40, too young to have been victims of Japan's war atrocities. By Beijing's count, 35 million Chinese were killed or wounded by invading Japanese troops.
Asked what first came to their minds when Japan was mentioned, 81.3 percent of respondents said the Rape of Nanjing.
Japanese troops marched into Nanjing, China's pre-communist capital and known then as Nanking, in 1937 and engaged in an orgy of rape and massacre. Up to 250,000 Chinese were believed to have been killed.
More than 97 percent of respondents said they could not tolerate repeated attempts by Japanese officials to whitewash their wartime atrocities, including the Rape of Nanjing.
The China Youth Daily survey showed that 94.9 percent of the respondents were opposed to Japan becoming a United Nations Security Council member.
It also showed that 85.1 percent of respondents believed Japan wanted to become a military superpower and 70.7 percent saw Japan as a new threat to peace in Asia.
China itself ruffled feathers in the region last March when it intimidated rival Taiwan by conducting missile tests and war games close to the island in the run-up to Taiwan's historic presidential elections.
The sheer size of the People's Liberation Army -- the world's biggest at three million -- has caused uneasiness among China's neighbours.
China has been mired in a dispute with Japan over a group of islands in the East China Sea and another dispute with Asian neighbours over the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea.
The survey showed that 53.8 percent of respondents thought that Japanese despised Chinese, while 50.8 percent said Japanese discriminated against Chinese.
Many Chinese themselves harbour deep suspicions and are hostile toward foreigners.
More than 56 percent of the respondents said the Japanese were ""cruel"", 45.2 percent said ""arrogant"" and 45.3 percent described them as ""war freaks"" by nature.
But 52.7 percent of the respondents said they owned Japanese-made electrical appliances.
Many respondents were suspicious of Japanese motives for investing in China. More than half said Japanese investment aimed to control China, while 45.3 percent said Japan dumped outdated equipment in China.

With Beijing loosening its grip slightly in recent years, more Uighurs and Tibetans have dared to speak their minds, and many clamour for independence in defiance of Beijing's attempts to dilute their culture.
An anti-Chinese riot in the restive northwestern region of Xinjiang -- a region that Moslem separatists call East Turkestan -- this month left nine people dead and 198 wounded, officials said. Police arrested up to 300 people after the riot.
""Minority ethnic groups are like wild horses that are difficult to tame,"" a government official in Beijing said.
""They could gallop away at any time...regardless of how well fed they are,"" said the official, speaking anonymously. ""Like a centrifugal force, their tendency is to move away.
""Ethnic minorities are an old problem, a big problem and a difficult problem to solve,"" the official added.
This month's Moslem riot was one of the largest and most violent demonstrations for independence in the mainly Moslem region of Xinjiang -- which means New Frontier in Chinese -- since the communist takeover in 1949.
Xinjiang, bordering Afghanistan, Pakistan and three mostly Moslem Central Asian states, was shaken last year by bombings and assassination attempts.
Tibet has been rocked periodically by riots led by Buddhist monks and nuns loyal to the Dalai Lama, who fled into exile in India in 1959 after an abortive uprising against the Chinese.
China accuses the Dalai Lama, who won the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize for his non-violent campaign for autonomy for his homeland, of fomenting unrest in Tibet.
Extremities committed during the chaotic 1966-76 Cultural Revolution in Xinjiang and Tibet have contributed to the resolve of ethnic minorities to try to bolt, analysts said.
Han Chinese, who account for more than 90 percent of China's population of 1.2 billion, have been accused of trying to dilute the cultures of Uighurs and Tibetans.
Uighurs were banned from learning their written language in the Cultural Revolution. ""It's like hacking them with a knife. They'll never forget the wound,"" the government official said.
Han Chinese have had more success assimilating other ethnic minorities. The proud Manchus ruled China from 1644 to 1911, but few Manchus can read or write their own language.
A natural divide in looks, lifestyle, language was to blame for much ethnic unrest in more far-flung regions, analysts said.
Uighurs, like their Central Asian cousins, speak Turkic, are Moslems and abstain from pork, a main staple for Han Chinese.
""There's a big difference in the lifestyle, food, language, customs, costume and culture of Han Chinese and Uighurs. These are natural barriers,"" the official said.
China blames ""hostile foreign forces"" for much of the ethnic unrest. Kazakhstan is home to many exiled Uighur separatists.
China also has repeatedly accused Western countries of supporting Tibet's Dalai Lama.
""But why are there no disturbances in Inner Mongolia?"" one analyst asked in reference to China's northern region, populated mainly by ethnic Mongolians. ""That is because Mongolia did not extend its arm into China.""

3575,"China and South Korea negotiated on Friday over the defection of a top North Korean who has taken refuge in Seoul's mission in Beijing while Pyongyang officials said they aimed to persuade the defector to return.
Talks in Singapore between South Korean Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha and Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen failed to break a deadlock over the defector, Hwang Jang-yop, 73, the most senior Pyongyang official to flee the North.
In Beijing, however, a South Korean embassy official said negotiations had begun over Hwang, who spent a second night in the embassy compound with an aide as Seoul and Pyongyang both made hectic efforts to claim him.
China has been dragged unwillingly into the row between an old communist comrade and a new business friend.
Diplomats have said China may find itself with little option but to give in to the wishes of the defector, thus angering one of its last remaining socialist allies.
Beijing tried to play for time.
""This incident happened all of a sudden, so we need more time to investigate,"" China's Qian told reporters after a 50-minute meeting with Seoul's Yoo in Singapore.
He urged both Koreas ""to treat this matter with a cool and calm manner, to keep peace and stability"".
Yoo said the two sides would meet again, but did not say where or when. He said Friday's talks were ""good"".
In the sedate, tree-lined diplomatic district of Beijing, dozens of Chinese police cordoned Seoul's consular section off for a second day. Hwang arrived at its door on Wednesday to seek asylum.
""They (North Koreans) are harassing us and we are a little nervous about that,"" said South Korean embassy spokesman Chang Moon Ik, adding that Seoul had asked Beijing to maintain tight security around the compound.
Hwang, who could face summary execution or a lifetime in the gulag if he goes back to the North, was in good health and sleeping well, Chang said. He was spending the day reading.
A North Korean official standing outside the police cordon said Pyongyang had no plans to storm the compound to recover a countryman Pyongyang says was kidnapped.
""We are waiting here for him to come out and then ask him to come back,"" said the official who declined to identify himself.
A group of about 10 North Koreans, badges of the late North Korean leader Kim Il-sung pinned to their lapels, returned to wait in freezing temperatures outside the compound on Friday after police asked them to leave overnight.
""If China allows him to go to South Korea then we will be disappointed,"" said another North Korean. ""It will be regrettable.""
Some commentators have suggested Pyongyang might react violently to the defection of a man ranked 24 in its hierarchy, who is a senior aide to reclusive leader Kim Jong-il and North Korea's top communist party theoretician.
Pyongyang has charged that Hwang must have been kidnapped, and has called on Beijing to sort out the mess.
Seoul has dismissed as ""preposterous"" Pyongyang's charges that Hwang, one of 11 secretaries on the powerful secretariat of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party, was abducted.
It was not clear whether Kim Ha-jung, a special adviser to South Korea's Foreign Minister, was meeting Chinese officials.
Kim failed to hold talks with Chinese officials when he arrived on Thursday as Beijing, apparently angered by Seoul's decision to export its latest row with Pyongyang into China, avoided a meeting, South Korean sources said.
Officials at the North Korean embassy refused to comment or confirm reports from Seoul that Pyongyang had sent a delegation to China to discuss Hwang's defection.

3578,"China said on Sunday its soaring stock markets were overheating on widespread speculation and warned of a crash similar to the great Wall Street collapse of 1929.
""Currently, China's stock markets are overheated, making us associate it with the U.S. stock disaster in 1929,"" the official People's Daily newspaper said in a commentary, issued in advance of its Monday edition by the Xinhua news agency.
China's foreign currency B share market in Shanghai soared by about 80 percent between November 11 and December 10 while the bourse in the southern boomtown of Shenzhen rose by about 100 percent before sharp falls in the final days of last week.
The Shanghai B-share market plunged 12.26 percent on Friday while its Shenzhen counterpart dived 14.75 percent. The Shanghai A-share index lost 5.51 percent and Shenzhen 4.84 percent.
""The stock markets have entered a very abnormal situation fraught with increasing market risk,"" said the commentary.
Anticipating sharp falls in the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets in response to the article in the People's Daily, which is the mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, the commentary said: ""The government... will never step in to help the markets when they slump.""
The commentary described speculation that the government would support the market against falls because of political considerations before the handover of Hong Kong to Beijing in mid-1997 and the Communist Party congress late next year as ""very muddled"".
Bank savings were ""the safest and most reliable method of investment"", it said in an apparent bid to talk down trading.
Last Friday, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges announced that they were imposing a limit of 10 percent on daily movements for stocks with effect from Monday to stop extraordinary price movements.
That move was clearly intended to forestall a possible crash on Monday following the People's Daily policy announcement.
""Recent skyrocketing has been very abnormal and irrational,"" the commentary said. ""We must further check excessive speculation.
""We must strengthen supervision and regulation.""
The commentary announced a list of measures to try to rein in the bull run, saying that bank loans, for example, must not be used to speculate in stocks.
The government would increase share issues by listing more profitable medium and large state enterprises, it said.
One factor in the bull run over the past month has been a lack of shares, resulting in a large number of buyers chasing a limited supply of shares.
In addition, market irregularities have been rising this year, the commentary said.
It cited manipulation by big players, bank loans entering the market illegally, overdrafts by brokerages and misleading media reports as among reasons for the skyrocketing of the stock markets in recent weeks.
Last week, securities authorities suspended the rights of two key unidentified newspapers to release official information about listed companies because of ""mistakes in reporting"".
The Securities Commission announced on Sunday a quota of 10 billion yuan ($1.2 billion) worth of share issues for 1996. The amount was 200 percent larger than the 1995 quota, Xinhua said.
The quota, if unused by the end of 1996, could be carried over into next year. Xinhua did not specify whether the quota included foreign currency B shares and domestic A shares.

3583,"A Chinese court on Thursday rejected a plea of insanity by a bank robber and sentenced him to death, along with two accomplices, for a string of heists that shocked Beijing.
In a rare move, officials allowed foreign reporters to watch the court proceedings against Guo Song and seven accessories, apparently to trumpet the success of a crackdown on crime launched this year.
The stocky Guo appeared unrepentant, his face set and defiant, as he was led from the courtroom by two policemen after the Beijing Number One Intermediate People's Court convicted him of robbing three bank cash delivery vans this year.
""The court does not believe or accept defendant Guo Song's plea of insanity,"" the presiding judge said in his verdict.
""After psychiatric tests, Guo Song was found to have total control over his mental faculties and was responsible for his actions during the crime,"" said the judge, whose name was not available.
The 32-year-old defendant, dressed in a beige jacket and dark blue trousers, did not speak during the 20-minute hearing. He has two weeks in which to file an appeal to the Higher People's Court.
The presiding judge stood to read the verdict against the eight defendants lined up in front of him and each flanked by two police officers who held their arms at their sides.
Guo, who had previously served a four-year term for rape, was found guilty of three bank robberies in Beijing in February, June and August this year, and of shooting dead four bank guards.
The robberies shocked the Chinese capital, where bank heists had been unheard of since the 1949 communist takeover.
The court sentenced two co-defendants to death for selling firearms to Guo.
A fourth defendant was given a death sentence suspended for two years and a fifth was sentenced to life imprisonment for selling firearms.
Three others, including Zhang Ying, 25, were sentenced to prison terms of up to seven years for harbouring a criminal. Zhang was the lone woman among the defendants.
Police tracked down Guo last September after police detained an accomplice of Guo's in the robberies, Lu Xianzhou, while he was driving a stolen car, state media reported.
Lu confessed to robbing the cash delivery vans and customers of banks and led police to Guo. It was not known if Lu has been sentenced.
Police had recovered six guns, 350 rounds of ammunition and part of the stolen cash -- 170,000 yuan ($20,000), 610,000 Japanese yen ($5,000) and $18,000.
Hundreds of thousands of people have been arrested and several thousand executed since China launched its Strike Hard crackdown against crime last April.
Crime, virtually eliminated after the communists swept to power in 1949, has staged a comeback in the past two decades, springing up along with economic reforms that have loosened central controls while opening up opportunities for abuse of power.
Illegal possession of firearms and gunrunning are widespread in China. The crime rate has soared, and 395 policemen were killed in the line of duty in 1995.

3588,"China said on Sunday it will tighten inspections of imported animals and plants next year for possible diseases after Chinese quarantine officials banned poultry imports from several U.S. states and a part of Britain.
""The country's animal and quarantine authorities will carry out stricter inspection on a wide range of goods,"" the China Daily Business Weekly newspaper said.
Inspections would cover imports and exports of plants, animals, fruit and agricultural goods, as well as containers, packages and other materials used to transport them, according to new regulations approved this month by the State Council, or cabinet.
Quarantine and customs officials would inspect both hand-carried items as well as goods imported or exported by traders, the newspaper said.
Pets and plants of diplomats who have diplomatic immunity would also have to be inspected, it said.
The authorities could slap fines of up to 50,000 yuan ($6,000) on violators, the newspaper said.
Agricultural officials would be on the lookout for animal and plant diseases at home and abroad, it said.
Last week, China announced a ban on poultry imports from Missouri and Oklahoma, alleging that five cases of Newcastle disease were discovered in the two U.S. states between July and September.
The United States denied the accusation and said it sought talks with China to lift the ban.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in Beijing said the disease broke out in pet birds only, and that all the pet birds infected with the disease were destroyed.
The spokeswoman said she had no information on which U.S. states found pet birds with Newcastle disease or when the problems were discovered.
The newspaper said China banned in July poultry imports from an unidentified area of Britain it believed was affected by Newcastle disease.
In October, China announced a ban on imports of poultry from 10 U.S. states because of fears it carried a virus called highly pathogenic avian influenza. But the ban did not go into effect after China and the United States held talks on the issue.
China is the second-biggest market in the world, after Russia, for U.S. poultry products.
Some 330,000 tonnes of U.S. poultry products -- worth $445 million -- were exported to China through Hong Kong last year, according to the U.S. Poultry and Egg Export Council.
Every day, 700 tonnes of U.S. chicken feet are transported across the border from Hong Kong into China, the council said.
Beijing and Washington are also at odds over textile imports, and that dispute has threatened to spill over into the farm sector.
China had threatened to ban some U.S. farm goods -- as well as textiles and alcoholic drinks -- in retaliation for U.S. penalties on textiles purchased from China.
Beijing said it was delaying by one month the implementation of those curbs, which had been scheduled to take effect December 10, because the two sides were planning to hold further talks on the issue.

3593,"Selling motorcycles used to be a joy ride for the giant, military-founded China Jialing Industrial Co Ltd, but then it ran into real market competition and growth slowed down sharply.
""Up until 1995, we sold as much as we produced,"" said Tian Min, deputy director of financial affairs at the Shanghai-listed firm, in which the Chinese government has a 75 percent stake.
But Jialing, China's biggest motorcycle manufacturer and a former munitions manufacturer that began making civilian products in 1979, saw rival manufacturers mushroom across China in 1994 and 1995 to cash in on its market.
Cutthroat competition slashed prices and profits and swelled stockpiles last year.
""In 1996, we could not sell what we produced,"" Tian said in an interview at Jialing's headquarters in China's wartime capital of Chongqing in southwestern Sichuan province.
Jialing's sales plunged to 3.5 billion yuan ($421.7 million) in 1996 from 4.6 billion yuan in 1995. After-tax profits tumbled to 270 million yuan in 1996 from 460 million yuan in 1995.
""Sales in 1994 and 1995 were good and many seeing this jumped aboard,"" Tian said.
China has about 300 motorcycle plants with total annual production capacity of 20 million units, but only 10 make more than 100,000 a year.
China is the world's largest motorcycle maker, churning out 7.83 million units in 1995, but selling only 6.1 million.
Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji has called for moves to curb blind investment in industries that appear profitable.
Blind investment is being repeated in many sectors, such as colour televisions, washing machines and refrigerators. Production has outstripped demand, leading to overheated competition, price wars and mounting losses among state firms.
Adding to the problems of motorcycle manufacturers, some regional governments, alarmed at traffic congestion and air pollution, have discouraged motorcycle purchases by curbing the issue of licence plates.
TIGHT MONETARY POLICY TO BLAME
Tian also blamed the company's woes on the government's tight monetary policy to rein in galloping inflation.
""The motorcycle market shrank...because people have less money...and less buying power,"" he said.
Tight monetary policy has also resulted in triangular debt, or debt owed among state-owned firms, and cash flow problems.
""Debts owed to each other are very serious...We can't get our money back for motorcycles sold,"" Tian said.
Jialing's collectibles soared to 700 million yuan in 1996.
The company has formed debt collection squads and aims to reduce collectibles to 300 million yuan by end-1997. Collectibles were virtually non-existent in 1994.
STRUGGLING TO REMAIN NUMBER ONE
The climb to the top is hard. Staying on top is even harder.
A price war has forced Jialing to slash prices by an average of 13 percent in 1997, Tian said. The price cut was expected to reduce sales by 400 million yuan a year.
Sales staff would receive commissions linked to performance instead of a fixed salary to try to increase sales, he said.
Jialing will curb waste and cut stockpiles, now 80,000-90,000. It is inviting tenders to force competition among parts suppliers and expects to save 300 million yuan in 1997.
Its motorcycle engines are produced at a joint venture plant with Japan's Honda Motor Co Ltd.
Sales were forecast to hit 4.2 billion yuan in 1997, while profits would be ""no lower"" than in 1996, Tian said.
Jialing would produce 1.35 million motorcycles in 1997 from 1.13 million in 1996. It has capacity for 1.7 million.
Its 1995 output of 1.1085 million motorcycles accounted for 14 percent of the national total of 7.83 million. Jialing's output was forecast to hit two million in the year 2000.
AMBITIONS RISE BEYOND MOTORCYCLES
Jialing has ambitions to do more than produce motorcycles.
It has applied to issue H shares in Hong Kong to raise funds to expand into car production, financing and pharmaceuticals.
The company wants to set up a non-bank financial institution to finance motorcycle sales, Tian said.
To meet the challenges of China's fledgling market economy, Jialing, like many state enterprises, must tackle overstaffing and the burden of cradle-to-grave welfare for its employees.
Jialing plans to lay off about one percent of its 12,500 employees in 1997, with the accumulated figure hitting 3,000 in the year 2000, Tian said.
""We're not like capitalist countries...we can't just abandon them,"" Tian said. ""We have to help them to find new jobs...or it'll bring problems to our social order and stability.""

3595,"China has pledged to open its insurance, stock, retail, wholesale and banking sectors to foreign investment as part of a drive for long-delayed entry to the World Trade Organisation.
""From 1997-2000, China is expected to open its insurance and stock market wider to foreign investment,"" the China Daily said Sunday, quoting Ma Jixian, an official of the State Economic and Trade Commission under the cabinet.
The pledge was contained in a unilateral action plan submitted by China to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in the Philippines last month, the newspaper said.
Before the end of the decade, foreign insurers would have access to markets outside Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, Ma said without elaborating.
China's insurance market was once virtually monopolised by the state-owned People's Insurance Group but the sector has gradually opened up to domestic as well as foreign competition.
Only three foreign insurers are able to write insurance policies in China, including American International Assurance Co. Ltd, a part of the American International Group Inc.
The others are Japan's Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Co. Ltd and which has a life insurance joint venture with a domestic insurer.
Ma, one of China's representatives at the APEC summit, said foreign stock companies would be allowed to handle A shares, whose availability is still confined to native Chinese. He gave no further details.
Currently, foreign investors are restricted to buying B shares, while Chinese nationals can only buy A shares.
In its action plan, China also pledged to cut its average import tariffs to about 15 percent from the current 23 percent.
The tariffs would be reduced futher in subsequent years, Ma said without going into details.
""A majority of non-tariff measures will have been abolished by 2010 and all those incompatible with World Trade Organisation rules will have been erased by 2020,"" Ma said.
China has pushed to gain entry to the WTO on the favourable terms of a developing nation, but Western countries, particularly the United States, have insisted its economy is too big for such preferential treatment.
According to the action plan, China would allow foreign banks to open more operational outfits in 24 Chinese cities and launch pilot bases where foreign banks can conduct yuan business, the newspaper said.
In the first decade of the next century, foreign banks would be allowed to expand their presence beyond the current 24 pilot cities and more pilot bases would be available for them to conduct yuan business, it said.
China would let overseas retailers establish more joint venture or cooperative retailing chains in areas beyond the 11 pilot cities currently allowed, the newspaper said.
The liberalisation would cover all provincial capitals and major economic cities by the year 2010, the newspaper said, adding that foreign retailers would be free to open outlets in China by 2020.
Foreign investors would be allowed larger stakes in China's power sector and have greater access to China's river, marine and road transportation if Beijing becomes a member of the WTO, it said.
China would further open its tourism sector, allowing joint venture travel agencies in five cities on an experimental basis over the next three years, the newspaper said.

3601,"China's People's Liberation Army (PLA), poorly regarded by many in Hong Kong, will send an advance party into the territory next Monday, more than two months before Beijing formally resumes sovereignty.
Hong Kong unexpectedly announced an accord on the troop movement on Tuesday, ending months of deadlock over the size and role of a PLA advance guard, and whether they would bear arms.
""The two sides of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group have reached agreement on the arrival of 40 advance personnel of the future Garrison in Hong Kong from April 21,"" said a Hong Kong government spokesman.
""They will not be armed and will not enjoy any special legal status or...privileges and immunities,"" the spokesman said.
""This agreement provides a firm basis for the smooth transfer of defence responsibilities.""
But the PLA advance guard will have no defence or security role and their work will not affect the British troops who will garrison Hong Kong up to the handover at midnight on June 30.
It was the first positive news after weeks of wrangling between Britain and China over a controversial shadow legislature, Beijing's plans to curb civil liberties, and China's move to set its own rules on Hong Kong residency rights.
The PLA advance guard will prepare the facilities for the PLA garrison due to take over defence duties from the British army's ""Black Watch"" regiment on July 1. The PLA garrison might eventually be up to 10,000-strong, military sources say.
""The duties of advance personnel are to make practical preparations for the PLA to take over the responsibility for the defence of Hong Kong, including familiarisation with military sites, liaison with British forces and the Hong Kong government, and coordination of communications support,"" the spokesman said.
The group will be led by a deputy commander of the future Garrison, an officer of the rank of Major General.
A 28-member liaison group led by the deputy commander will be located with British forces at the Prince of Wales Barracks in Central Hong Kong. The other 12 will be billeted with the British garrison on Stonecutters Island in Hong Kong harbour.
The PLA troops would wear uniforms within the barracks but civilian clothing outside military sites.
""They have to strictly abide by all Hong Kong laws,"" the spokesman said in an effort to allay fears among Hong Kong's 6.4 million population that the PLA would put itself above the law.
The PLA has a bad name in Hong Kong, where many people vividly remember how the Chinese army sent tanks into Beijing's Tiananmen Square and bloodily crushed a student-led democracy movement with a heavy loss of life.
China has reinforced those fears and memories with a series of moves designed to trim democracy and civil liberties in Hong Kong after the sovereignty change this year.
It has overridden British objections and appointed a new interim legislature to replace the elected Legislative Council on July 1, when 156 years of British rule come to an end and Hong Kong becomes a semi-autonomous capitalist region of China.
It has also launched moves to roll back laws on the freedom to demonstrate and form political parties, as well as democratic elections introduced by London in recent years.
The latest breakthrough came just as the mood was growing bleak in Sino-British handover negotiations.
A move by Beijing on Monday to set the rules on who is entitled to permanent residency in Hong Kong after it reverts to China had stirred up a bitter quarrel.
""It's our domestic affair. We don't need the British to tell us who is a Chinese national,"" China's Hong Kong policy boss Lu Ping said. Britain promptly accused China of going it alone on an issue that should have been settled diplomatically.

3603,"Hong Kong's future government has hit a new snag, with a shortage of trained staff forcing it to cancel a sitting of a controversial legislature preparing new laws ahead of the territory's handover to China.
It is the latest in a series of difficulties facing Tung Chee-hwa, the China-backed shipping magnate who will rule Hong Kong after the British pull out at midnight on June 30.
Tung's office said on Wednesday that this Saturday's session of the provisional legislature, which had been scheduled to deal with a draft law on new flags, had been dropped from the diary. Just a briefing would take place.
""The draft bills aren't ready because there aren't enough people,"" Bob Howlett, a spokesman for Tung's office, told Reuters. He said Tung's coordinator, Michael Suen, concluded the office did not have enough draftsmen to prepare planned laws.
""He doesn't want to see a rushed job done on anything,"" Howlett said.
But Tung's office issued a statement saying the bills would be passed in good time before the July 1 handover.
""We are doing the best we can with our limited resources. We are firmly committed to completing the drafting of all essential bills in good time for their passage by the Provisional Legislature Council before July 1.""
British Governor Chris Patten has refused to second more staff to the Tung office from the Hong Kong civil service to help the future government ready itself for the handover.
The office has only two law drafters on its staff.
Communist-ruled China resumes sovereignty over Hong Kong, a British colony for the last 156 years, under a 1984 treaty that allows the territory virtual autonomy for another 50 years.
China, angered by democratic reforms introduced by Patten in the twilight years of British rule, set up the provisional legislature in December to replace the democratically elected Legislative Council (Legco).
Many of China's critics consider the interim body unconstitutional.
""I think it's a good thing there's now no legislation going forward this week, and it would be even better if no legislation goes forward at any time, because anything they do handle between now and June 30 is vulnerable to legal challenge after the first of July,"" said Patten's spokesman, Kerry McGlynn.
""That can't be in anybody's interests. We've always made it perfectly plain, and will continue to do so up to June 30, that we'll do nothing to undermine the credibility and legitimacy of the current Legco by providing any kind of assistance to the provisional legislature,"" McGlynn told Reuters.
A spokesman for the provisional legislature said the body would now organise a briefing on Saturday on the planned civil rights curbs, instead of a full-fledged legislative session, at its base in the Chinese border town of Shenzhen.
Tung's run-up to his new job as Hong Kong chief executive has been a bumpy one.
Sino-British disputes were stoked this month after Tung launched a plan to curb political liberties such as the right to protest and the right of political groups to receive foreign funds. He provoked a domestic and international outcry.
Last week he admitted to the media that he had donated 50,000 stg ($81,500) to the ruling British Conservative Party in 1992, sparking cries of hypocrisy.

3605,"A Hong Kong legislator will present the government on Wednesday with a demand to press China to clarify the role of the Communist Party in Hong Kong after this year's handover.
The question of Communist Party activity, a taboo subject for decades, would be raised at a session on Wednesday of the Legislative Council by independent democrat Christine Loh.
Loh's question, published in advance by the council, will ask the government to press Beijing and Hong Kong's leader-to-be Tung Chee-hwa on how the party will be represented, what its role will be, what channels of communication it will have with the Tung government, and the limits on this liaison.
Loh wrote in an article supporting her latest move that she hoped to break down the ""wall of silence"" about the party.
""Past efforts to broach the subject publicly have been greeted not only with stony official silence from the Hong Kong government, but with dismay and anger in other quarters that sometimes verged on the hysterical,"" she said.
""How can we possibly still pretend that the Chinese Communist Party doesn't matter in Hong Kong? The most dire speculation is that it will operate in Hong Kong after 1997 much as it does in China,"" she said. ""Such political arrangements would be disastrous.""
The territory is set to revert to China on July 1 after a century and a half as a British colony. When the flag changes, it is to become a highly autonomous Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China, with its own distinct capitalist system.
But Beijing's plans to slash civil liberties and democracy, and the constant involvement of Chinese government officials in crafting the incoming government, have cast doubts on this autonomy and left many in Hong Kong fearing communist-style controls.
The British, Chinese and Hong Kong governments have largely avoided discussing the presence in Hong Kong of the ruling Chinese Communist Party, which took power in China in 1949.
It is an open secret that party authority is represented by the de facto Chinese embassy, the Xinhua News Agency branch, headed by senior Communist official, Zhou Nan, effectively the party's ""First Secretary"" in the territory.
The party's operation working out of the Xinhua office is known as the Hong Kong and Macau Work Committee.
But the party has operated in an underground way for decades. Its cells have been linked to anti-British riots in the 1960s during China's radical Cultural Revolution.
Tung said last year he would legalise the Communist Party after he becomes the territory's chief executive on July 1, if asked to do so, equating it with any other political party.
The remark raised eyebrows among Hong Kong's 6.4 million people because the party in China wields absolute power and permeates every layer of civil and military organisation.
So far, China has indicated Beijing's most senior officials in Hong Kong will be a top diplomat, expected to be China's current ambassador in London, Jiang Enzhu, and the garrison commander, General Liu Zhenwu.

3608,"Hong Kong's popular Democratic Party on Thursday welcomed a pledge from the territory's future leader, Tung Chee-hwa, that people would keep their basic freedoms after China takes over on July 1.
But some activists staged a noisy protest disrupting a meeting staged by Tung's aides to tap the public's views on his controversial plan to whittle down civil liberties.
A new opinion poll, meanwhile, indicated nine in 10 of Hong Kong students do not believe China will really allow the territory its promised autonomy after Britain hands it back.
Fears have been rising in Hong Kong, a British colony for more than 150 years and now with 6.4 million people, that the territory will suffer a loss of freedom after the handover.
Tung on Wednesday vigorously defended proposed curbs on the right to demonstrate and on foreign funding of political groups, saying laws in the United States were much tougher.
""The majority of cities in North America, including New York, Washington and San Francisco, all require police permission before demonstrations can be held,"" he said.
""Let me assure you the (future) government has the strongest determination to preserve the freedoms that the people of Hong Kong currently enjoy,"" Tung said in a dinner speech.
""Peaceful and lawful demonstrations can and must be allowed to continue. I see public demonstration as a way for people to express their views, and public demonstrations are now a part of Hong Kong culture,"" he said.
Anthony Cheung, vice president of the Democratic Party cautiously welcomed Tung's assurances, the first public comment Tung has made on the proposals launched last week.
""We welcome this pledge that the right to protest, the right to demonstrate, the freedom of assembly and association, all of these are people's rights and should be part of Hong Kong's political culture,"" Cheung told Hong Kong radio.
""But we question a lot of the substance of Mr Tung's proposals on how to amend the Societies Ordinance and the Public Order Ordinance,"" he said. ""Some of these proposals have in fact infringed the rights that Mr Tung was talking about.""
About 16 pro-democracy councillors waved banners and shouted slogans, disrupting a public consultation on the plan at Hong Kong's Space Museum on Thursday. They then walked out of the meeting, attended by 50 members of local councils.
""We believe this is a fake consultation,"" said councillor Ng Wing-fai. ""The members of the future government already have a basic line and the basic principles will not be changed.""
Colonial Governor Chris Patten made clear on Wednesday that Britain would not back down on an issue at the heart of handover quarrels with China -- a shadow legislature that China has appointed to replace the current, elected Legislative Council.
Patten opposed calls to allow the China-appointed body to pass a law on residency rights before the hand-back to China.
His comment followed a row this week when China announced rules on who would qualify for ""right of abode"" -- permanent residency -- in Hong Kong after the handover.
But a pro-China group on Thursday marched to Government House, Patten's residence, to rebuke the government for not cooperating with the future administration, the local Pearl television station reported.
Brandishing banners and chanting slogans, members of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong said they wanted the interim chamber to pass the right of abode bill.
Beijing plans to submit the bill before June 30 to its Hong Kong provisional legislature.
The government said if the bill were to be handled before July 1 by the interim body it would be legally challenged.

3613,"Political controversy struck Hong Kong on Thursday when future leader Tung Chee-hwa lashed out at critics who tarnished Hong Kong's image, and Britain attacked China's plans to roll back democracy and human rights.
""Recently, some well-known people, including the Democratic Party, have blackened the reputation of Hong Kong overseas... giving the impression that Hong Kong is collapsing,"" Tung said.
""Is there the need to go abroad to blacken the name of Hong Kong? Is there the need for foreigners to come to Hong Kong and tell us, the Hong Kong people, what to do in the future?"" Tung told reporters as he opened offices that will be his base until Britain hands the colony back to China at midnight on June 30.
The former shipping magnate's attack on those who ""talk down"" Hong Kong and frighten investors was directed primarily against Martin Lee, leader of the popular Democratic Party, which is campaigning against a new legislature appointed by China.
Lee, rounding off a 10-city tour of Europe, told Hong Kong radio after hearing Tung's remarks that Tung must do more to defend the territory of 6.3 million people against Beijing's Communist rulers.
""We want Mr Tung to change the unhappy fate that awaits Hong Kong...talk to the Chinese leaders, get them to wind up that appointed illegal legislature.
""Then our worries will be over and overseas investors will be very happy to come to Hong Kong and invest more,"" Lee said.
Tung said there were different views about the ""need for balance between individual rights and order in society"".
""But in future, I hope our friends will sit down here in Hong Kong and talk things through,"" said the post-colonial ""Chief Executive"", who was appointed by a China-controlled committee.
British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, who is in Singapore for talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and will visit Hong Kong this weekend, again condemned Beijing's plan to install a ""provisional legislature"" in place of Hong Kong's elected Legislative Council on July 1.
He said it clashed with a 1984 handover treaty and with the constitution covering Hong Kong's handover.
""We believe the establishment of the provisional legislature certainly goes against the spirit and indeed may be a severe breach of the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law.""
The European Union's envoy in Hong Kong said negative press coverage of Hong Kong had created a misconceived ""doom and gloom"" scenario.
""This is a public relations disaster,"" envoy Etienne Reuter told reporters. ""They believe that after July 1 there will be no freedoms and human rights in Hong Kong.""
The president of the shadow legislature, Rita Fan, sought to reassure Hong Kong people this week they had nothing to fear when the territory becomes a ""Special Administrative Region"" of China. Under the handover treaty, China has promised wide-ranging autonomy and 50 more years of freewheeling capitalism.
""To be fair to ourselves we should give ourselves a chance and stay put and see what happens,"" Fan told Reuters.
""I personally am very confident and convinced that we will have our lifestyle and our freedom as we have enjoyed all these years,"" she said.
Tung said that in the next few days he would announce his team of top officials to head various policy branches, the equivalent of ministers in the government of a country.
Speculation is intense on who will be kept from the present government. Tung has already said he will retain the head of the administration, Chief Secretary Anson Chan, a fellow-Shanghainese, who has agreed to stay on.
But even after he has cobbled together a government-in-waiting, he faces enormous political challenges.
His advisory cabinet, the Executive Council, which will meet in the offices he opened on Thursday, has been attacked by democrats as too pro-Beijing, and he is constantly assailed for unswervingly echoing China's autocratic, anti-democratic views.
But on a more positive note, a Sino-British negotiating team hammering out details of the sovereignty transfer, announced on Thursday they were zeroing in on an accord on a 1997/98 budget for Hong Kong that would straddle the handover.

3616,"Human rights and political liberty took centre stage in Hong Kong on Tuesday as human rights watchdogs said China was making it easier to crush dissent, boding ill for the territory after Beijing takes over.
After 156 years under the British flag, Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30 -- 63 days away -- and the pace of politics is quickening.
The watchdog Human Rights Watch/Asia said changes to China's criminal code had made it easier for Beijing to stifle dissent, and Hong Kong people might even be put on trial in China.
In Washington, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen held talks on contentious issues but there was no shift in views on human rights or the future of Hong Kong, a Chinese spokesman said.
A major ""public consultation"" on the future of political freedom in the colony ends on Wednesday, and the bustling capitalist outpost's 6.4 million people are sharply divided.
The pulse-taking launched by future leader Tung Chee-hwa asks members of the public and organisations to submit views on his plan to ban foreign funding of political groups and curb the right to protest in the interests of ""national security"".
Pro-democracy parties, the legal profession, human rights groups, Western-style trade unions and churches have all vigorously objected to the plan in written submissions, and there has been loud criticism from London and Washington.
But organisations representing industry, commerce, pro-China political parties and pro-Beijing trade unions support Tung's plan, which was forced on him in March by a Chinese parliamentary resolution.
In the latest twist, a powerful pro-Beijing labour group, the Federation of Trade Unions, urged a widening of definitions of political groups covered by the curbs.
But in an unusual move, the federation also called for a ban on funding from China's ruling Communist Party to local political groups to be added to the restrictions.
""This will avoid disputes and criticisms. Hong Kong's political groups should stand on their own feet to fight for their beliefs,"" said the union's boss, Cheng Yiu-tong.
Cheng's rival, pro-democracy trade union federation leader Lee Cheuk-yan, attacked Cheng's bid to widen the net.
""(It) is a step backward, because they want to have more organisations defined as political groups,"" Lee told Reuters. ""They want to pressure these organisations to depoliticise.""
Tung's future Justice Secretary, Elsie Leung, said she was willing to consider calls for a ban on mainland funding.
Such funding had not originally been mentioned because it was considered that the national security interests of Hong Kong and mainland organisations converged.
""But we will consider this proposal as so many people have raised it,"" she said at a function on Monday.
Human Rights Watch/Asia said in a major report on Tuesday that China's striking of the term ""counterrevolution"", the communist code for subversion, from the law books in March did not mean easing political controls. Quite the opposite.
""China has merely replaced the term 'counterrevolution' with the equally elastic notion of 'endangering state security' and has, in the process, actually broadened the capacity of the state to suppress dissent,"" the report said.
Hong Kong people, who China has vowed can keep their legal system and way of life for 50 years, could suffer, it said.
""The new security provisions will facilitate the labelling of all domestic critics as tools of 'hostile foreign forces',"" it said. ""Despite Hong Kong's separate legal system, Beijing may have the power to bring Hong Kong people to face trial in mainland courts.""

3618,"Hong Kong's 250,000-strong Catholic community looks ahead with confidence to Chinese rule but is treading cautiously in its relations with Beijing, church sources said on Tuesday.
The sources said a statement from Pope John Paul on Monday that the Vatican would closely watch how Catholics fare in Hong Kong after the British colony's handover to China in mid-1997 was a necessary expression of concern.
They believed the church would remain free after 1997.
But one said: ""Probably our future is like a lame duck -- still alive but unable to do very much. We will have to obey and stay within our political border -- Hong Kong.""
Some Catholic agencies are quitting Hong Kong in order not to endanger the community after the Chinese red flag is raised.
Hong Kong's Roman Catholics, most of them ethnic Chinese. amount to four percent of the capitalist territory's 6.3 million population.
Speaking in his annual ""state of the world"" address, the Pope said: ""By reason of the size and vitality of the Catholic community in the territory, the Holy See will follow with particular interest this new state.""
""The Pope's concern is necessary because this is the biggest Chinese diocese in the world,"" Anthony Lam, executive director of the Holy Spirit Study Centre, told Reuters.
""The relationship between the Hong Kong government and the diocese is harmonious,"" he said. The community and China must work to maintain that harmony after 1997.""
Hong Kong has been a base of missionary activity aimed at China's teeming millions since its inception as a British colony in the gunboat diplomacy of the mid-19th century.
This fact has made Beijing's Communist rulers view Hong Kong with suspicion since they took control of the mainland in 1949.
Many local Catholics have risen to senior official rank or political prominence. These include a vocal critic of the Beijing government, Democratic Party leader Martin Lee, as well as Financial Secretary Donald Tsang and anti-corruption chief Michael Leung.
Other prominent Catholics in Hong Kong include the British governor Chris Patten and Leo Goodstadt, who is an adviser to both Patten and Catholic Cardinal John Wu.
Highlighting the very different position of the church in Hong Kong from the church in China, Wu presided over a colourful annual pageant of judges in the Catholic Cathedral on Monday.
On the mainland, churches are tightly restricted through ""patriotic associations"", the Vatican is banned from appointing bishops, and China often jails dissident priests for organising religious activity outside state control.
However, church sources in Hong Kong said they believe the territory will not suffer the same fate because China pledges to allow religious freedom in the territory under its Basic Law.
""The church will stay in Hong Kong and will take a positive view towards the political transition,"" Lam said.
But one church source said: ""We've seen China reinterpret the Basic Law to suit itself. This does not bode well for freedom. They've said we can speak only about Catholics in Hong Kong, not those in China, who we care about,"" he said.
Mary Seung, director of the Catholic Social Communications Office, which acts as a spokesman for the diocese, sounded a more upbeat note, saying:
""We've had contacts with the Chinese authorities and they've guaranteed that the Catholic community can continue its work in social services and the schools.""
Hong Kong has over 300 Catholic schools at various levels.
The 1997 handover has forced churches in Hong Kong to search their political souls over the past year, with the religious community split over how much to cooperate with China.
Eight Catholics sit on the Selection Committee, a China- appointed body crafting new Hong Kong power structures.
But the church allowed them to participate only in their personal capacity, not as its official representatives.

3620,"Governor Chris Patten on Monday urged Beijing, which just released a Hong Kong reporter after three years in jail, to let reporters in the territory write without fear after it reverts to China in July.
China released prominent Hong Kong journalist Xi Yang, 40, last Saturday after he served three years of a 12-year prison term on spy charges.
""We have our own system, and journalists in our system are not put in prison for embarrassing the government by revealing things the government might not wish to have revealed,"" Patten told a conference of the Commonwealth Journalists Association.
""If it were other than that in Hong Kong, there would not be many journalists free on the streets,"" Patten said.
""The important thing is that our system, under which journalists can write without fear or favour, should continue.""
Analysts have been wondering if Xi's sudden release was an attempt by China to calm a heated debate over its plan to roll back civil liberties in Hong Kong when the territory reverts to its control at midnight this June 30.
A China-controlled panel last week listed a string of laws for repealing, including parts of the Bill of Rights and two Hong Kong laws that allow political demonstrations and the free association of groups such as political parties.
The plan has earned China rebukes from Britain, the United States and pro-democracy parties in Hong Kong.
China also plans to scrap Hong Kong's elected legislature.
On Monday, Hong Kong democracy activists staged a small but noisy protest outside China's de facto embassy to demand the release of at least 13 dissidents recently reported to have been jailed or arrested in southwestern Guizhou province.
The dissidents had been accused of counter-revolutionary activities linked to their pro-democracy campaigning.
""We are afraid that our freedoms and liberties will be infringed in the future,"" said activist Andrew To, who led the demonstration outside the Xinhua News Agency office.
About 20 members of a Hong Kong alliance supporting China's beleaguered democracy movement organised the protest.
With shouts of ""set free the dissidents"", some 20 activists waved a banner with the slogan, ""oppose Chinese communists jailing dissidents"", as police watched.
A protest organiser, Lau Shan-Ching, said China's release of Xi was marred by the latest news about jailed dissidents.
""We see China release Xi Yang, but then we see China has arrested 13 dissidents. So we see China does not change its attitude on human rights,"" Lau said.
""After the handover, there may be some dissidents in Hong Kong put into jail,"" he said.
Patten, meanwhile, said censorship was an even bigger threat to the press than the danger of being locked away, and he hoped Beijing would notice the reaction to Xi's release and the value Hong Kong people place on freedom.
""Self-censorship or censorship at the news editor's desk is probably more of a realistic threat in tomorrow's world -- I don't say necessarily in Hong Kong -- than handcuffs and barred windows,"" he said.
Britain and China also ran into another snag on Monday on details of the handover, failing to agree on the size and timing of the advance party of People's Liberation Army troops that China wants to send to Hong Kong before July 1.
""The main issue, I suppose, is that we pointed out to the Chinese side that their proposals for the numbers of advance personnel are too high and timing of their arrival is too early,"" said Alan Paul, British representative at the talks.
""So we put forward a proposal of our own which we regard as reasonable, one which we hope they will consider positively and give us a positive reply at today's meeting,"" Paul said.

3625,"An American businessman is plotting a marketing revolution in the hospitality sector and aims to house U.S. pioneers in the China market.
Corporate housing specialist Howard Ruby says he aims to turn the business of letting serviced apartments into a full-fledged industry that will provide everything from Internet terminals in the home to child care and jobs for expatriate spouses.
FROM POOR COUSIN OF HOTELS TO A GLOBAL SERVICE
Until recently the sector providing ready-to-live-in, service-provided, short-term apartments was a poor cousin of hotels, and in many cities of the world it still is.
""This whole industry has been below the radar screen over the last twenty years, being done by a mama and papa, or a small operator that operates one building at a time,"" said Ruby.
""And now we're seeing an industry evolve because of the needs of corporate clients as business globalises around the world,"" the head of Los Angeles-based Oakwood International said in an interview at a recent hotel industry conference.
EYES ON ASIA AND CHINA MARKETS
Ruby's group recently launched a joint venture with a subsidiary of Australia-listed Lend Lease in Singapore with plans to provide 10,000 serviced apartments in Asia, and intends to take aim at London during the next year.
Ruby foresees large-scale expansion in the sector in the Far East, especially in China, with much of American industry abuzz with plans to move people into the region.
Chinese cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou have large expatriate populations as well as large numbers of home-grown professionals moving around the country on assignment who need temporary serviced housing.
""I just finished a tour of major client companies in the United States. Every single one is planning an expansion into the Far East, with most of them talking about China.
""Telecommunications, software companies, all the way through to clothing and furniture manufacturers. They're all talking China right now. Whereas a company might have sent 10 people last year, they're expecting to send over 20 people this coming year,"" he said.
The serviced apartment industry is starting to break away from the niche market identity and family-style business of old into a multifaceted service industry, Ruby believes.
CORPORATE RELOCATIONS PROVIDE HUGE MARKET POTENTIAL
Oakwood is the largest national provider of serviced apartments in the United States, with offices in 60 cities, more than 17,000 apartments and 25,000 clients including 400 of the Fortune 500 companies and 75 of the world's top multinationals.
The potential of the business is highlighted by one client that carries out 50,000 relocations of staff a year, with an average three months stay in temporary housing, Ruby said.
A company like General Motors, for example, might need help with relocation or temporary housing for staff moved around on training, special projects like setting up new production lines and might put out 25,000 apartment requirements a year.
Ruby started out catering to the niche market of new college graduates three decades ago -- apartments for baby boomers.
He moved on to corporate housing when companies asked for more services, such as maid service and taking care of bills.
SERVICED APARTMENTS TO BECOME MULTIFACETED SERVICE
He sees the business progressing to include video conferencing, Internet hookups, sports and recreation facilities, orientation tours, child care and job search agencies for spouses.
""This way a serviced apartment offers a branded service dedicated to the needs of the corporate customer. They are not just a physical facility, but a service provider,"" he said.
""Companies do not want staff transfers to end in failure because of a dissatisfied spouse. So we want to provide a service that makes a transfer a success.""
With an increasingly cluttered market, customers looked now to a reputable brand as their one point of contact, Ruby said.
DEALS IN THE PIPELINE IN ASIA
In the Far East, Oakwood and partners are working on deals in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Manila and Bangkok.
The first Asian project to go onstream will be Oakwood Premier, a serviced apartment scheme in Shanghai's historic Xuhui district, where the French concession was located in pre-revolutionary times. The property, owned by a Hong Kong family, will open later this year.
""As the industry matures in Asia, dedicated service companies will be the providers of choice for the corporations leasing the majority of serviced apartments,"" Ruby said.

3628,"An overture by China to bring its critics into the team picking Hong Kong's future leadership shows openness but might split the democratic camp in the British colony, analysts said on Tuesday.
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said this month the 400-member body that will choose the chief executive and legislators who will run the territory after its July 1, 1997, transfer to China could include people with divergent views on democracy.
His remark at a Beijing meeting was taken in the colony as an olive branch towards Hong Kong's popular Democratic Party, which so far has been excluded from transition arrangements.
Although pegged to the acceptance of China's plan for an appointed ""provisional legislature"" to replace the current fully elected council, the remark was in stark contrast to China's harsh invective against the party over the past year.
The gesture is also fuelling heated discussion in local political circles and newspaper columns about China's motives.
""It might be an attempt to split the democrats, but more probably Beijing has realised that they've failed to split them so far and it's time to get them on board,"" Hong Kong University political analyst Nihal Jayawickrama told Reuters.
""I'm sure there are elements in the Democratic Party who will feel the urge to respond positively,"" he said.
But Democratic Party leader Martin Lee last weekend rejected the idea of joining the Selection Committee, saying that would amount to recognition of an illegitimate body.
The party argues that China's plan to scrap the present legislature and appoint a new ""provisional"" one has no basis in law or in the handover treaties with London.
""So long as China insists that any participant must assist in both selection processes -- Hong Kong's future chief executive and the provisional legislature -- I can't see how they can get the democrats on board,"" Jayawickrama said.
But he said it was likely the temptation would prove strong for some of Lee's associates and that they would quit the party.
China is very eager to give the Selection Committee a greater air of legitimacy by including some democrats, some China analysts in Hong Kong believe.
""At the end of the day, it's a question of who gets into the committee. And I don't think people like Lee or (deputy party leader) Szeto Wah would get in even if they are nominated,"" political commentator Andy Ho told Reuters.
The leaders of the party, the biggest in this territory of 6.2 million people, have drawn Beijing's wrath since 1989 when they sided with the student-led, pro-democracy movement that Chinese army tanks crushed in Tiananmen Square.
""We shouldn't jump to the conclusion that China has changed its position towards the Democratic Party,"" Ho said. ""It just wants to create an impression of openness.""
Some of China's Hong Kong advisers differ in their view of Qian's remarks. Tsang Yok-Sing, a pro-Beijing politician, has said he did not see them as an invitation to the democrats.
Emily Lau, an outspoken independent democrat who has often riled China's communist rulers, interpreted Qian's comment as a brazen effort to drive a wedge into the democratic movement.
Qian had divided the pro-democracy camp into ""people who are prepared to compromise their principles and those who will stand firm"", Lau wrote in a column in the South China Morning Post.
""With the scramble for seats on the Selection Committee having begun in earnest, it will rapidly become clear that some members of the pro-democracy camp are eager for a place... These people have long been itching to open dialogue with Beijing and are now only too eager to be given recognition,"" Lau wrote.

3643,"Tsang Yok-Sing, the leader of Hong Kong's biggest pro-China party, had his baptism of fire in the violent riots that shook the territory during China's Cultural Revolution of the 1960s.
Tsang was out on the streets during Hong Kong's 1967 riots, waving Chairman Mao Zedong's ""Little Red Book"", distributing leaflets and marching in the frontline of anti-British demonstrations.
Tsang, a bright light in the new political regime that will replace British colonial rule in Hong Kong on July 1, was shaped by the indignity he felt about the Chinese not being masters of their own home in the territory for more than 150 years.
The 49-year-old school headmaster makes no bones about the real quarrel between Britain and China over Hong Kong's return to Beijing's control. It's not the widely publicised polemics or legal wrangles about human rights and democracy, he says.
For Tsang, it's ""the end of British rule -- the end of the institutions elected under the British constitution"".
CULTURE CLASH
It's a culture clash, the clashing of national prides.
The Chinese are fired by the desire to shake off the last vestiges of an imperialist, colonial yoke, while the British rue their loss of an empire on which, once, the sun never set.
""The Chinese government has never really believed the British were happy to return Hong Kong to China,"" Tsang told Reuters in an interview.
""Most people in Hong Kong believe Hong Kong is part of China, that the territory should return to China, that British colonial rule should come to an end.""
And end it will, at midnight June 30, when the Union Jack is furled and China's red flag is raised over a capitalist Special Administrative Region (SAR), to which China has promised a high degree of autonomy under a ""one country two systems"" principle.
Tsang Yok-sing is a man of humble working-class origins and a solid leftwing family. His parents moved to Hong Kong in 1949 as the Communists swept to power in a civil war in China. His brother, Tsang Tak-Sing, is the editor of China's propaganda mouthpiece in Hong Kong, the daily Ta Kung Pao newspaper.
Tsang is the principal of the Pui Kiu leftwing junior school in Hong Kong's North Point, once a bastion of leftwing ferment.
He is chairman of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB), which lost heavily to the immensely popular pro-democracy Democratic Party in legislative elections in 1995.
The DAB holds six seats in the elected 60-member Legislature but has scored nine seats in a provisional legislature which China plans to install on July 1 in place of the current chamber. The new body is packed with pro-China party members.
BROTHER, SISTER JAILED DURING RIOTS
Tsang recently wrote a graphic account of his early life including his involvement in the political mayhem that rocked Hong Kong during China's Cultural Revolution.
""When the 1967 riots broke out I was already a committed Marxist and I was in total sympathy with the workers who were only protecting themselves against the oppressive colonial government of the time,"" Tsang wrote.
""I was deeply affected by the dramatic events of '67. My brother, aged 18, was arrested during the riot and locked up in Stanley Prison for two years, and my sister was imprisoned for a month, aged only 15. Don't talk to me about human rights.""
""My experiences drove me more to the other side. I worshipped Mao Zedong and he became my idol.""
Tsang made secret visits to China via Macau during those years and developed contacts on the mainland. He then abandoned a plan to study in the United States and went to work instead in the leftwing school where he is now principal.
MAO'S DEATH DIMS YOUTHFUL REVOLUTIONARY SPARK
But the spark of revolutionary youth dimmed when Mao died and his associates were arrested in 1976.
""I and my colleagues at the school felt very cheated after the fall of the Gang of Four...The Mao craze died down.""
But patriotic leftwing feeling was rekindled as China opened up in recent years, and as interest grew in the approaching return of Hong Kong to the motherland.
The 1989 Tiananmen square pro-democracy protests in China drew one million sympathisers on to the streets in Hong Kong.
Tsang joined in the protests against the Chinese government, ""but I still believed we could maintain a dialogue with the Chinese authorities.""
TIANANMEN TURNING POINT
It was in the wake of Tiananmen that Tsang and colleagues decided to form his political party, one which would help promote ""one country two systems"", without hostility to China.
He has shoved his Marxist-Leninism onto the backburner and argues China's ongoing remaking of itself and its transformation into a market economy bode well for Hong Kong.
""I cannot see any reason to be pessimistic about Hong Kong's future. We can't convert the pessimists, but we can let history prove itself.""

3645,"The death of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping has had an impact in Hong Kong unseen since the 1976 passing of Mao Zedong, founder of communist China.
But it pales in comparison to the outpouring of grief that followed Mao's death, long-term residents say.
An estimated 50,000 people have visited China's official mission in Hong Kong, the Xinhua news agency building, to pay their respects at a Deng shrine in the five days since the Chinese patriarch's death last Wednesday.
Some segments of the British-ruled community of 6.4 million people also saluted Deng with gestures of mourning at the moment of his official Beijing funeral on Tuesday.
Ships blasted their horns, buses trailed black ribbons, train stations broadcast dirges, flags flew at half mast, and schoolchildren stood at attention in respectful silence.
Deng, purged by Mao before becoming China's unquestioned leader in 1978, orchestrated China's opening to the West and its economic reforms, as well as Beijing's blueprint for taking back Hong Kong from Britain on July 1.
Mao died in 1976 after a rule marked by numerous purges of the communist leadership and revolutionary upheavals climaxing in his disastrous 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.
Still, hundreds of thousands in Hong Kong mourned his passing, long-term residents said.
""With Mao, huge numbers of people poured into a hall crying. It was very mournful,"" said Hong Kong politician Elsie Tu.
""It brought tears to our eyes as we felt the end of an era,"" said the 83-year-old Tu, a former missionary in China.
Long-term resident and former China-watcher John Dolfin said the turnout for Mao was massive and the salutes ear-splitting.
""The lines curled three abreast around the Bank of China building, and all through the park. There must have been thousands in the line at any given time. It took an hour and a half to get in,"" said Dolfin.
""The line was much smaller for Deng. It was very quick. And there wasn't much emotion,"" Dolfin said.
""For Mao every boat in the harbour stopped and blew their whistles. It was deafening. But today the harbour was virtually empty when the whistles were blown.
""Chairman Mao very much still held authority when he died, unlike Deng, who frankly was not really the 'paramount leader' for a number of years and held no official positions of power when he died,"" Dolfin said.
Szeto Wah, a pro-democracy politician and critic of Beijing, recalled Mao's mammoth personality cult.
""The reaction for Mao was much stronger than for Deng because he was like a god. It was like the death of a god. All of China felt helpless,"" said Szeto.
""People went to mourn Mao at the Bank of China building. The atmosphere was very grievous but also very nervous because the Cultural Revolution had not yet finished,"" he said. ""An important difference was that there had not been any news about Mao's condition, whereas Deng's condition has been frequently reported before he died.""
Arthur Hacker, a long-term Hong Kong resident and former government information officer, recalled 1976.
""They dismantled the enormous sign on the top of the Bank of China building which said 'Chairman Mao Lives Forever',"" he said.
""Everybody went to the Bank of China, opposite the old cricket club. Xinhua was very invisible in those days,"" Hacker said. ""There were wreaths all over the bank's wall, and queues of people. There were red flags all over the place.""

In November, Boral said it would maintain a 7.5 cents per share dividend for the December half, the same amount it paid in the 1995/96 second half.
Boral paid a 10.5 cents dividend in the 1995/96 first half.  
Although analysts were in a narrow range for the first half result, forecasts for the 1996/97 full year varied from A$163.8 million to A$190 million for pre-abnormal net profit.
Boral reported a net profit before abnormals of A$170.9 million for the year to June 30, 1996.
Shares in the Sydney-based group have traded in a range between A$2.91 and A$3.70 since June 1996, when they were around A.

3655,"Australia's second largest telecom carrier Optus Communications Pty Ltd said on Wednesday it expects a strong result for the June 30 year and still aimed for a sharemarket float in 1997, despite litigation delays.
Optus also formally reported a net profit of A$58.9 million in the six months ended December 31, 1996, up from A$7.1 million a year earlier. The result was first announced last week by its 25 percent shareholder Mayne Nickless Ltd.
""We are expecting a very strong result for the full year,"" Optus chief executive officer Ziggy Switkowski told reporters.  
Optus reported a profit of A$60.3 million for the 1995/96 year, which compared with a loss of A$17.0 million in 1994/95.
Sales rose 31.2 percent to A$1.19 billion, buoyed by a strong lift in revenue from its mobile business.
Chief operating officer Phil Jacobs told Reuters he expected sales to continue the strong trend in the 1996/97 second half.
""It will be somewhere by a similar amount,"" Jacobs said.
Switkowski said Optus still planned a sharemarket float in calendar 1997, but a float would have to await the outcome of the litigation between its 46.5 percent owned associate Optus Vision and television station Seven Network Ltd.  
Asked at a media briefing if Optus Communications would put off its float past this year, Switkowski said: ""No, not at all the float is clearly held up by the process of the litigation, once the litigation is resolved, the board will meet and make decisions about how the float should proceed going forward.""
""The timetable for this year is still very much our desire,"" Switkowski said.
However, Switkowski said there was a possibility that Optus' planned float may clash with the timing of the sale of one third of government owned Telstra Corp, which would be a far bigger capital raising than Optus.  
""It does appear that the Telstra float will be at the latter part of the year, so when our schedule is clarified and indeed when the Telstra schedule is clarified, we will have a look at what that means to us,"" Switkowski said.
""It is not impossible that those floats will happen about the same time, we will see later this year,"" he said.
Switkowski would not comment on the litigation between Optus Vision and Seven or Vision's local telephony services launched mid-1996 to break Telstra A$5 billion market monopoly.
But Optus' Jacobs said Optus Communications had other strategies besides using Optus Vision for the local call market.  
Optus Communications has pumped about A$605 million into Optus Vision, which is currently rolling out its cable network to 2.5 million homes or 40 percent of Australian households.
""It has never been Optus Vision's intention to cable up to 100 percent of Australia's population,"" Jacobs told reporters.
""It has been our intention as Optus Communications to offer our services to a wide a customer base as possible and we have from the very beginning looked at a multiple strategy to get to those customers,"" Jacobs said.
If Optus Vision loses its legal battle with Seven, Optus forced to sell its Vision stake at a discount to Seven.  
Jacobs said the full deregulation of Australia's telecom market on July 1, 1997 would put pressure on margins across all of its businesses, but this would be more than offset by growth in the overall telecommunications market.
""There is no doubt that there will be erosion in some areas of our business as competition comes in...but we fully expect that erosion of share would be more than offset by the continued growth of the business,"" Jacobs said.
Optus is also owned 24.5 percent each by Cable and Wireless Plc of Britain and U.S. telephone carrier BellSouth Corp Inc. The remainder is owned by Australian institutions.

3656,"APEC ministers agreed on Friday on further trade and investment liberalisation in the telecommunications sector, but recognised they cannot drag China into the forum's agenda of trade liberalisation.
""There has been an agreement by all economies to adopt the strategy of going towards open trade and liberalisation in the trade in telecommunications,"" Australian telecommunications minister Richard Alston told reporters.  
The Australian minister said China was connecting 15 million telephone lines a year, but still had one of the lowest penetration rates of fixed telephone lines amongst members of the APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) forum.
""The challenges and the enormity of scale of operations of that country can hardly be compared to countries such as PNG (Papua New Guinea) and Brunei ... and so that is why you would have to allow for different views,"" he said at the end of the three-day meeting.  
Alston said he was also hopeful that Malaysia, which was the only member of the APEC group not to come to the meeting, to attend future meetings.
Malaysia did not attend the initial APEC telecommunications ministers meeting in Seoul in 1995.
""We would all hope Malaysia will over time see the benefits that derive from collective discussions,"" Alston said.
""I think the high level of interest amongst the 17 economies, that will benefit Malaysia, even in absence.""  
Alston, who hosted the second APEC ministerial meeting on telecommunications and the information industry, said APEC could not push member countries to conform to a uniform policy.
""It is not a regional government. It is not intended to drag unwilling players along a path that the majority thinks desirable,"" said Alston in reply to a question about reports that China was reluctant to adopt telecom liberalisation.
""Whilst there might be some domestic reservations about particular aspects, the overall guiding principles are well recognised. You simply don't find a member economy that does not espouse the principles of the reforms in this area,"" he said.  
Although there were no tangible projects to come out of the meeting, ministers agreed on further collaboration on working groups to look at telecommunications for rural development, distance education, information sharing and the environment.
""It would be very short sighted if we simply committed ourselves to physical rollout without taking into account the effect to the natural environment,"" Alston said.
Alston said rapid technological change in informational technology and telecommunications had thrown up new challenges, such as dealing with the acceptance of electronic commerce and taxation issues that go along with it.  
""Undoubtably there will a reluctance to fully embrace electronic commerce and all of its manifestations, until we do solve problems of privacy,"" Alston said.
Alston said he expected electronic commerce to be a growing industry once encryption and security issues had been resolved, but taxation issues will start become more important.
""It hasn't yet reached the stage of being an avalanche of siphoning off the revenue from the taxation authorities, but it clearly has some potential in that regard and I think all member economies are aware of the need to handle the issue,"" he said.  
The next meeting of telecom ministers is in Singapore in mid-1998. APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.

3661,"The Australian government appointed stockbrokers on Thursday to manage the proposed sharemarket float of its telecommunications carrier Telstra Corp, which will be the nation's largest privatisation.
The float is estimated to raise a minimum of A$8.0 billion (US$6.32 billion) -- and perhaps much more.
Finance Minister John Fahey said he wanted the Telstra float, through the sale of a third of the government's 100-percent stake, to go through by the end of the year.
""I want it ready to go to the market this year, this calendar year,"" Fahey told reporters.
""But I am not saying it will,"" he said. He added it was unclear whether the float of other international telephone companies would affect the float timing. France Telecom and Italy's state-owned Stet are also planned for sale this year.
Australian brokers J.B Were &amp; Son, U.S.-based CS First Boston and European based ABN AMRO/Rothschild had been appointed global co-ordinators for the float, Fahey said.
He said J.B Were, Ord Minnett of Australia,  CS First Boston, U.S.-Australian consortium Goldman Sachs/Macquarie Bank, Daiwa of Japan, ABN AMRO/Rothschild and German owned Deutsche Morgan Grenfell were appointed joint lead managers.
The float would not be underwritten in Australia, where 65 percent of the offer is to be sold. But the shares offered in the United States would be underwritten and listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the minister said.
Two percent of the offer is set aside for Telstra employees and foreign investors are entitled to 35 percent.
Fahey would not comment on how much the government expects to raise from the partial sale of Telstra. ""I want to get optimum value for taxpayers of Australia,"" Fahey said.
Australia's Liberal-National Party coalition government was elected just over a year ago promsing to sell one-third of Telstra, with A$1.0 billion of the sale proceeds going to set up an environment fund.
The float of Telstra will far exceed other privatisations by the Australian government in recent years. The sale of Commonwealth Bank of Australia raised a total of A$8.0 billion, in two separate tranches, and the 1995 float of Qantas Airways Ltd raised A$1.45 billion.
The announcement was a boon to Australia's stockbroking community whose Christmas bonuses will be swelled by the Telstra float. The bidding for the Telstra deal was contested by 30 broking firms, which were invited to lodge proposals.

3663,"Muhammad Yunus may have the travel itinerary and packed schedule of an international banker, but that is where the comparisons stop.
He wears not pinstripes, but the traditional, billowing Bangladeshi panjami. He eschews five-star hotels and stays instead with friends and supporters around the world.
Yet Yunus is Bangladesh's most successful banker, a man who has gained international renown for doing the unthinkable.
Yunus is head of Grameen Bank, which makes money out of lending money to some of the world's poorest people. Ninety-four percent of Grameen's borrowers are women, and the bank makes loans to people with no collateral or credit rating.
To the traditional banker this may sound like financial suicide, but Grameen has attracted more than two million customers since it started in 1976 and its lending philosophy has spread to over 50 countries.
Yunus, founder and managing director of Grameen Bank, says his strategy works -- 98 percent of loans get repaid, a banker's dream, and most borrowers escape from their poverty trap.
""Our goal is to take the poor people out of poverty as many ways as possible,"" Yunus told Reuters during a visit to Australia to meet Grameen supporter groups and politicans.
AID GOES TO BUREAUCRACY, NOT POOR
Some of the world's biggest bankers are now listening to Yunus's cry against poverty. The World Bank has appointed him chairman of its policy advisory group in its lending programmes to the poor.
The world's first Micro-Credit Summit, held last month in Washington, set out to ensure that 100 million of the world's poorest families, especially women, receive credit by the year 2005. A large part of the credit programmes will be based on policies used by the Grameen Bank, which is 92-percent owned by its borrowers. The rest is owned by the Bangladesh government.
The formation two years ago of CGAP (the Consultative Group to Assist the Poorest), with the financial backing of the World Bank and European Commission, is an endorsement by the World Bank of Yunus's vision.
The CGAP has a budget of US$291 million to set up micro-lending banks around the world. Yunus wants to make sure all of this money reaches the people that need it and that it is not chewed up by bureaucracy.
""We are saying exactly US$291 million should reach the hands of the poor people and you make the minimum out of service charges and we are suggesting a mechanism to do that,"" he said.
""Most of the aid money gets dried up in the servicing of the aid. I am not blaming the bureaucracy itself. I am simply saying the design is wrong,"" said the former economics professor.
The world aid system also has its faults, Yunus told Reuters before a public lecture to a packed unversity audience.
BUBBLE UP, NOT TRICKLE DOWN
If he is not giving lectures in foreign countries he is receiving prizes or honorary degress and meeting supporters.
Each year about US$60 billion is given in aid by the World Bank and other government agencies, but these funds fail to meet their market -- the poor, Yunus said.
This aid has been given to large infrastructure projects on the trickle-down economic theory rationale, but these do not create sustainable employment, said the U.S. educated banker.
Yunus' idea for Grameen Bank came when he returned to newly-independent Bangladesh in 1972 to become head of the economics department at Chittagong University. He found that the theories he was teaching were not working -- just outside the university walls people lived in squalor.
Almost half of Bangladesh's 112 million people live below the poverty line and about 68 percent of the population are illiterate.
The 57-year-old banker knew that poverty was not due to laziness or lack of intelligence but a lack of capital in order to raise cows, make stools or pedal rickshaws.
Grameen Bank now has 12,600 staff who visit 36,000 of Bangladesh's 68,000 villages each week to meet their 2.1 million customers. In 1996 the bank loaned about US$400 million with the average loan at $150. The bank has two loans -- a one-year self employment loan and a 10-year housing loan.
MICRO-CREDIT ONLY PART OF SOLUTION
""It (capital) is a very important part of alleviating poverty, but it is not the only one,"" said Yunus, tipped by United States President Bill Clinton as a future Nobel Peace Prize winner.
""But other pieces become easier to fit in when you have created this centrepiece, then you can add the health piece, you can add education,"" said Yunus, who also plans to provide health care insurance, solar heating and cellular telephone services to Grameen customers.
""Our goal is to get these 2.1 million families out of poverty in the next five years in Bangladesh,"" Yunus said.
""Worldwide we shall look for a day when all the poor people are out of poverty.
""If it can be done in Bangladesh with 2.1 million families, it can be done worldwide. It is just a question of will.""

3668,"Upmarket retailer David Jones Ltd, expected to report a sharp fall in half year profit on Wednesday, is shopping around for a new chief executive just as retailing conditions are expected to turn for the better.
Analysts said Chris Tideman who resigned as CEO on Tuesday was the victim of a weak retail environment at a time when David Jones was spending more on opening new stores and restructuring.
David Jones has disappointed investors since it listed in November 1995 with its failure to match prospectus forecasts.  
""I think the cycle worked against them,"" a Melbourne retailing analyst said.
""They have underperformed the cycle and that is a bit of a shame. That reflects the costs of the new store openings.""
Analysts said Tideman may have been trying to do too much at one time. David Jones was introducing new systems to manage its inventory as well as increasing its range of private label merchandise and restructuring its buying department.
The retailer had also restructured its South Australian operations and announced plans to expand into Western Australia and New Zealand.  
""They have committed themselves to a lot of new stores and so far the new stores they have opened up ... are loss making and they have committed themselves to other new stores so their cost structure is a bit pumped up,"" said Simon Shakesheff a retail analyst at Macquarie Equities.
David Jones' share price has hardly been above its A$2.00 issue price since the float. The group is due to release its results for the 26 weeks to January 25 on Wednesday.
In January, the retailer said it expected its results to be up to 50 percent down on a year ago.  
Tideman cited personal reasons for leaving and the company said he would return to Britain.
Analysts expect David Jones to report a net profit before abnormals of between A$20 million and A$22 million.
The dividend is expected to be about three cents a share for the 1996/97 first half.
David Jones reported a net profit before abnormals of A$44.2 million for the 1995/96 first half and a dividend of six cents a share. Analysts estimate the full 1996/97 year result to be between A$34 million and A$38 million.  
The retailer reported a net profit of A$67.53 million in the 1995/96 year, which was up on the 1995 prospectus forecast of A$64.6 million, but its 1995/96 sales were below forecasts.
Analysts were mixed about the outlook. Some said the new chief had a tough job ahead due to re-invigorated Coles Myer Ltd owned Grace Bros-Myer department stores and the entry into the local market by Britain's Marks &amp; Spencer.
But other analysts said Australia's retail outlook for 1997 had improved and that the restructuring of David Jones was almost complete, meaning the new chief should not have as bumpy a ride as Tideman since he joined the group in 1994.  
""It could be a dream job, coming in at the bottom of the cycle and six months away from full systems implemention,"" said John Burgess, a retail analyst at Pru-Bache Securities.
""We have had two bad Christmases in 1995 and 1996,"" Burgess said. ""You will reach the bottom of the spending cycle in the next two quarters, so you have spending on the rise, albeit slowly, towards the end of 1997,"" he said.
Analysts said David Jones may even announce the new chief executive on Wednesday. Investors reacted positively to Tideman's exit, pushing up the shares by three cents to A$1.74. About 1.21 million shares had traded by 2.15 p.m. (0315 GMT).

3671,"Building products group Boral Ltd shares topped the turnover charts on Friday as investors ploughed into the building material sector on the back of a change of sentiment for the recently depressed housing sector.
Boral shares jumped 13.6 cents or 3.71 percent to close at A$3.806 on a turnover of 8.8 million shares. The shares ended off their intra-day high of A$3.91, which was their highest level since March 1994.
Fellow building material groups Pioneer International Ltd and CSR Ltd also recorded strong gains.  
Pioneer shares closed at their highest level since the 1987 sharemarket crash, up 14.4 cents or 3.55 percent at A$4.20, while CSR shares ended 14 cents or three percent higher at A$4.81, its highest level since August 1994.
""I think there is just a lot of sentiment around the stocks, people want to get set for the upturn,"" said Chris Haynes, a building materials analyst at broker BT Securities.
Australian housing finance data due out next Thursday are expected to show further recent evidence that the industry is set for an upturn after a two year depression, with construction activity picking up by mid-1997.  
""There is no doubt in people's mind that the physical cycle has turned and that should have been evident three or four months ago, but it takes a while before people are convinced,"" said John North of J.B Were &amp; Son.
Analysts said institutions may have been behind the heavy share trading in Boral, as not many major insitutions have the stock in their portfolio.
""The thing with Boral is that no major institution is on the register, so there are some people who are a little bit worried by not having any of the stock,"" BT's Haynes said.  
Both Boral and Pioneer recently reported lower profits for the six months to December 31, 1996. CSR reported in December.
On Tuesday, Boral reported a net profit of A$93.16 million for the 1995/96 first half, down from A$169.71 million in the 1995/96 first half, but it said it expected a higher profit for the second half to June 30.
Last week, Pioneer reported a net profit of A$112.7 million for the first half, down from A$138.0 million a year earlier.
But, Pioneer said it expected a lower full year profit due to lower returns from its investment in petroleum refiner Ampol.  
However, the current corporate earnings season is seen as reporting mainly in line results with many better than expected results. Analysts said the solid earnings season is also a reason for the change in sentiment for the cyclical stocks.
""The reporting season has significantly decreased the risk attached to the future profit outlook for the sector,"" said Fabian Babich at ABN AMRO Hoare Govett.
Babich said there was also evidence that volumes are up.
""So if volumes are going up and you have achieved costs savings and you have sold off underperforming businesses, what is going to happen to your profits?...they are going to go up.""  
The only Australian building material group to miss out on the big price jumps was James Hardie Industries Ltd, which had prior to today being the strongest share price performer in the sector ove rthe past 12 months.
James Hardie shares rose one cent to A$3.84 on Friday.
""Hardie is more of a growth story, the others are more of a cyclical story,"" JB Were's North said.
Australia's building material index jumped 2.57 percent and was one of the few rises on Friday with the broader All Ordinaries index down 8,9 points to 2,438.5 points.

3692,"Australia's biggest gambler Kerry Packer, a patron of Las Vegas casinos, on Monday raised his stakes in the local burgeoning casino industry with the acquisition of management control at Sydney Harbour Casino.
Packer's media group Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd (PBL) said it would spend A$340 million (US$265 million) on a 10 percent stake in Sydney Harbour Casino Holdings Ltd (SHC) and 85 percent of the management contract of the casino from U.S. casino operator Showboat Inc.
PBL's investment both in the management contract and the shares of SHC would show very attractive financial returns over time, PBL chairman Brian Powers said in a statement.
""This transaction represents a major move into the gaming industry for PBL and provides us with an ideal base from which to build a substantial business in this dynamic industry,"" Powers said.
""This advances our strategic goal of building a third core business alongside our television and publishing businesses,"" he said. PBL also has a option over part of Showboat's remaining 16.1 percent stake in SHC.
Showboat president and chief executive officer Kell Houssels said in the statement the transaction provided an opportunity to realise a superior return on its investment, while maintaining a major ownership position in the Sydney casino.
Packer, Australia's richest man, has sought control of the Sydney casino for the past three years. In 1994 Packer led a consortium to bid for the 12-year Sydney casino licence, but lost out to the Showboat led consortium in December 1994.
Since losing the Sydney casino license bid, Packer interests have launched several legal actions against Showboat for the award of the licence by the New South Wales (NSW) government.
Packer's punt on SHC shares have already made him a profit as shares in both the casino owner and PBL rose strongly after the deal was announced before Monday's sharemarket open.
In early afternoon trade, SHC shares were at a record high of A$2.27, a 34 cent or 17.61 percent rise in active trade, while PBL shares were 25 cents higher at A$6.35.
The deal was good for both companies as Packer's influence was likely to yield a tax-concession for the casino on the high-roller market, which is seen boosting cash flow for both the casino and PBL, Australian market analysts said.
SHC owns the only legal casino in Australia's largest city and has battled the New South Wales state government for the past 16 months to get a similar tax rate to other Australian casinos.
""I think Packer will probably get the tax-break from the government,"" one Sydney-based casino analyst said. ""I expect there will be some tax-break announcement this month,"" he said.
The Sydney casino is seeking a 10 percent tax concession from the state government on big spending gamblers, mainly from Asia, compared with the present tax rate of 27 percent.
PBL is also expected to end the disappointing run of operating results the casino has reported since it opened a temporary casino in September 1995. The casino is expected to open a A$1.0 billion permanment casino later this year.
Packer also has a 10 percent stake in Melbourne casino operator Crown Ltd and about 20 percent of Hudson Conway Ltd, which in turn owns 37 percent of Crown.
""Given the Packer-Hudson Conway type of relationship it looks like there is a bit more to come out of this one,"" said Richard Wolf, a casino analyst at Bell Securities.

3696,"Business demands for cheaper telephone services will propel liberalisation in the telecommunications markets of the APEC region, a U.S. telecommunications official said on Friday.
Larry Irving, a telecommunications adviser to U.S. President Bill Clinton, said the biggest advocates of change of telecommunications law were business leaders looking for better service and lower prices.
""The biggest proponent is not the telecom companies it is the industrialists, who are demanding better services and cheaper prices,"" said Irving, who is head administrator of the National Telecommunication Informational Agency (NTIA).
""It is becoming a competitive edge, countries cannot afford not to liberalise their telecom markets,"" Irving told Reuters at a meeting of APEC telecommunications ministers in Australia.
Countries that liberalise telecommunications markets would create more telecom-related jobs than those retaining state-owned monopolies, he said, citing Chile, Mexico and New Zealand as APEC countries with open telecommunications markets.
Irving said 400,000 jobs were created in the United States last year in telecommunications and information technology industry or about one-fifth of all new jobs in the U.S. economy.
Chile's Undersecretary of Communications Gregorio San Martin Ricci said more jobs have been created in his country's telecommunications industry since the South American nation deregulated the market in the late 1980s.
""There are now nine companies providing local telephone services and six firms provide long distance calls, compared with two companies in the late 1980s, which has meant more jobs,"" San Martin told Reuters in an interview.
A deregulated telecommunications market has also made Chile more internationally competitive, the Chilean minister said on the last day of the three-day meeting of ministers of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC).
""Before our markets used to be so far away, because we are right down the bottom of South America, but with good telecommunications our customers are now very close and distance is no longer a problem,"" San Martin said.
Fellow Latin American delegate, Carlos Mier Y Tieran, director general of Mexico's telecommunications department, said his nation also took steps in the 1980s to deregulate its telecommunications market in order to become more competitive.
""There is no question that it has made us more competitive, but we realised we had to open it to private investment because we could not afford to do it ourselves,"" Mier Y Tieran said in an interview.
Mier Y Tieran said about US$11 billion had been invested in Mexico's telecommunications market over the past six years.
""In many ways Mexico has a geographical advantage, we are a neighbour to the biggest market in the world, the United States, we are part of APEC on the Pacific coast and Europe on the Atlantic side, and we are historically connected to the rest of Latin America, but to take advantage of this we need good infrastructure and if we don't we will lose out,"" he said.

3698,"Seven Network Ltd's managing director Gary Rice said on Wednesday that he expected a slightly better performance in the second half of 1996/97 than a year earlier.
""I think in relative terms, I would expect to see a slight improvement in general performance terms in the second half,"" Rice told Reuters in a telephone interview. Asked if he saw a better performance for the whole year, Rice replied: ""Yes.""
Seven earlier reported a 31.5 percent fall in net profit to A$62.98 million in the 26 weeks to December 28.  
Asked if the advertising market would be stronger overall in 1996/97 compared with 1995/96, Rice said: ""I think it will be marginally better than last year - difficult to call at this point."" He added there was signs of improvement in advertising from some sectors.
He said Seven has no plans for further major cost cuts at the network. In October, the broadcaster retrenched 43 staff in an effort to streamline costs.
Seven invested US$250 million in Hollywood studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) for control of the studio with United States billionaire Kirk Kerkorian late last year.  
MGM reported earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of US$16.7 million in the period from October 10 last year to December 31 on an operating revenue of $228.7 million.
""We are very happy with the progress at MGM,"" Rice said.
Seven's second half result is traditionally weaker than the first half.
The network, which is 20 percent owned by its chairman Kerry Stokes, reported a net profit of A$115.13 million for the 1995/96 year, compared with A$41.26 million a year earlier.
But Seven did not account for tax in these two years.  
Seven, which is also 15 percent owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd, said although it does not expect to pay tax for another two years, accounting standards required recognition of this income tax expense in the half year results. It said tax amounted to A$34.3 million in the half.
Sales rose 16.3 percent to A$418.28 million in the six months to the end of December.
At 2.05 p.m. (0205 GMT), Seven shares were one cent down at A$4.12, but were firmer than the level before the results were released.

3701,"It began with a whimper, culminated in an economic explosion and was one of the most far-reaching events of the 20th century.
Deng Xiaoping's 1992 move to kick-start an economy faltering after the 1989 Tiananmen massacre strengthened his conservative opponents was a high point of his career and launched an economic boom that has reverberated around the world.
In January 1992, Deng, then 87, toured the boomtown of Shenzhen that borders Hong Kong in what has gone down in history as his ""nan xun"" or Southern Tour.
For more than two months not a newspaper in China's Communist Party controlled media machine published even a word of Deng's unprecedented visit, underlining the extent to which China's paramount leader -- by then retired from all formal posts -- had lost control of the powerful propaganda apparatus.
Hardline leftists who opposed Deng's bid to place his stamp of approval on the flourishing Shenzhen Special Economic Zone that was his brainchild blocked for weeks any news of his tour.
But in late March of that year, Deng and his loyalists succeeded in pushing aside the propaganda tsars and his ""Southern Tour"" burst upon the Chinese public through primetime state television and splashed across whole pages of state-run newspapers.
It marked the start of a new era in the reform process that Deng had launched in 1979.
That southern tour unsheathed a double-edged sword of rising incomes and galloping inflation but many Chinese said on Saturday they were much better off than in the pre-Deng era.
""Mao made the Chinese stand up but Deng made us rich,"" said Yang Baisong, a 41-year-old taxi driver in Beijing.
""I can make 8-9,000 yuan ($960-$1,080) a month,"" Yang said. ""That's pretty good and this car is my own.""

Deng, always impatient with economic reform, had acted out of deep frustration with the slow pace of economic change after hardliners regained the offensive in the wake of the bloody crackdown on student-led pro-democracy dissent in Beijing's Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989.
Opposition to reform had come from top level bureaucrats, Marxist purists and Deng's own gerontocratic peers whose power and privilege stemmed from four decades of central planning.
The media barrage of March 1992 marked a strategic turning point in Deng's campaign to outflank conservative opponents in the capital.
At the same time, it exposed his own weakness in that he had to head south to areas where reform had found their strongest hold to push his agenda because he was unable to win a hearing in the bastion of conservativism in Beijing.
The Southern Tour marked an unprecedented interference in the political process and revealed China's worst-kept secret -- that he was the man really running the country.
It was Deng's first public appearance in more than a year -- he had deliberately faded from the scene to boost the stature and credibility of his chosen heir, Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin who was appointed after the Tiananmen Square crackdown.
In scarcely-veiled criticisms in Shenzhen, Deng revealed the extent of his disappointment with his anointed successor and with Premier Li Peng -- both too weak or too conservative to press the radical economic change that Deng believed was the only way to ensure the party retained power.
""We should be even bolder than before in conducting reform and opening to the outside and have the courage to experiment,"" he said in Shenzhen.
""We must not act like women with bound feet,"" he said.

3708,"China's President Jiang Zemin, speaking publicly for the first time since the death of Deng Xiaoping, vowed on Friday to push forward the reforms that his mentor launched 18 years ago.
""The Communist Party of China, the Chinese army and people of various ethnic groups are determined to turn grief into strength,"" Jiang told Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who is on holiday in China.
Speaking for the first time in public since Deng died, aged 92, on Wednesday, Deng's designated heir pledged to ""hold high the great banner of Deng's theory to build socialism with Chinese characteristics"".
China would unite to pursue Deng's reforms and opening up ""unswervingly and confidently"", the Xinhua news agency quoted Jiang as saying.
Jiang repeated almost word for word the official obituary of the pragmatic reformer whose belief that China's people should be allowed to get rich ended a decade of chaotic rule by Mao Zedong, who believed his people should be ""red"" -- communist.
However, it was Jiang's first personal and public commitment that he planned to press on with Deng's capitalist-style reforms that have transformed China from a backward Stalinist state to an economic powerhouse.
""We would run China's undertakings still better, and make greater contributions to the cause of peace, development and progress of the mankind,"" Jiang was quoted as saying.
The death of Deng was ""an immeasurable loss"" to the Party, army and people of China, Jiang said.
Jiang, who also holds the posts of Communist Party chief and head of the armed forces, emerged on Deng's death to rule China after seven years in waiting as his heir apparent.
Diplomats say Jiang may soon find himself embroiled in a power struggle with other pretenders to power in the highest echelons of the ruling party.
China's leadership has carefully displayed a united front.
China-watchers say this may be a facade.
""It'll be like a duck swimming -- on the surface it'll be calm but underneath it'll be turbulent,"" said one Chinese analyst, quoting a Chinese proverb.
In imperial China, the transfer of the ""mandate of heaven"" to a new emperor was rarely smooth. Deng only came to power in late 1978 after a two-year battle with Mao's appointed successor, Hua Guofeng.
The latest power shift has so far been seamless, but analysts said later upheavals could not be ruled out.
Jiang's first test will be at the crucial 15th Party Congress, which is expected to be held in October and is to elect a new central committee, politburo and party chief. The post of party chief, or general secretary, is the most powerful in China.
At least one contest will be over a crusade by Premier Li Peng, 68, to try to retain his slot on the politburo standing committee -- the most powerful decision-making body in China.
Li must step down as premier in 1998, after completing the maximum two terms, and is keen to make a play for the top party post so that he can remain in the hierarchy after he retires from the government job, analysts say.

3710,"China's President Jiang Zemin issued a pledge on Saturday to outdo late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping in pursuing the capitalist-style reforms that his patron vowed would carry China through the next 100 years.
Jiang, who with Deng's death at 92 on Wednesday became undisputedly the most powerful man in China, waited a scant two days before hinting that ""the chief architect"" of reforms that have transformed the face of China in just 18 years had only started a job that he (Jiang) meant to finish.
""We would run China's undertakings still better, and make greater contributions to the cause of peace, development and progress of the mankind,"" Jiang told visiting Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev.
To ordinary Chinese, Jiang's first public words following the death of the man credited with creating China's extraordinarily successful combination of communism and capitalism were an unmistakeable rebuke.
""Of course that's a criticism,"" said a Chinese worker without hesitation.
However, Jiang was also swift to nail his colours to Deng's reforms and opening to the outside world that transformed an isolated Stalinist state into a fledgling economic superpower.
Jiang, who is also China's Communist Party chief and the head of the military, was hand-picked by Deng to be his successor and holds most of the cards needed to replace him.
But for some analysts, his swift attempt to assume Deng's personal mantle smacked of arrogance that could prove dangerous if a power struggle were to erupt.
China's secretive leadership has projected an image of seamless transition following Deng's death, mindful of the political tumult that enveloped the country following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 before Deng emerged.
But there were hints of discord even as the 92-year-old Deng lay dying.
The February issue of a magazine called Zhongliu, or Mainstay, controlled by ultra-leftists, obliquely criticised Deng's successor in what one political analyst described as ""the first cannon fired by leftists at Jiang Zemin"".
In China's arcane political world, power struggles are fought behind the scenes and traditionally emerge into the public eye only when they erupt in the state media.
The language used by the magazine was reminiscent of the chaotic 1966-76 Cultural Revolution that Mao used to purge his opponents, analysts said.
""The magazine is trying to stir up debate reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution... to oust Jiang Zemin,"" one said.
Clearly fearing a repeat of the student-led demonstrations that marked the last funeral of a party luminary in 1989, police threw a security net around Tiananmen Square in the heart of Beijing and plainclothes officers patrolled university campuses.
Deng's memorial rites are scheduled for Tuesday in the cavernous Great Hall of the People on the edge of the square.
On Saturday, a People's Liberation Army honour guard rehearsed the cremation that is expected on Monday at a special cemetery for party heroes, shouldering a glass coffin with a live soldier inside -- apparently simulating China's late paramount leader.
State television has run endless paeans to Deng and showed formal mourning activities organised by Chinese officials in Hong Kong, Washington and other foreign cities.
At home, however, China has kept official reaction to Deng's death deliberately low-key, making little attempt to organise memorial activities that might spin out of control.
In central Beijing's Tiananmen Square, site of the 1989 student-led protests smashed by the military at Deng's behest, at least two people have been detained while trying to pay final respects to the late leader.
Tens of thousands of mourners thronged to the courtyard of his birth in his home village of Paifang in southwestern Sichuan province. In the Sichuan capital of Chengdu more than 10,000 people gathered in People's Square on Thursday to mark the passing of their province's favourite son.
In the southern boomtown of Shenzhen, a special economic zone near Hong Kong where Deng first experimented with grafting capitalist-style markets on to a socialist economy, hundreds of people filed past a giant Deng billboard which had been turned into a makeshift shrine.
In Shanghai, which quickly reverted to its nimble trading ways under Deng's guidance, the city's familier profit mantra was joined by a new chant drifting skyward from the Jade Buddha Temple.
""The monks are praying for world peace and Deng Xiaoping,"" an attendant said. ""So that Deng will go to heaven.""

3717,"U.S. and Chinese negotiators were locked in last-ditch talks into the night on Saturday to try to hammer out a new textile accord and a deal on market access as a new deadline loomed for a cross-Pacific trade war.
However, U.S. officials hinted that an agreement could be virtually in the bag with negotiators expected to work virtually through the night to put the finishing touches to a final text.
Chief U.S. textile negotiator Rita Hayes said earlier she was confident of accord on renewing a 1994 textile accord and resolving a dispute over U.S. penalties on Chinese exports on the fifth day of talks with officials at China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
""We felt like we had made tremendous progress and we are looking to complete negotiations today,"" she told Reuters before leaving for the ministry. ""You're always positive you can reach an agreement but you have to balance it out.""
The United States had extended by a day the deadline of midnight January 31 in Washington (0500 GMT) for agreement on a new textile accord.
""I felt like it was important to extend it, the deadline, for one day... so we could get a fresh start this morning,"" Hayes said of the talks that went virtually without a break for 48 hours on Thursday and Friday.
""We did not complete the agreement... so we felt like we'd have one extra day to complete it,"" she said before resuming negotiations that dragged late into Saturday without agreement as a new deadline loomed.
U.S. officials had said they hoped for a deal by the end of Saturday.
The Sino-U.S. textile pact had been scheduled to expire on December 31 but was extended by one month to give both sides time to hammer out a compromise. Officials declined to say whether the threatened multi-billion penalties on China would be imposed if the deadline extension expired without accord.
Chinese officials refused to comment, saying only talks were continuing.
Washington slapped $19 million worth of penalties on imports of Chinese textiles last September, saying Beijing was shipping textiles through third countries to evade quota restrictions.
China has threatened to retaliate by temporarily banning imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods and alcoholic drinks but has delayed such action to allow time for further talks.
Hayes said the U.S. side was still focusing on two major demands -- its market access package and a level playing field for the textile industry.
""The two main things that we have been consistently concerned about are the market access that China has to the United States... and also making sure that it is balanced, that we have a market access package from China,"" she said.
Disagreement over market access in China appeared to be a major stumbling block, industry representatives said earlier.
However, they said hopes for a deal were high, with Hayes and her team believed to be putting the finishing touches to the text of an agreement.
Washington could make significant cuts to China's textile quotas if agreement could not be reached before the previous deadline of January 31, Hayes has said.
Washington and Beijing were also seeking to ease tensions in a dispute over Chinese exports of textiles via third countries.

3722,"China's new central depository has ambitious goals to clean up the chaotic state debt market and implement risk controls to prevent losses from a chain of debts, and analysts said it may have the clout to do just that.
Formally registered last month, the China Government Securities Depository Trust and Clearing Co was created by the central bank, the People's Bank of China, and the Ministry of Finance and six other shareholders with capital of 180 million yuan ($21.6 million).
""Our primary goal is to solve the problem of risk on the state debt market,"" said Wang Ping, executive vice-president of the clearing house. ""We want to bring risk down to its lowest possible level.""
Other goals include providing a centralised clearing system and uniting nationwide back office operations, Wang told Reuters in an interview.
Another major aim was to prevent borrowers wanting funds amid a national credit squeeze turning to loopholes on China's fledgling repo markets, resulting in huge levels of debt estimated at 50-60 billion yuan ($6.0-7.0 million).
The central bank planned to issue debt to clear up the outstanding chain of debt that had resulted from institutions engaging in the banned practice of turning to the repo market while holding bills worth as little as three percent of the value of funds raised, Wang said.
The clearing centre has been quietly carving out a niche for its operations aimed at regulating the chaotic and disparate system since it won a battle with Shanghai's Foreign Exchange Trading System to handle China's repo market.
Wang said the Beijing-based securities depository hoped to have united all bond and repo back office operations within 1997, and had ambitious goals for its future.
""We want to promote the merging of financial policy and monetary policy,"" Wang said.
""With the support of the People's Bank and the Ministry of Finance, we are moving toward international market practices and hope to set up a foundation for the opening to foreigners of China's debt market,"" he said.
However, he said that this target remained several years in the future and would depend on China's ability to make its yuan currency convertible on the capital account. Officials have said they would like full convertibility by the year 2000.
The securities depository also appeared poised to become the main channel through which the central bank would conduct its open market operations.
In 1996, the first year the central bank conducted open market operations, turnover was more than 4.0 billion yuan, Wang said. ""The amount this year will be significantly larger.
""The People's Bank will put into effect a double-track system of direct and indirect control,"" he said. ""On one hand it will control the scale of loans while on the other it will greatly expand open market operations and discounting.""
The central bank aimed to end direct controls by 1998, he said. It would also issue short-term debt of one-year and below maturity to trade with state banks this year, he said.
Officials declined to reveal the planned size of central bank open market operations, but some sources said turnover could soar as high as 200 billion this year.
Wang acknowledged that the new securities depository had run into some opposition, citing unidentified interest groups in some regions as well as market players who did not fully understand the need for a regulated system.
The bulk of China's state debt is traded through the Shanghai and Shenzhen securities exchanges, as well as through dozens of smaller centres scattered across China.
""So we need administrative measures to help us to do our work,"" he said.

3730,"China hit back on Saturday over a U.S. report that it had silenced all dissent by the end of 1996, voicing firm opposition to such charges and accusing Washington of interfering in its internal affairs.
""The Chinese government protects and promotes the human rights and basic freedoms of all its peoples according to the constitution and relevant laws, and its achievements are clear for all to see,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang said.
The Foreign Ministry statement was China's first response to the annual U.S. human rights report released on Thursday that accused China of effectively silencing all public dissent against the Communist Party and government by the end of last year.
""The U.S. government turns a blind eye to the facts and distorts and condemns China's human rights situation, seriously violating the basic principles of international relations,"" Tang said.
""China voices its firm opposition to this,"" he said.
""The U.S. side should stop its wrong methods of using the pretext of human rights to interfere in China's internal affairs,"" Tang said.
In the annual human rights report on 193 countries, the United States accused China of detaining, jailing or driving into exile all known dissidents.
This year's hard-hitting report was released during a dramatic improvement in Sino-U.S. ties that have long been rocked by disputes over issues ranging from rights to trade to Taiwan.
Tang defended China's human rights record, stressing that the government's human rights priority was the feeding and clothing of its 1.2 billion people.
""At present, China politics is stable, its economy is developing, its society is advancing, its ethnic peoples are united, its people are living and working in peace,"" Tang said.
""The facts prove that placing the people's rights to live and to develop in first place... fits with the basic interests of the whole people,"" he said.
Analysts said Beijing's response was unusually mild, in a sign China is eager to keep up the positive momentum in cross-Pacific ties.
However, the father of leading dissident Wang Dan said on Friday that China's 1996 jailing of his son, a former leader of the 1989 student-led demonstrations for more democracy, was clear evidence of the kind of abuse the U.S. report condemns.
All nations had the right and responsibility to concern themselves with human rights in other countries, said Wang Xianzeng, whose 27-year-old son was last year sentenced to 11 years in prison for plotting to overthrow the government.
The recent Sino-U.S. rapprochement has survived Wang Dan's last October jailing after a four-hour trial that was denounced by human rights activists as a politically orchestrated sham.
New Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who is to visit China next month, has said she will pursue a policy of inclusion rather than isolation towards China and, while keen to foster human rights, does not want to hold the overall relationship hostage to one issue.

3735,"If every person in Russia and Germany turned on their televisions, that would equal the number of Chinese who have watched a primetime documentary on the life of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.
""There is a rather high viewership,"" said one official of China Central Television (CCTV) when asked how many of China's 1.2 billion people were watching the 12-part documentary launched with much fanfare on New Year's Day.
He estimated the ratings at 28 percent of the estimated 800 million Chinese who have access to a television -- or 224 million people sitting in front of their screens every evening at 8.00 p.m. (1200 GMT) for the past 12 days.
That compares with about 40 million who watch the nightly evening news -- a stultifying menu of Communist Party leaders meeting visiting heads of state or issuing political pronouncements and images of factory output successes.
It outstrips ratings of recent popular soap operas, although it cannot match the number who watch the spectacle of song and dance that transfixes China on Lunar New Year's Eve.
Deng Xiaoping has faced scant competition from other channels for the eyes of China's television audience.
Usual primetime viewing offers a choice between game shows, soap operas imbued with socialist propaganda or saccharine love stories imported from Singapore or Hong Kong.
The decision to run the series, after four years of shooting and post-production, followed a surprise, last-minute edict from China's propaganda tsars, CCTV officials said.
Officials were unable to explain why it was necessary to wait until early December to schedule broadcast of a documentary that had been in the works for so long.
Political analysts said the paean was aimed at stressing the importance of Deng in the year when Hong Kong will return to Beijing sovereignty under an accord he brokered, but when poor health will prevent him from attending the ceremony.
Speculation abounds of Deng's fragility, ranging from rumours of his sudden admission to hospital in recent days to reports that he remains at home with little change in his health but no longer mentally alert.
Deng has not been seen in public for nearly three years -- a result of his own desire to retire from the front of stage to a behind-the-scenes role, as well as his failing health, analysts say. In his last appearance he looked weak and faltering.
CCTV's advertising department had long ago sold all space for advertisements to accompany a soap opera due to be shown in early January at the usual rates of about 70,000 yuan ($8,400) per 15 seconds when the sudden reprogramming order arrived.
It was regarded as inappropriate to interrupt with advertising each 45-minute episode on the man whose pragmatic market policies turned a backward Stalinist state into an economic powerhouse.
As a result, viewers have been regaled with a breathless commentary on the achievements of China's architect of reform sandwiched between 15 minutes of advertisements ranging from sanitary napkins, instant noodles and soap to pumpkin seeds, insurance, toothpaste and shampoo.
CCTV's advertising department said it had not received any complaints from customers expecting to sell their karaoke machines or chocolate during a soap opera and instead found their products linked to a tribute to China's political boss.

3742,"Deng Xiaoping's most daring attempt at reform of China was also among his most dismal failures -- politics.
It was an omission that will haunt his successors.
His anointed heir, Communist Party chief and state President Jiang Zemin, will also almost certainly inherit a power struggle in a country where political structures have yet to fully enshrine the handover of power.
Deng, who died late on Wednesday aged 92, had raised the prospect of democracy, ensuring tens of millions of peasants have the right to elect local representatives.
But he failed to build a structure that would solve the centuries-old problem of how an emperor could hand down power after he passed from the scene.
Deng regarded political reform, complemented by economic invigoration, as crucial to the survival of Communist Party rule.
""In essence the purpose of political restructuring is to overcome bureaucratism, develop socialist democracy and stimulate the initiative of the people and of the grass-roots units,"" Deng told a Japanese visitor in September 1986.
The main aims he emphasised after he gained power in late 1978 were separation of party and government roles, rejuvenation of the leadership and re-establishment of party democracy.
""For Deng, democracy is a way of making the communist party state more efficient,"" wrote David Goodman in ""Deng Xiaoping.""
He never envisaged a system of universal suffrage and was therefore forced to crush those who went too far by demanding Western-style democracy and finally to settle for superficial reform that would not allow any threat to party supremacy.
His combination of rapid economic reform alongside gradual political change saved China's Communist Party from the fate of its Soviet cousin -- where rapid political reform toppled a regime that did not press ahead on the economic front.
He ended up creating a system in which the party held sway as a virtual parasite to a parallel government, economic and social structure and where corruption and abuse of power flourished in the loopholes.
Deng separated functions of party and government to stop the party interfering to replace government, to prevent over-concentration of authority in party and in individual hands and to end absence of responsibility in the bureaucracy.
The party should guide, not govern, in Deng's view.
By the time of his death, the government was responsible for administration, it was the executor of decisions on policy that were the prerogative of the party.
Deng pulled no punches in injecting new blood into a party leadership riddled with ageing veterans after the upheaval of the 1966-76 radical Cultural Revolution.
He battled stiff opposition to shunt elders into a temporary holding pen -- the Central Advisory Commission, which he was finally able to retire in 1993.
To try to ensure an orderly succession, he set an example by stepping down from a string of public offices, abandoning all his positions by the end of 1989.
But he was forced to appoint and then sack two heirs apparent.
His third choice, Jiang Zemin -- also chosen by Deng personally to head the party -- survived until Deng's death, but with no orderly succession pattern yet in place to prevent the usually brutal and often bloody succession struggles that have followed the deaths of Chinese emperors for centuries.
Encouragement of party-led democracy -- emphasis on the need to stimulate individual and group initiative -- was the third plank in his political reform programme.
""In the final analysis, all our other reforms depend on the success of political reforms, because it is human beings who will -- or will not -- carry them out,"" Deng said in 1986.
""Without political reform, economic reform cannot succeed because the first obstacle to overcome is people's resistance.""
Deng drew the line when the enthusiasm of the people for political reform became too extreme with open calls for democracy, and he sent the army to kill unarmed students who urged greater openness in the spring of 1989.
He did allow limited democracy, with villages all over China empowered to elect district leaders from a pool of more than one candidate but free speech and publication of ideas and assembly were going too far.
Those limits may influence a final judgment on his standing in Chinese history.
""In the annals of history there is only a small chapter devoted to those who advanced economic progress,"" wrote Lucian W. Pye in ""Deng Xiaoping: Portrait of a Chinese Statesman"".
""The big chapters are reserved for those leaders who brought political freedom and security to their people.""

3747,"China on Thursday began six days of mourning for paramount leader Deng Xiaoping after an 18-year rule that transformed China from backward Stalinist state to economic powerhouse. He was 92.
A letter from the ruling Communist Party, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission to China's 1.2 billion people expressed profound grief at the death of ""a great Marxist, a great proletarian revolutionary, statesman, military strategist and diplomat"".
China's Foreign Ministry announced six days of mourning, indicating Deng's funeral could take place on February 25.
The gravel-voiced veteran of military battlefields and backroom political struggles died at 9.08 p.m. (1308 GMT) on Wednesday in Beijing, the official Xinhua news agency said.
Deng, whose pragmatic market reforms propelled China onto the world stage as an emerging economic superpower, was in the advanced stages of Parkinson's disease. He died of respiratory failure after he did not respond to emergency treatment.
Chinese sources close to the party said doctors performed an emergency tracheotomy to try to save Deng, reportedly in the crimson-walled Zhongnanhai government compound just off Tiananmen Square.
The party and government ""proclaim with profound grief to the whole party, the whole army and the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country that our beloved Comrade Deng Xiaoping... passed away"", Xinhua said.
His career spanned much of the 20th century, from the last emperor to the birth of China as a nuclear power. He swept to power in 1978 after being purged three times and retired only in 1990.
He led China from Mao Zedong's ultra-leftist fervour to a nation at its most stable and prosperous for nearly 200 years, and his influence reigned supreme until his death.
He died without achieving one of his dreams -- to be present in Hong Kong when the colony, wrested from China at gunpoint by the British as spoils of victory in the opium wars, returns to Beijing's sovereignty at midnight on June 30 this year.
No foreign dignitaries would be invited to the funeral, Chjina said.
Flags were flying at half-mast in Tiananmen Square and at the Great Hall of the People, as well at Chinese embassies around the world ""to express the incomparable esteem and profound grief of the whole Party, the whole army and the people"".
Condolences poured in for Deng, who had not been seen in public since the Chinese lunar new year festival in 1994 when he appeared frail and faltering on a visit to Shanghai.
U.S. President Bill Clinton said he was saddened to learn of Deng's death, calling him an ""extraordinary figure on the world stage over the past two decades"".
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said he was saddened and pledged to ""continue to work with China's leaders for the long-term stability of our bilateral relationship"".
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien voiced regret but said his feelings were mixed due to Deng's record on human rights.
Deng died almost within sight of Tiananmen Square, where troops and tanks of the People's Liberation Army, acting on Deng's orders, crushed student-led demonstrations for more democracy with heavy loss of life in 1989.
Diplomats said immediate factional struggle was unlikely in the China's internecine political world, because Deng's anointed heir, party chief Jiang Zemin had a firm grip on power.
Factory manager and technocrat Jiang has already amassed the positions of party chief, state President and head of the armed forces. But Jiang is 70, and will soon have to confront his own succession dilemma.
An official obituary on Deng from Xinhua urged China's 1.2 billion people to rally behind his heir.
Chinese responded with shock and sadness to news of Deng's demise, but without the great outpouring of grief that greeted Mao's death in 1976.
""Then we cried like we lost our father and mother,"" said one driver parked near Deng's central Beijing residence. ""Now everyone is indifferent.""
Streets were quiet and calm on Thursday, although extra police patrolled outside Zhongnanhai and military cars with flashing lights drove along main city streets.
Police stood guard around the compound in central Beijing where Deng lived, turning away mourners bringing wreaths.
Stock markets in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan were highly volatile on Thursday, contrary to forecasts by market pundits who expected a moderate response to Deng's death.
Reaction in U.S. markets had been muted and many other Asian markets also showed little if any response to the news, focusing instead on domestic considerations.
The People's Daily newspaper splashed a black-and-white portrait of a smiling Deng over much of its front page and all newspapers ran a black masthead.
""Comrade Deng Xiaoping was an outstanding leader enjoying high prestige acknowledged by the Party, the army and the people of all ethnic groups throughout China,"" Xinhua's lengthy obituary said.
It called Deng ""a long-tested communist fighter, the chief architect of China's socialist reforms, opening up and modernisation drive, and the founder of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics"".

The story of an ageing bachelor's re-awakening when he takes an abandoned Russian boy under his wing on the eve of Prague's bloodless 1989 Velvet Revolution won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film in the ceremony held late on Monday.
President Vaclav Havel, a former dissident playwright under communism who acted in a few films himself, sent a victory telegram to the family Sverak in Los Angeles.
""I am pleased with the great success of your film. I am happy that after many years a Czech film has again received the Oscar,"" Havel's press office quoted the telegram as saying.
Local newscasts headlined the Kolya win for the director Jan, 31, and his scriptwriter father Zdenek, who played the greybeard bachelor in Kolya.
""The Oscar Goes to Prague"" heralded the capital city's daily Vecernik Praha.
It was the first Czech foreign language film Oscar since Jiri Menzel's ""Closely Observed Trains"" won in 1968 amid the period known worldwide as the ""Czech New Wave"".
Slovak Elmar Klos won the best foreign film Oscar in 1966 for ""The Shop on Main Street"" when Czechoslovakia was still ruled as one state.
This country of 10 million people also lays claim to director Milos Forman, a Prague native who made the Oscar-winning ""Amadeus"" (1985) and ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (1976) after emigrating to the United States.
Forman failed to pick up best director honours on Monday after his nomination for ""The People Versus Larry Flint"", after winning a Golden Globe and the Berlin's Golden Bear for the film.
The Sverak team made their first international splash in 1992, when the post-war drama-comedy ""Elementary School"" earned a first Oscar nomination but lost.
Zdenek is currently working on the team's first original English-language script.
Critics say Kolya, a politically-charged comedy/drama which draws heavily on the decades of animosity -- and jokes -- Czechs had for occupying Russian forces, may be one of the region's best offerings since the Czech New Wave.
""The film is about how the understanding between nations is much more important than the power,"" Sverak told reporters backstage after winning the Oscar.
Earlier this month Kolya won the Czech version of the Oscar, the Czech Lev (Lion), for best picture, but Zdenek Sverak was edged out for the best Czech actor award by Bolek Polivka, a popular cabaret comedian.
Kolya was favoured to take home the Oscar after winning Hollywood's Golden Globe for best foreign language film in January.

3755,"Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec on Monday said his country viewed as frivolous and ""absolutely unacceptable"" Russian hints of economic reprisals for Prague's entry into NATO.
""We consider it frivolous to connect the expansion of the North Atlantic alliance with bilateral (Czech-Russian) relations and threaten economic sanctions in this context,"" the Czech news agency CTK quoted Zieleniec as saying.
Moscow's ambassador to Prague, Nikolai Ryabov, warned the Czech Republic on Sunday that key bilateral agreements with Russia might be jeopardised if it joined NATO.
Ryabov told Russia's NTV commercial television that the former Warsaw Pact member's entry into the Western defence alliance could mean a damaging loss of arms markets for Moscow.
The ambassador went on to hint that Moscow could reconsider economic deals with Prague if it went ahead.
""Agreements fundamental to the Czech Republic, such as gas deliveries and nuclear energy, create a basis for future problems that our countries would face,"" he said.
Zieleniec told CTK that Ryabov's statement made it clear why the Czechs wanted to join Western organisations.
""This type of demand is one of the reasons why it is important...at the earliest, to become a member of the key Western political, economic, and security organisations,"" Zieleniec said.
He said he thought the ambassador's interview on Russian television was mostly for media consumption.
The Czechs, Poland and Hungary are expected to be named among the first former-Soviet Bloc countries to be invited to join NATO at a July summit of the alliance in Madrid.
After the collapse of former communist trade arrangements in the early part of the decade, total Czech trade turnover with Russia grew 9.8 percent in 1996 to $2.8 billion.
But it was heavily weighted in Russia's favour with Czech exports to Russia at $694 million while imports from Russia were $2.1 billion.
Czechs are still dependent on Russia for natural gas and most of their crude oil, but Prague is in the final stages of negotiations of a long-term contract for some of its gas supplies to come from Norway.
Last year, the Czechs opened the Ingolstadt spur in the Transalpine crude pipeline from the Adriatic Sea, providing direct access to crude from the Middle East.
The Czech power company CEZ a.s. is also dependent on Russian nuclear fuel for its lone atomic power station at Dukovany. But the company is expected to take U.S.-supplied nuclear fuel when it opens a new plant at Temelin by the end of the century.
The Czech army is also considering several offers to modernise its mostly Soviet-era equipment with Western-made, NATO-compatible goods.

3756,"A Czech appeals court rejected on Tuesday a move by a group of minority shareholders to invalidate a $1.32 billion 1995 tender which gave a 27 percent stake in fixed-line monopoly SPT Telecom a.s. to a Dutch-Swiss consortium, SPT said.
The decision, which overturns a lower court ruling, means the Telsource consortium, combining PTT Netherlands and Swiss Telecom, will remain SPT's largest shareholder after the Czech government, which still holds a majority stake.
The lawsuit concerned the validity of a decision at an SPT general meeting held in February 1995, setting up the tender which at the time was the largest privatisation in post-Communist Europe.
The action was brought by a group of Czech investors who contended former Economics Minister Karel Dyba did not have authority to represent the state in voting at a general meeting which approved the plan for SPT to take on a strategic partner.
A second suit over another general meeting in August 1995 is still under review, but the decision on Tuesday is a setback for the group which has been agressively challenging the tender.
The Dutch-Swiss consortium bid $1.32 billion in cash, and another $131 million in services, to win the tender over four other international telecom groups, promising to double the country's network to more than four million lines by the end of the century.
SPT said after the decision that the ruling on Tuesday would help its creditibility with investors, after large finance programmes were held up because of the lawsuits. ""The decision only confirms the integrity of the current view of our company and thus all resolutions of the SPT general meeting are valid,"" SPT's chairman Lubos Rezabek said in a statement.
A second lawsuit, brought by the same group led by Czech businessman Martin Mosinger, concerns the conduct of a general meeting in August 1995 where the transaction won final approval.
""I believe that the second suit... will soon be concluded to our benefit and it will put an end to questions regarding the SPT privatisation,"" Rezabek said.
SPT last April mandated U.S.-based banks Chase Manhattan and Citibank to arrange a $500 million, five-year syndicated loan to part finance the firm's long-term development programme.
The syndicated loan was delayed pending decisions on the lawsuits.
SPT shares closed 13 crowns lower on the Prague Stock Exchange on Tuesday at 4,040 ahead of the news.

3759,"The Czech government, central Europe's perennial budget hawk, says it will consider a plan next week to cut all ministries' spending in order to balance the 1996 budget by year's end.
The Finance Ministry is proposing cuts of roughly more than one percent from the 1996 budgets of every ministry, because of a projected 6.6 billion crown ($248 million) revenue shortfall and a 2.7 billion over-expenditure from the originally approved balanced budget.
""The total we need to cut is roughly 9.3 billion crowns,"" Deputy Finance Minister Miroslav Havel told Reuters.
Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus's government has been widely praised by financial analysts for passing four consecutive balanced budgets, earning him the reputation as post-Communist Europe's tightest fiscal manager.
Earlier, Klaus told a news conference after a cabinet meeting that the finance ministry plan would be on the agenda of next week's government session.
Deputy minister Havel said the cuts, would not affect pensions or civil service wages, but would be broad, not deep.
""(The cuts) will touch every ministry and in the same level -- the same percentage of reduction of several non-investment outlays. Certainly we're not cutting pensions or wages,"" said Havel, who directs budget planning for the ministry.
""But we are reducing such expenditures on materials and other things,"" he added.
Analysts said the Czech capital markets would welcome the move as it would keep billions of crown out of the bloated money supply which has already been fueling inflationary domestic demand.
""I would consider this to be a very positive move,"" said Jan Vlachy, vice-chariman at Prague's Patria Finance. ""This is basically the only way I could have imagined the government could have had an (immediate) impact on inflation.""
Domestic bond prices have been depressed of late after central bank moves to tighten the money supply in late June signalled inflation worries were strong.
Annual inflation has remained stubbornly around nine percent this year, above the eight percent the government projected by the year's end.
The budget cuts, if passed, would reduce the entire 1996 state budget to 291 billion crowns from the plan passed by parliament last December.
Havel said the revenue gap was mostly due to Russia's failure to pay about five billion crowns on loans owed to the Czech Republic.
The largest component of the over-expenditure was subsidies for heating because of the longer than expected cold weather and other social aid payments, he said.
""You know (the ministers) don't like cutting their budgets. But we're doing it because of the total macroeconomic situation,"" Havel said. ($1=26.63 Czech Crown)

3779,"The Czech National Bank (CNB) on Tuesday put the largest fully-private bank, Agrobanka a.s., under forced administration due to liquidity problems arising from the failure of another bank, Kreditni Banka a.s..
The central bank, in its 12th intervention into a commercial bank in the post-Communist period, said it would guarantee all of Agrobanka's obligations during a ""temporary"" forced administration period of an unspecified duration.
Analysts said the move was another badly-needed step in reforming the banking sector and should speed up overall market reforms.
CNB Governor Josef Tosovsky on Tuesday said that the central bank instructed the ""big banks"" to prepare up to six billion crowns ($159 million) to help liqidity at Agrobanka, which has four billion crowns in basic capital.
Tosovsky did not elaborate on what form the liquidity help might take or from which source.
The ""Big Four"" banks are Ceska Sporitelna, Komercni Banka, Investicni a Postovni Banka and Ceskoslovensko Obchodni Banka a.s. (CSOB) -- all in which the state holds a significant stake. All but CSOB, have privately-held shares.
Tosovsky, who called Agrobanka's situation a problem with ""liquidity not solvency"" said the central bank would jump in with its own funds if necessary to help the central bank's ""precautionary measures"".
In a statement issued after an overnight meeting of the Czech cabinet, the CNB said that problems of Agrobanka, the country's fifth largest overall, had arisen as a consequence of the failure of the medium-sized Kreditni Banka a.s.
It also said the move stemmed from the investigation of people in the Kreditni case -- in which five people connected to Kreditni have been indicted on fraud charges -- who are also connected to Agrobanka.
""The investigation of the fall of Kreditni Banka...and its politicisation, and charges against people connected to Agrobanka, negatively influences the liquidity position of this bank (Agrobanka),"" the CNB said in its statement.
Over 70 percent of banking activity in the country is done within the four largest banks.
In order to support Agrobanka, the CNB said it would guarantee all deposits at the bank, and that it would ensure, in cooperation with other commercial banks, sufficient ""financial sources"" for Agrobanka, should it need them.
Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said the central bank's move was a preventative step aimed at keeping the banking sector sound. ""There isn't even the slightest reason for any sort of banking panic,"" Klaus told journalists on Tuesday.

3783,"The right-wing Czech coalition government ended nine uneasy months of ruling with a parliamentary minority on Tuesday when a former opposition deputy crossed the aisle to bring it a key seat.
Tomas Teplik, recently expelled from the opposition Social Democratic Party (CSSD), joined Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus's Civic Democratic Party (ODS), an official in the ODS's parliament office told Reuters.
The switch gives the ruling coalition 100 seats in the 200-seat lower house of parliament, after having a minority since general elections last June.
""I can confirm that the (ODS parliamentary) caucus voted to accept Teplik,"" said Vlasta Kloncarova of the ODS.
Financial analysts welcomed the news which they said would increase confidence in the Czech economy. ""I would call it a higher level of comfort,"" said Jan Pudil, director of the Prague-based investment house WoodCommerz.
""This is going to take away the political questions... and keep investors focusing on the fundamentals in the macro-economy, which is the way it should be,"" he added.
Klaus's coalition, which has held power longer than any conservative government in post-Communist Europe, lost its large majority in parliament last June after a surprisingly strong second place showing by the centre-left Social Democrats.
Though divided on some issues, the coalition has remained united in all key votes.
Another former CSSD member, budget committee chairman Josef Wagner, declared himself an independent last weekend after the Social Democrats expelled him for voting with the ruling coalition last December on the 1997 budget.
The CSSD expelled Teplik -- who also voted with the government on the budget -- along with Wagner late last year, but unlike Wagner, Teplik did not try to rejoin the CSSD.
Wagner's membership was officially terminated by the CSSD's national congress earlier this month, and he has said he will remain ""an independent Social Democrat.""
He has said he will not necessarily vote with the government to give the coalition an absolute majority.
Marie Noveska, who was elected as a CSSD deputy last June but resigned from the party after it was revealed that she had falsely used a ""Doctor of Law"" title, has remained in parliament as an independent.

3784,"The Czech cabinet will adopt a carrot-and-stick package mixing investment incentives with budget and import cuts in an attempt to spur economic growth, a Reuters poll of analysts showed on Tuesday.
With the cabinet due to announce its ""package"" of stimulus measures on Wednesday, share market repairs and savings promotion steps to reduce demand were most frequently mentioned by the nine analysts as likely to be included.
The government said it aims to reduce growing budget and trade deficits, while spurring growth, dampening demand for imports and adding confidence to beleaguered capital markets.
None of the analysts expected a direct manipulation of the exchange rate to help exports, although several suggested allowing the crown to ease below its corridor of plus/minus 7.5 percent from the mid-point of a mark/dollar basket.
Josef Poeschl at the Vienna Institute for Comparative Economic Studies, said lower interest rates were needed, but Merrill Lynch's Andrew Kenningham expects lower rates would be put off until more data on slowing growth is available.
There was a consensus among the analysts that the cabinet should take steps to beef up market regulation with most saying a U.S.-style Securities and Exchange Commission would help bring back lagging foreign invesmtent.
The analysts agreed sharp budget cuts were on the cards, as economic growth, and thus tax revenue, has come up short.
Expectations ranged from 20 billion crowns in cuts seen as ""very likely"" by Boris Gomez and Susanne Hallergard at ING Barings, to 40-50 billion forecast by Kenningham.
""At least 25 billion crowns of cuts are needed to give good chance of a balanced budget,"" said Kennigham. ""Anything short of a balanced budget lacks credibility.""
There was a broad consensus that state sector wages would be capped at 10 percent nominal growth -- Kenningham said that should save about 30 billion crowns this year -- and several expect pressure on the private sector to follow suit.
Kamil Janacek, chief economist at Komercni Banka, said the government should seek a budget surplus of two to three percent of GDP, but more likely would move toward just a balance.
Janacek, who works at the largest state-controlled bank, said the government must finish privatising big banks and industrial corporations.
He said he expects the issuing of longer-term government bonds ""to increase the propensity to save in the household sector"" and for ""changes in legal and institutional framework enabling better functioning of the legal infrastructure"".
Several said they expected longer-term state bonds to be issued aimed at attracting individual Czech retail investors to park their money for awhile, reducing demand.
The group was mixed on the need to impose surcharges or quotas to reduce demand for imports which have thrown the current account deficit to more than 8.5 percent of GDP.
Gomez and Hallergard said they expected ""seasonal"" import duties ""on selected foodstuffs and more stringent non-tariff trade barriers on imports, particulary from EU"" in the package.
Poeschl said he expected some non-tariff barriers will be introduced on selected items and should be for a defined period of time, including plans for a gradual removal.
Other key comments included:
* Martin Kupka at Prague's Patria Finance said he expected ""considerable"" budget cuts, anti-import administrative measures and a rise in consumption taxes to dampen demand.
* Matt Starr, bond trader at Creditanstalt Prague, said he expected a cap on wages, budget cuts, a move to separate invesment funds from banks -- an often-repeated problem in the capital markets -- and more support for the Export Guarantee and Insurance agency (EGAP) and state export bank.

3785,"The outgoing vice-chairman of Czech Skoda Auto a.s., a unit of Volkswagen AG , rejected as ""nonsense"" on Wednesday a German magazine report connecting him to a VW bribery affair under investigation.
Volkhard Koehler was unexpectedly replaced on Skoda's board last week, and a subsequent story in the weekly Der Spiegel said it was because he had prevented an investigation into a bribery affair linked to VW employees and was involved in dubious real estate transactions.
A Skoda spokesman, Milan Smutny, said in a statement on Wednesday that Koehler had spoken to economic corruption investigators in the German city of Braunschweig who confirmed that he was not the subject of any investigation.
""The state prosecution office confirmed that (Koehler) is not the target of any investigation,"" Smutny said. He quoted Koehler as saying Der Spiegel's claims were ""absolutely nonsense"".
VW chairman Ferdinand Piech said last week that corruption allegations, which centred on a plant expansion contract for Skoda awarded to Swiss-Swedish engineering group ABB , involved ""a nearly double-digit sum in the millions of marks"".
He said a probe into allegations that VW employees have demanded and received bribes in return for contracts, had so far turned up only one employee who has since been suspended.
The employee was not named.
Piech said the figures involved are well below German media reports that have said the contract was worth some 400 million marks and included bribes of about 20 million marks.
VW said its purchasing division in the summer of 1994 approved a 74 million mark contract for a Skoda paint factory and a second contract worth 38 million marks to expand the facility.
Smutny said that all decisions on purchases over 100,000 marks at Skoda had to be approved by officials at Volkswagen headquarters in Germany.
German prosecutors in Braunschweig have said they were investigating two suspects as part of their probe at VW, brought about by the carmaker in a formal legal request.
Smutny said Koehler was expecting another assignment from VW headquarters in Wolfsburg after his stint with Skoda ends on April 15. He said that the non-renewal of his contract conformed to standard Volkswagen practice.
The functions of Skoda board members named last week will be announced in a news conference on April 3, Smutny said.

3790,"Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P) on Tuesday gave investment grade ratings to three of the four largest Czech banks, but said the high marks were partly due to an implied safety net for the banks provided by the state.
In its first quality debt ratings for commercial banks in former communist Europe, S&amp;P gave long-term ratings of BBB-minus to Komercni Banka a.s., Ceska Sporitelna a.s. , and  Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka a.s..
It also issued all three banks short-term ratings of A3 for counterparty risk in trade with other banks.
The ratings fell short of the Czech Republic's sovereign rating of A, but were similar to the marks issued to the Slovak, Polish, and Greek central banks, and one grade above Hungarian sovereign debt.
But in explaining the ratings, S&amp;P said the three banks' size and position in the market made it ""highly likely that the Czech government would provide support"" if needed.
Thus, the ratings were higher than they would have been if based solely on each bank's financial situation.
S&amp;P did not give a rating for the third largest Czech bank, IPB a.s., which is waiting for a roughly one-third stake to be privatised in a tender later this spring.
S&amp;P said Komercni had 25 percent of Czech deposits, 26 percent of the credit market and conducted 10 percent of total trading on the Prague Stock Exchange last year.
""Given the bank's size, its importance to the country's financial system, and position in the market, S&amp;P believes state support would be forthcoming if required in the future, although no formal guarantee exists,"" it said of Komercni, the country's largest commercial bank.
It said that Komercni's classified loans totalled 35.4 percent at the end of September and its outlook was stable.
Komercni's deputy general director Borivoj Prazak told reporters after the announcement that the bank was ""very glad"" to receive the ratings. ""We held our ground,"" despite slower than expected Czech macroeconomic growth, he said.
As with the other two banks, the Czech government has a major stake in Komcerni, 48.7 percent.
The government has said it plans to privatise all state-held banks, so getting the ratings based on the tacit state safety net adds more intrigue to the debate over the speed and extent of Czech banking privatisation.
S&amp;P noted that Sporitelna, the former Communist savings bank where virtually all deposits were kept, was still ""the most important player in Czech retail banking"" but said it ""remains vulnerable to further problems within the sector"".
""(Sporitelna's) asset quality problems remain a concern with customer loans classified as non-standard amounting to 43.6 billion crowns ($1.58 billion), representing 31.8 percent of gross customer loans at year-end 1995,"" S&amp;P said.
It said that CSOB's ratings reflected the bank's strong position in foreign trade financing and its joint ownership by the Czech and Slovak governments.
The S&amp;P report said CSOB's non-standard loan level had dropped to 41 percent of gross customer loans by the end of 1995 from 51 percent at the end of the previous year.

The story of an ageing bachelor's reawakening when he takes an abandoned Russian boy under his wing on the eve of Prague's bloodless 1989 Velvet Revolution won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film in the ceremony late on Monday.
President Vaclav Havel, a former dissident playwright under communism who acted in films himself, sent a victory telegram to the Sveraks in Los Angeles.
""I am pleased with the great success of your film. I am happy that after many years a Czech film has again received the Oscar,"" Havel's press office quoted the telegram as saying.
Czech media also applauded for the win for the director Jan, 31, and his scriptwriter father Zdenek, who played the bachelor in Kolya.
""The Oscar Goes to Prague"" shouted the capital's daily Vecernik Praha.
It was the first Czech foreign language film Oscar since Jiri Menzel's won in 1968 with ""Closely Observed Trains"" one of a spate of admired movies known worldwide as the ""Czech New Wave"".
Elmar Klos from Slovakia -- now independent, but then part of Czechoslovakia -- won the best foreign film Oscar in 1966 for ""The Shop On Main Street"".
The Czech Republic, with a population of 10 million, also lays claim to director Milos Forman, a Prague native who made the Oscar-winning ""Amadeus"" in 1985 and ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" in 1976 after emigrating to the United States.
Forman failed to pick up best director honours on Monday after his nomination for ""The People Versus Larry Flint"", after winning a Golden Globe and the Berlin's Golden Bear for the film.
The Sverak team made their first international splash in 1992, when the post-war drama-comedy ""Elementary School"" earned a first Oscar nomination but lost. Zdenek is currently working on the team's first original English-language script.
Critics say Kolya, a politically-charged comedy-drama which draws heavily on the decades of animosity -- and jokes -- Czechs had for occupying Russian forces, may be one of the region's best offerings since the Czech New Wave.
""The film is about how the understanding between nations is much more important than the power,"" Sverak told reporters backstage after winning the Oscar.
Earlier this month Kolya won the Czech version of the Oscar, the Czech Lev (Lion), for best picture, but Zdenek Sverak was edged out for the best Czech actor award by Bolek Polivka, a popular cabaret comedian.
Kolya was favoured to take home the Oscar after winning Hollywood's Golden Globe for best foreign language film in January.

3798,"Pop star Michael Jackson launched his first concert tour in three years on Saturday with a high-tech spectacle in Prague aimed at restoring a career tarnished by allegations of child molestation.
Jackson exploded through the floor of his futuristic stage and emerged in gold-plated astronaut's armour to open the concert with one of his latest hits, ""Scream"".
On a stage blending a classical Greek temple with a space station, Jackson matched the high tech wizardry with his formidable dancing skills, singing many of the hits of his 20-year career.
The three-month ""HIStory World Tour"" will take hundreds of tonnes of equipment to stops in Europe, Africa, Asia, but with no dates scheduled for the Americas.
Many of the estimated 120,000 spectators on Prague's sprawling Letna Plain -- where Communist leaders once reviewed military parades -- stood awestruck as massive ""Jumbotron"" video screens dominated Jackson's virtual-reality show.
""It's more of a video game than a concert,"" said one Prague student as she stood in the crowd mid-way from where the real Jackson looked like a blip on a radar screen.
Fans from Malta to Moscow made the trip to Prague, but the biggest of the 40,000-strong foreign contingent came from neighbouring Germany where Jackson had cancelled planned stops because of high taxes charged to visiting entertainers.
Some 130,000 people were expected for the two-hour concert in Prague, but ticket touts outside the gates were offering $30 tickets for less than $10.
Czech President Vaclav Havel -- dubbed ""Rock'n Roll President"" as a fan of the Rolling Stones, Velvet Undergound and Frank Zappa, who have all played in Prague -- showed up although he said Jackson's music ""isn't close"" to him.
The first part of the tour has a heavy Eastern European flavour with stops planned for Hungary, Romania, Poland, and Russia, matching a theme running through the ""HIStory"" album which includes the song ""Stranger in Moscow"".
The first tour of the self-proclaimed ""King of Pop"" since 1993's ""Dangerous"" tour is to back ""HIStory,"" which has lagged well behind his 1982 album ""Thriller"", the all-time top seller with 44 million copies sold worldwide.
But the tour marks the biggest effort yet to get Jackson's career back on track after a long-running scandal over child-sex abuse allegations.
The charges first came to light in August 1993, when a 13-year-old boy accused Jackson of molesting him.
Jackson denied wrongdoing but reached a multimillion-dollar settlement with the boy, and prosecutors dropped their investigation in 1994 after the child refused to testify.
The concert marks the climax of five of the most bizarre days in the history of the ancient Czech capital, as the star's game of hide-and-seek kept a horde of fans and media guessing outside his hotel, and clogged streets in the city's centre.
Reports that Jackson was furious with a local tabloid's rehash of the child molestation story led local media to speculate that he might cancel Saturday's concert as he remained holed-up in his hotel suite for much of the week.
On Friday, Jackson sparked a near-riot when he ventured out to visit St Vitus Cathedral in Prague Castle, and fans climbed over pews in the holy Bohemian shrine to get close.
Meanwhile, concert organisers erected a giant water-filled statue of Jackson on the same hill over Prague where a massive monument to Soviet-leader Josef Stalin once stood.  REUTER

3801,"A surprisingly weak February jobs report for Canada on Friday is staining the Liberal government's economic record as Canadians gear up for a federal election this year.
Canada's unemployment rate in February was stuck at 9.7 percent for the third month in a row, the government agency, Statistics Canada said. The figure was sharply higher than the U.S. jobless rate of 5.3 percent reported on Friday.
Especially dismal was the loss of 18,700 Canadian jobs last month. Full-time employment dropped by 38,000 from January, while part-time employment grew by 19,300.
Women and young people bore the brunt of the job losses, with women losing 44,000 full-time jobs and youths aged 15 to 24 losing 22,000 jobs.
The jobless news came with a federal election on the horizon, perhaps as soon as June.
The government of Prime Minister Jean Chretien has a commanding lead in public opinion polls and has won international praise for slashing Canada's budget deficit.
But it faces growing criticism over unemployment, the one serious blot on the economic landscape.    ""Despite what the
polls suggest, they (the Liberals) may be in trouble,"" said economics professor Fred Lazar at York University in Toronto. ""There's an increasing resentment building in the electorate.""
""These figures are a damning indictment of a government with no clue, no plan and no idea how real jobs are created,"" said Monte Solberg, finance critic for the opposition Reform Party.
Some opposition politicians, labor groups and even left-leaning Liberals want the government to spend more on job creation. The right-wing Reform Party sees broad tax cuts as the best route to job creation.
The Liberals gamely defended their job creation record on Friday, with Finance Minister Paul Martin's parliamentary assistant Barry Campbell saying the Canadian government still expected 300,000 to 350,000 new jobs this year.
""All the other indicators are very positive,"" added Prime Minister Chretien's spokesman Peter Donolo. ""You can't deny the fact that there's been a net creation of 715,000 jobs since we took office (in late 1993), which is higher than Germany, France and Italy combined.""
Critics noted, however, that Canada's recent job creation has lagged far behind that of the United States, which has generated almost 600,000 new jobs so far this year.

3802,"Canada's French-speaking political leaders voiced anger on Friday about a new pre-election ad that suggested Quebec-born politicians did not have what it takes to keep Quebec from leaving Canada.
""The suggestion that where you are born should determine whether or not you should be prime minister of the country is to say the least offensive,"" a sombre Jean Charest, leader of the Conservative Party, told reporters in Ottawa.
The ad, promoting the right-wing Reform Party, shows three French-speaking Canadian party leaders -- including Canadian Prime Minister and Liberal leader Jean Chretien -- along with Quebec Premier and leading separatist Lucien Bouchard.
As the ad calls for ""a voice for all Canadians, not just Quebec politicians,"" the images of the four Quebeckers are circled in red and then each face is crossed out.
Canada has had Quebec prime ministers for 19 of the last 20 years -- Quebec has a crucial one-quarter of the population -- and Chretien led Canada in an October 1995 referendum that Quebec sovereigntists lost by only one point.
Three of the five political leaders contesting the June 2 election are from Quebec: Charest, Chretien and the leader of the separatist Bloc Quebecois, Gilles Duceppe.
Aside from Reform's Preston Manning, from the West, the New Democratic Party's Alexa McDonough is the only non-Quebecker to lead a major political party in this campaign.
""Mr. Manning is setting a very bad example,"" the normally upbeat Charest said, looking troubled. ""He's sending a message here that one part of the country doesn't count.""
Chretien declared in Niagara Falls: ""I want to tell Mr. Manning that people don't like his divisiveness.""
Manning, who advocates decentralization to please both Quebec and other provinces, contends the traditional parties have failed to devise a method to keep Canada together.
""The separatists do damage by what they do. The old-line federalists do damage by what they do not do, the plan that they do not have, the alternative model they do not have, the strategies they do not have for the next referendum.
""We're saying each is equally dangerous in its own way to the unity of the country.""
But Manning -- running second in the polls outside Quebec -- has no voter base in Quebec and a poll released on Friday showed the Liberals, the Conservatives and the Bloc Quebecois neck-and-neck in the vote-rich French-speaking province.
It was not clear how his strategy would play across the country, but as often before in this 36-day campaign, he managed to get other politicians talking about his issues.
""It can divide the country. What he is doing I think is an act of desperation,"" said one Liberal voter, retired engineer Bal Sandhu of from the western city of Edmonton, Alberta.
But many voters are sick of the Quebec issue coming up again and again and think Quebec manages to get a disproportionate share of Ottawa's attention.
""They get more opportunities than the rest of the country, because the government is bending over backwards to try and keep them in the confederation,"" a disenchanted Edmonton technologist, John Mushka, said in a phone interview.
Charest has been rising steadily in popularity since televised leadership debates last week which put national unity at the center of the election campaign.
He is on an intense two-day tour of Quebec to build momentum, with a keen eye on forming the official opposition. The Bloc Quebecois fills that role, giving Canada an official opposition whose goal is to break up the country.
The Reform Party, with its strong support in Western Canada, also has hopes of forming the official opposition.
The stakes are high for Charest, who is personally popular but whose party suffers from a turbulent past. The Tories fell to only two seats in the 1993 election after controlling the government for eight years. And former Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney is reviled across Canada.

3805,"Canada's political leaders, campaigning for re-election on June 2, are accusing one another of being too American in their approach to Canada's cherished but malnourished health care system.
Canada's universal medicare plan has suffered injury after injury in recent years as governments at the federal and provincial levels have taken a hatchet to health care spending in an effort to rein in galloping deficits.
While all Canada's main political parties are pledging to reinvest in health if successful on June 2, the sensitive issue has become a political game of numbers and name calling.
The ruling Liberals as well as the Conservative and Reform parties want to cut health care and are ""pushing Canada ever closer to an American-style two-tiered system,"" Alexa McDonough, leader of the left-leaning New Democrats, charged.
""Look past the rhetoric and look at the numbers,"" she said, adding that only her party would sustain federal support for medicare.
Government-funded universal health care is a sacred cow in Canada and a key way for Canadians to distinguish themselves from their powerful American neighbours. Polls show that preservation of health care is a major election concern.
But even as U.S. politicians have weighed adopting elements of Canadian health care in the past few years, Canada has moved further away from its traditional universal approach, adopting elements of the U.S. setup, the New Democrats say.
The Liberals have cut health and education spending to C$12.5 billion ($9.1 billion), down about C$6 billion ($4.4 billion) from 1993, when they first took office under Prime Minister Jean Chretien.
Critics say the cuts have shortened hospital stays, led to hospital closures and forced many Canadians to pay for their own home care -- shifting the system toward a U.S.-style one in which only the poor and the elderly receive care paid for by the government.
But the Liberals claim to have defended the principles of universal medicare by preventing doctors and hospitals from charging extra for their services and prohibiting private health care clinics.
""All Canadians should have equal access to high-quality care,"" Anne McLellan, a Liberal candidate and Cabinet minister, said on Tuesday at a news conference. ""We will never accept one system for the very wealthy and another for the rest of us.""

3807,"The story of Bre-X Minerals Ltd. ( ) and its fabulous Indonesian gold discovery deep in the jungles of Borneo has all the elements of a thriller: suspense, international intrigue, politics, legal wrangling and lots of money.
The end of the story is nowhere in sight.
Until this week, Toronto-based Barrick Gold Corp. appeared to have a deal with Bre-X sewn up. But Placer Dome Inc. in Vancouver raised the stakes and added another twist to the plot on Tuesday by announcing that it had made an offer for Bre-X that was now under consideration by the Indonesian government.
On Wednesday, another Vancouver mining concern, Teck Corp., said it hoped to make its own bid for Bre-X and its rich Busang deposit.
""Busang assures any company a leading position, with its low costs and large size,"" said gold analyst John Ing of brokerage Maison Placements in Toronto.
The Busang deposit in Kalimantan on the island of Borneo contains at least 57 million ounces of gold, worth $21 billion at today's prices. Many analysts believe the deposit could contain more than 100 million ounces of high-grade, low-cost gold.
Until this week, it seemed Barrick was the only company with a realistic chance of grabbing a share of the project.
In November, the Indonesian government told Bre-X, which discovered the Busang gold find, to form a joint venture with Barrick and present their deal to the government for approval.
A proposal was assembled last month and awaits the government's blessing.
But the Indonesian government's edict spooked the international mining community and angered many Bre-X shareholders who felt their company had been forced to negotiate with a gun to its head. Some Bre-X shareholders hired high-profile lawyers to ensure their interests were protected in any eventual deal.
Meanwhile, the Barrick-Bre-X arrangement spawned rampant rumors in the mining and investment communities, prompting observers to ask why Busang deposit was not auctioned to the highest bidder, how Barrick acquired such a privileged position and who was calling the shots in hammering out a final deal.
Barrick maintains it was chosen for its experience operating large gold mines, its environmental record and its strong financial position.
Others cite Barrick's alliance with the influential daughter of Indonesia's President Suharto, and Barrick's high-powered advisory board, which includes former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and former U.S. President George Bush.
Although Barrick contends it is still the only company in the running for Bre-X, shareholders have pushed up Bre-X's stock on the belief that Placer Dome may have a chance, analysts said.
""If it were a horse race, you'd have to look at Placer,"" said analyst Ing.
Bre-X shares rose C$1.10 to C$24.45 on Wednesday on the Toronto Stock Exchange after jumping C$1.90 to C$23.35 on Tuesday.
Analysts said Indonesian officials were probably concerned about tarnishing their reputation in the international investment community and were seeking a way to allow other companies to bid on Busang without losing face.
The fact that Placer Dome boldly declared its intentions in a news release, adding that it had discussed the matter with high-ranking Indonesian officials, could be a sign that the bidding process had already opened, said gold analyst Chad Williams at Research Capital in Montreal.
""We may be in the midst of a bidding process as we speak, a bidding process by Indonesian standards,"" Williams said. ""I think the Indonesians appreciate how important it is to attract foreign investment, so they're treading very carefully.""
For Bre-X, it is not simply a matter of waiting for word from the Indonesian government and doing what it is told.
One of Bre-X's Indonesian partners, Jusuf Merukh, this week filed a C$2 billion ($1.5 billion) lawsuit against Bre-X, its executives and others involved in Busang. The suit claims up to 40 percent of the Busang deposit. Merukh already controls an undisputed 10 percent of the smallest part of Busang.
""We're serious about this claim,"" Merukh's lawyer Aleck Trawick told Reuters by telephone from Calgary on Wednesday. He said Bre-X had 15 days to file a defense.
Bre-X described the law suit as ""frivolous"" and said it planned a vigorous defense.
Meanwhile, Bre-X is still waiting for its contract of work permits from the Indonesian government, which it needs to continue work on Busang.
Most observers agree on one thing: Indonesian  President Suharto and his close officials and advisers hold the key to any conclusion of the Bre-X saga.
""I think Placer and Barrick are waiting for some sort of signal,"" said Ing. ""I think it's a waiting game.""
While Placer Dome Chief Executive John Willson estimated this week that the saga would take three to six months to play out, some analysts believe the outcome will be clear long before that.
""I think things will develop very quickly from here on in,"" said analyst Williams.

3810,"Barrick Gold Corp said on Wednesday it was now the world's second largest gold producer, supplanting Gold Fields of South Africa Ltd.
Barrick's 1996 gold production was 3,148,801 ounces, surpassing Gold Fields' 3,125,631 ounces for fiscal 1996. Barrick expects 1997 production to top three million ounces again.
The Toronto-based company posted a 40 percent increase in its proven and probable reserves to 51 million ounces from 36.5 million ounces. Barrick also reported 25 million ounces of gold in the resource category -- gold not fully proven yet.
Barrick has made no secret of its ambition to become the world's largest gold company, surpassing Anglo American Corp of South Africa Ltd.
To clinch first place, Barrick is seeking control of the huge Busang deposit in Indonesia, said to be one of this century's most sensational gold discoveries.
Two new mines will also likely carry Barrick closer to its leadership goal. Drilling at Barrick's Pierina property in Peru expanded reserves there to 6.5 million ounces so far, Barrick said. The mine is expected to come into production in late 1999 at an annual rate of 500,000 ounces of gold.
Drilling at Barrick's Pascua mine in Chile bumped reserves to 10 million ounces so far, with 6.7 million ounces identified in the reserve category. The mine is scheduled to start production of 400,000 ounces a year by the year 2000.
Barrick has been negotiating with Calgary's Bre-X Minerals Ltd for months to control the Busang discovery, but Barrick's chances of success are up in the air.
""One of the messages they'll probably try to get across is that they are not desperate for it, they certainly don't need it, they have an awful lot already,"" said gold analyst Catherine Gignac with Deacon Capital in Toronto.
Barrick also said today that its fourth-quarter and full-year earnings fell, due mainly to higher operating and exploration costs. Fourth-quarter profit declined to US$56 million or US$0.15 a share from year earlier US$78 million or US$0.22 a share.
Full-year earnings declined to US$218 million or US$0.60 a share from US$292 million or US$0.82 a share in 1995.
Barrick was down 0.40 to 35.70 on the Toronto Stock Exchange in afternoon trading on Wednesday and by 3/8 to 26-1/2 in New York.

3811,"Canadian mining companies are keeping a wary eye on the strengthening Canadian dollar, which threatens to bruise their earnings and cash flow.
""As the Canadian dollar strengthens, it hurts us,"" said Vic Wells, spokesman for Anvil Range Mining Corp., which cited the stronger currency as a factor that forced the company to suspend zinc and lead mining at its Faro property in Canada's Yukon last December.
Analysts are forecasting a surge in the Canadian currency in 1997, with some predicting the unit to rise to 80 U.S. cents from its current 74 U.S. cent range.
""It'll take the cream off, that's for sure,"" said George Miller, president of the Mining Association of Canada.
Canada is the world's largest producer of potash, uranium and zinc, the world's second-biggest producer of nickel after Russia and an important source of copper.
Companies that produce metal mainly in Canada are especially hit by the currency strengthening against the U.S. dollar because producers must pay their operating costs in Canadian dollars. But most companies' revenues come in U.S. dollars, the currency in which most metals trade.
""Currency gets full-time attention here,"" said Alan Thomas, chief financial officer of Noranda Inc..
A change of one U.S. cent in the Canadian dollar translates into C$20 million ($14.8 million) on Noranda's bottom line, Thomas said. The currency rose about three-quarters of a U.S. cent in 1996, costing Noranda about C$15 million ($11.1 million), he said.
""So for '96, there's not a big change. But if the dollar continues to go up, it will have a bigger effect,"" he said.
""All our costs are in Canadian dollars -- the salaries we pay, the supplies we buy, the rent we pay. All our products are priced in U.S. dollars and they're priced the same regardless of the exchange rate,"" Thomas said.
Companies such as Alcan Aluminium Ltd., with most production outside Canada, are not as exposed to harm from a stronger currency since they pay most of their operating costs in U.S. dollars, analysts said.
But for companies such as Inco Ltd. and Falconbridge Ltd., which produce most of their nickel in Canada, a stronger dollar will take its toll.
Falconbridge figures a one-cent change in the Canadian dollar would knock C$7 million ($5.2 million) off its bottom line, even with the company's substantial currency hedging programme.
While Falconbridge operations in the Dominican Republic and Norway would not be affected by a stronger Canadian currency, about two-thirds of the company's operating costs originate in Canada, said Chief Financial Officer Lars-Eric Johansson.
Inco estimated that every one-cent change in the Canadian dollar amounted to a $9 million pre-tax hit despite currency hedging. But the company earned $179 million in 1996 on revenues of $3.1 billion, so small movements in the Canadian dollar do not have a huge effect, said Inco Chief Financial Officer Tony Munday.
""It's not going to kill us,"" he said.
Still, some mining analysts said the effects of a stronger Canadian dollar must be understood in context.
""With a rising dollar, it usually means metal prices are going up as well,"" said base metal analyst David Davidson with CIBC Wood Gundy in Toronto.

3812,"The glory of controlling Busang, one of the world's richest gold deposits, has thrown together an unlikely duo.
In one corner is Peter Munk, the suave but aggressive founder of heavyweight Barrick Gold Corp., backed by buckets of money, power, connections and experience.
In the other is David Walsh, the maverick chief of Bre-X Minerals Ltd., the young Canadian exploration firm that discovered Busang in the jungles of East Kalimantan on the Indonesian island of Borneo.
The Indonesian government has told Barrick and Bre-X to form a joint venture to manage the fabulous gold find. But the government edict would force an unnatural David-and-Goliath alliance on two companies led by two very different men.
To observers, Munk, 69, is the epitome of class. He makes sure everything is top-notch and pays top dollar. Barrick's imposing office towers over downtown Toronto, impressing visitors with its grandiosity.
Those who know him best say Munk plays to win. In sports, he sticks to skiing and tennis, believing that focusing on just two activities will help him excel.
With Barrick, North America's biggest gold company and Munk's baby, he sticks doggedly to gold, refusing to diversify into other metals or minerals.
""He's like a tiger,"" his long-time friend Bob Smith, the recently retired president of Barrick, told Reuters. ""If he grabs hold of something, he won't let go. He has a tremendous ability to focus, whether it's recreation or business.""
In the 1950s, Munk, originally from Hungary, started up Clairtone Sound Corp., a stereo company that dazzled Canada until it flopped in 1971.
""Everything I've done afterward has been child's play compared with Clairtone,"" he told author Peter Newman. ""What I learned was never to give away your destiny.""
In 1983, Munk started Barrick, producing 3,000 ounces a year, and built it into the world's third largest gold company with estimated production of 3.2 million ounces for 1996.
Bre-X's Walsh has gone from rags to riches in less than four years. He started as a Montreal stockbroker, was transferred to Calgary, Alberta in the 1980s and then broke out on his own. He concentrated on oil and gas exploration and then switched to mining. But by 1993, his exploration efforts had dried up.
""We had these claims which were worthless, and no money,"" Walsh, 51, told Reuters in a recent interview.
Almost broke, he scraped together C$10,000 ($7,400) to start exploring in Indonesia, pursuading friends to invest C$200,000 ($148,000) for a stake in the area now known as the central Busang.
Walsh hit the jackpot with Busang, which has at least 57 million ounces of gold, currently worth $20 billion.
""It just kept growing,"" Walsh said. ""By July and August (1995) it really appeared it would be a monster discovery.""
He ran Bre-X from the basement of his Calgary home until last year. Bre-X's rocketing stock has made him a multi-millionaire and he now lives in the Bahamas with his wife Jeannette.
But he has one regret. ""We should have been more visible in Indonesia,"" he said. ""I think where we lacked was in making more relationships than we had in Indonesia.""
Bre-X has an alliance with Sigit Harjojudan, the son of Indonesian President Suharto, but observers said Sigit's influence was eclipsed by that of his sister Siti Hardiyanti, with whom Barrick forged an early alliance.
Munk has attracted to his advisory board former U.S. President George Bush, former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and former Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl.
He has ties with politicians in many countries and analysts said those gave him the upper hand with Busang.
Munk and Walsh have tried to tango before. In 1994, they reached an agreement on developing Busang. But last-minute changes from Barrick prompted Bre-X to back out of the deal.
With Barrick's rival Placer Dome Inc. trying to woo the Indonesian government into allowing it to bid on Bre-X, Walsh has made it clear he would rather do business with Placer than with Barrick.

3814,"Nickel giant Inco Ltd., after besting suitors and facing down legal challenges, said said on Wednesday that it has finally closed its C$4.3 billion ($3.2 billion) takeover of Diamond Fields Resources Inc.
The closing gives Inco, already one of the world's biggest nickel miners, a leading role in the nickel market for years to come with the acquisition of the massive copper-cobalt-nickel deposit in remote Voisey's Bay, Labrador, in northeastern Canada.
Diamond Fields shareholders had the choice to take common shares in Inco, cash up to a maximum of C$350 million ($256 million), preferred shares in Inco or a new class of VBN shares to participate directly in the Voisey's Bay deposit.
Inco said Wednesday the full C$350 million was paid out. The company also distributed a total of 50.3 million common shares, 25.9 million Inco class VBN shares and 9.4 million preferred shares as part of the acquisition.
The deal ends a long takeover battle and legal saga. Inco's bid beat out rival Toronto-based Falconbridge Ltd. last spring.
But Inco refused to sign the dotted line when, days before the scheduled closing of the deal, a group of Texans launched a lawsuit against Diamond Fields executives and Inco.
The lawsuit was settled Aug. 5, clearing the way for the deal to go through.
For Inco, the deal was worth fighting for. The Voisey's Bay deposit is thought to be one of the largest metals discoveries in the world.
The site contains an estimated reserve of about 150 million metric tons of ore and will give Inco a solid chunk of the nickel market when production starts up in 1998 or 1999.
The low-cost, high-quality Voisey's Bay project is expected to produce one-third of all new nickel mine output in the next 10 years and force some high-cost nickel projects out of business, analysts have said.
Inco may still face some roadblocks before it gets to that stage, however.
The nickel giant must negotiate with local native groups and win environmental approvals before it can go ahead with production.

3821,"Although a Canadian federal election is not expected to be called until this weekend, the mudslinging has already begun.
Reform Party leader Preston Manning, defensive after charges of racism in his right-wing opposition party, sought to turn the tables on the rival Conservatives on Thursday.
The two parties face a battle for the right-wing vote. Reform won the third most seats in its inaugural national election campaign in 1993, while the Conservatives plummeted to two seats after nine years of rule.
But Reform has been haunted by accusations of racism through its 3-1/2 year term in Parliament.
Questioned by reporters on Thursday about Reform's record on tolerance, Manning accused the Conservatives of choosing a candidate based on race.
Manning produced a clipping from a Vancouver newspaper, which quoted a Conservative official as saying he deliberately sought election candidates who were not Sikh so the candidate could distinguish himself from the other parties' Sikh candidates.
""If we'd said that, we'd be crucified,"" Manning told the National Press Club in Ottawa. He urged the media to challenge the Tories on the comment, but denied he was mudslinging.
""I don't like any of that stuff,"" he said.
A Conservative spokesman brushed off Manning's remarks as ""electioneering.""
The ruling Liberals are widely expected to call an election this weekend for June 2. While recent polls predicted the Liberals would retain power, pre-election campaigning has taken on a bitter flavor, with name-calling and accusations of racism and sexism becoming more frequent.
Liberal Defense Minister Doug Young was criticized recently for sexist remarks. On Tuesday, Reform member of parliament Ian McClelland called Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Sheila Copps a ""bitch"" in the House of Commons and was forced to withdraw his remark.
Also this week, British Columbia Reform official George Rigaux resigned after saying that Sikh leaders were corrupting nominations in his riding. Conservative leader Jean Charest said on Wednesday that voters should be alarmed about charges of racism and sexism surrounding the Reform party.
The Conservative and Reform parties are trying to carve out distinct images as they compete for the conservative vote. In trying to portray itself as a grassroots party, Reform has had to fend off a reputation for extremism.
Last May, Reform members of parliament opposed a Liberal bill to expand rights for homosexuals. One Reform member of parliament said that if he owned a business he would move black or gay employees ""to the back of the shop"" or even fire them if their presence annoyed bigoted customers.
His comments were backed by another Reform member of parliament. Both were disciplined by the Reform caucus.
During the 1993 campaign, Reform had to dump a candidate after he acknowledged making anti-immigrant remarks.

3825,"TVX Gold Inc is taking steps to join the ranks of major mining companies, bringing aboard three senior executives who pledge to turn the company into a million-ounce-a-year gold producer.
""We're here to help TVX grow,"" said Cliff Davis, the new senior vice-president of North American operations, among three officers who joined TVX in the past month.
""We understand the need for organization. We understand realistic plans. I think that's something we can help TVX with,"" Davis told Reuters in an interview.  
Davis's next plan is to speed production at the New Britannia mine in Manitoba and develop more reserves at Casa Berardi in Quebec.
Joining Davis at TVX are David Murray, the recently appointed president and chief operating officer, and Ken Sangster as senior vice-president of European operations.
The three have worked together before. They did stints at mining giant RTZ-CRA Corp Plc and have years of experience with huge projects.  
""For us it was a perfect fit,"" said TVX spokesman Ed Baer. ""One of the things that was a common concern to the market was our lack of management.""
Toronto-based TVX split off from Inco Ltd in 1993 and has concentrated on expanding its assets.
With its interests now growing in Canada, Greece, Brazil, Ecuador, Chile, the Czech Republic and Russia, the company is ready to switch its focus to production, he said.
TVX has promised its shareholders it will be producing 1.1 million ounces of gold a year by the year 2000 from 423,000 ounces in 1995.  
To help keep its promise, the company has placed its bets on the Kassandra Mines in Greece. ""If everything works for us, the story really lies in Greece,"" said Baer.
The property so far is expected to produce 300,000 ounces of gold a year at a cash cost of US$150 an ounce. TVX was still drilling and would not have a clear idea until next spring what the deposit offered, said Baer.
Uncertainty over Kassandra has unsettled TVX stock. Its shares peaked at 14.85 in Toronto during a road show and high gold bullion prices last winter. But the stock has since slid.  
With its stock now trading around 10 on the Toronto Stock Exchange and around 7.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, TVX has been rumored as a takeover target for some major gold producers.
But as a growing company, TVX is always looking for joint ventures and is on the prowl for small mining companies with proven reserves, Baer said.
Davis's first move at TVX was to shut the company's gold mine in Montana earlier this month.
The Mineral Hill mine drained money from the company for years. TVX hoped to revive it with additional ore found at nearby Crevice Mountain, but ore grades at Mineral Hill grew worse and the company could not keep its mill supplied.
Although the company continues to explore at Crevice, Davis did not hold out much hope for a resurrection of mining on the property.
""If it's what it appears to be, we won't reopen,"" he said.

3829,"Nickel prices have been in the doldrums in the third quarter, disappointing Canada's big nickel producers who had forecast an increase in prices and a boost to profits.
Canada's two nickel giants, Inco Ltd and Falconbridge Ltd, are also experiencing copper woes.
The unexpectedly low metal prices ""will likely take a bite out of our third-quarter earnings compared to previous earnings,"" Falconbridge chief financial officer Lars-Eric Johansson said in an interview.
Copper prices collapsed after Sumitomo Corp said its chief trader helped run up US$1.8 billion in losses through unauthorized trading over a decade. Only recently has copper showed signs of life.
For nickel, Johansson blamed the sluggish prices on faltering European and southeast Asian economies.
""In the very short term, the fundamentals are obviously not there,"" he said. ""The overall global economy is not doing as well as we had hoped for.""
But he added: ""We expect the demand for nickel to pick up, maybe not this quarter but during the fourth quarter or to be more conservative, early next year.""
Inco was also optimistic, with Inco executive vice president of marketing Peter Salathiel saying: ""The potential for a nickel spike still exists. The time frame has been shifted from say the first half of '96 to the fourth quarter of '96 or the first quarter of '97.""
Salathiel blamed a glut in stainless steel this year for nickel's poor performance. Stainless steel consumes about two-thirds of the world's nickel output.
Nickel demand and supply are currently on a par, Salathiel said.
He said that with nickel demand expected to remain steady for the next few months, nickel prices should rebound once stainless steel production picks up and the European and Asian economies strengthen.
But Richardson Greenshields analyst Ray Goldie said the nickel price should have picked up by now. He has seen growing demand along with a steady supply, laying the groundwork for a rise in prices.
""The fundamentals have worked beautifully,"" he said.
""Despite gloomy talk about the stainless steel industry, which is the major consuming industry, the most recent figures show nickel consumption is growing. Supply can't keep up and inventories are declining.""
So why did nickel fail to spike?
""The fact that nothing has gone wrong may be one reason,"" said Goldie.
He said that nickel companies produced at capacity with no strikes or disruptions and that it might take such a disruption to knock the nickel price out of joint.
The floundering nickel market could spell trouble for stocks that trade on nickel prices, he added.
The stock market has built in an expectation of a moderate price increase, said Goldie and ""if the price of nickel were to go sideways for the next six months, that would be a disappointment and the shares would go down,"" he said.
""But I don't believe there's an expectation we'll see sustained prices over US$4."" Nickel was trading today at US$3.46 a pound.
Bank of Nova Scotia economist Patricia Mohr predicted nickel prices of at least US$4 a pound by early 1997.
She expected stainless steel stocks to be depleted in the fourth quarter, leading to increased demand for nickel in the first quarter of next year.
""There isn't very much new mine supply coming on in the near future,"" said Mohr. ""So you do have the potential for prices to certainly move higher.""
Analysts expect third-quarter earnings for Inco to fall to US$0.29 a share from year earlier US$0.33, with Falconbridge earnings declining to C$0.18 a share from C$0.47 in last year's third quarter, according to estimates compiled by I/B/E/S.

3831,"With the ruling Liberals far ahead in the polls, the biggest question in the campaign for Canada's June 2 federal election is not who will win but which opposition party will place second.
""It's an election that's quite unlike what you see in other Western countries because there really is no realistic option (aside from the Liberals),"" Reg Whitaker, a political scientist at York University in Toronto, said recently.
""The opposition parties are fighting for small markets. It's wide open for the Liberals.""
Despite opposition criticism of the Liberals' record on national unity, unemployment and taxes, polls show the Liberal party with a consistently strong lead.
The official opposition since the last election in 1993 has been the Bloc Quebecois, whose sole aim is promoting Quebec independence, not forming a federal government. ""They want to put themselves out of business,"" Whitaker said. ""So right off you have a bizarre situation.""
Prime Minister Jean Chretien called the June 2 election on Sunday. In the last election in 1993, the Liberals won 177 out of 295 seats, the Bloc Quebecois 54 seats, the Reform Party 52, the New Democrats nine and the Conservatives two. One independent was elected.
Unless one of two right-wing parties -- the Conservatives and Reform -- can consolidate nationwide support, analysts said, the Bloc was poised to be the official opposition again, keeping the Quebec sovereignty issue on the front burner.
Reform, with strong roots in western Canada but feeble support elsewhere, has painted itself as the only party that can hold the Liberals accountable. But it stops short of seeking the role of government for now.
""Our ultimate objective is to get a Reform government,"" party leader Preston Manning said recently. But when asked about his immediate goal, he said he wanted to win enough seats to form the official opposition.
""They're mainly concerned about holding on to what they've got,"" Whitaker said. Reform had 50 seats when the House of Commons was dissolved on Sunday.
The Conservatives, led by Quebecker Jean Charest, stubbornly maintain they can form the next government, but the right-leaning party has a long way to go. In 1993 the party, one of the oldest in Canada and the ruling party from 1984 to 1993, lost all but two of its seats in the House of Commons.
""They have some severe limitations,"" Whitaker said. ""You see the Conservative Party and the Reform Party fighting over the same right-wing margins.""
Reform and the Conservatives are both campaigning on smaller government and tax cuts as ways to fix Canada's persistent unemployment problem. The Conservatives, however, stand to gain in Quebec, while Reform has no base in the French-speaking province.
A poll in Quebec released on Monday showed support for the Liberals at 37 percent, the Bloc at 35 percent and the Conservatives at 25 percent.
Alone on Canada's left wing is the New Democratic Party, which makes no claims to forming a government.
""Federally, we've never made a government, but we've always been there to make a difference,"" NDP leader Alexa McDonough said as she launched her campaign last weekend.
But the Liberals have co-opted the NDP too, appealing to moderate left-wing Canadians with talk of preserving health care, social programmes and the national pension system, and promoting Liberal legislation on gun control.

3836,"The fight for control of Indonesia's rich Busang gold deposit has turned into an intense public relations battle rather than a traditional bidding war.
Barrick Gold Corp.'s founder and Chairman Peter Munk took the offensive on Wednesday, trumpeting Barrick's history, financial structure and mining capabilities.
Rival Placer Dome Inc. President John Willson has also kept a high public profile, lobbying in Indonesia to pursuade the government to give his company a chance to bid on Busang.
While both companies have been wooing Indonesian reporters, explorer Bre-X Minerals Ltd., which discovered Busang, has hired public relations firm Hill and Knowlton to polish its image.
Calgary, Alberta-based Bre-X currently controls the deposit. The Indonesian government has told Bre-X to form a joint venture with Toronto-based Barrick to develop the 57 million ounce gold deposit. But Placer Dome has said it wants a chance to bid on the deposit too by forming a merger with Bre-X.
""I think that Barrick is the company that is going to be involved in Busang's development,"" Munk said in a Wednesday conference call with mining analysts that seemed instead to be addressed to the Indonesian government.
""Not because somebody writes a letter, not because somebody calls somebody, not because somebody's got a better partner or worse partner, but only because Barrick is the company that has the most outstanding credentials to do the right job for Indonesia,"" he said.
Barrick has been criticized for using its high-profile board of advisers, which includes former U.S. President George Bush and former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, to write letters and make phone calls to powerful Indonesians in a bid to corner Busang. Barrick also has an alliance with the eldest daughter of Indonesian President Suharto.
But Munk downplayed his company's influential ties, citing instead his company's strong finances, mining history, focus on gold and its experienced staff.
""Ultimately the right people will get this job and I think Barrick will qualify,"" Munk said.
Placer Dome's Willson thinks otherwise.
""We've come to a point now where there's a reasonable chance there will be a standard Western-type of auction,"" Willson told Reuters in an interview in Vancouver this week.
""I think there's a 50-50 chance that's going to happen. When it comes to competitive bid, I think there will be two people essentially in that race -- ourselves and Barrick.

His comments were backed by another Reform member of parliament. Both were disciplined by the Reform caucus.
During the 1993 campaign, Reform had to dump a candidate after he acknowledged making anti-immigrant remarks.

3843,"Canada is raising the amount of investment required of prospective immigrants seeking to settle in the country, Immigration Minister Lucienne Robillard said on Friday.
Under a program designed to attract investment, one way foreigners seeking to live in Canada may be granted an immigrant visa is by pledging to invest in the economy.
But Robillard told a news conference the required amount would be raised to avoid abuse and to ensure adequate economic impact.
""While we won't be changing the basic selection criteria for investor entry to Canada, we will be changing the amounts needed to invest, the ways in which that capital can be used and the way in which the program is administered,"" she said.
""It's the most practical way to ensure growth and employment at the local level.""
She denied that passage into Canada was for sale. ""Our citizenship is not for sale in this country,"" she said. ""The amount of money invested is not the only criteria here.""
Investors account for about three percent of total immigration to Canada each year. Currently they must invest $250,000 Canadian ($180,000) to gain entry.
That is being raised to C$450,000 ($325,000) for the richest, most popular destinations -- Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia. For the rest of Canada the rate will rise to C$350,000 ($250,000).
At least 60 percent of the capital must be invested in small and medium-sized businesses. The provinces will be able to direct the remaining 40 percent to their chosen priorities.
The immigrant investor program was introduced in 1986 to attract experienced business people and their money to Canada. The program has attracted C$3.75 billion ($2.74 billion) since its inception and created more than 33,000 jobs, Robillard said.

Representatives of France Telecom and the CDR state holding company, which owns former Credit Lyonnais assets, met to agree the aid package, which has also to win approval from the European Commission in Brussels.
A spokesman for Dutch-based Philips Electronics denied a rumour the company had lodged an official complaint.
One issue that Arthuis has to settle is whether to restart the sale from the beginning and invite new tenders, or to limit negotiations to the two finalists in the orginal process -- the winner Lagardere Groupe and Alcatel Alsthom.
He must also decide whether to abandon France's preference for the defence and electronics group to be sold as a whole rather than in parts. Arthuis has said he his willing to consider a split before a sale.

3854,"The French government on Wednesday called off a controversial sale of the state electronics group Thomson SA to Lagardere Groupe but President Jacques Chirac vowed to bring the sell-off to fruition.
The government, which had doggedly defended its choice amid a storm of employee protest and political opposition, made the U-turn after the independent Privatisation Commission challenged the terms of a South Korean firm's involvement in the sale.
""The French defence electronics industry can lay claim to being world class,"" Chirac's spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said. ""The privatisation of Thomson is key to creating the necessary 'poles of excellence' needed to achieve this ambition.""
""The government will carry (the sale) out in accordance with the terms set on February 22,"" she said, referring to Chirac's televised speech on restructuring the army and defence industry.
Finance Minister Jean Arthuis told reporters the process would be delayed by several weeks, but other politicians said it could stall things for months.
""Unfortunately, the decision to suspend the privatisation process to which the government has had to resort will delay this process by serveral months, possibly even a year,"" said, Francois-Michel Gonnot, a parliamentary committee chairman and member of the ruling coalition.
Lagardere planned to merge Thomson's 58-percent owned defence electronics unit Thomson-CSF with its Matra Defense Espace unit and sell television set and video recorder maker Thomson Multimedia to Korea's Daewoo Electronics.
The Privatisation Commission, France's highest authority on the sale of state assets, said in a confidential report obtained by Reuters that the Daewoo deal did not fully reflect the value of Thomson's technology in digital decoders and flat screens.
The decision to suspend the sale of loss-making Thomson SA was the second embarassing U-turn on a privatisation in two weeks after a decision to suspend the sale of state-owned bank CIC following staff protests and political opposition.
Several thousand workers of Thomson Multimedia marched in Paris and other cities on November 20 to protest against a sale to a booming Asian competitor, fearing for their jobs and working conditions.
The government said in mid-October it had picked Lagardere over rival bidder Alcatel Alsthom because it was best for French defence interests and that it would sell the heavily indebted company for a symbolic one franc after a 10.8 billion franc ($2 billion) state capital injection.
Lagardere shares closed 6.4 percent down at 146.00 francs in Paris after having been suspended in the morning, because investors believed the Thomson deal was good for the company.
Alcatel Alsthom dropped three percent to 460.70 francs because it is now back in the race.
Opposition parties said on Wednesday that they hoped the delay would lead to the total scrapping of the sale plan.
""Today is a first success...but we should not stop there,"" Socialist Party spokesman Francois Hollande said.
""We are now calling for the privatisation to be abandoned totally,"" he said. Communist Party members said they now wanted a national debate on the future of Thomson.
The ruling RPR party said in a statement Hollande was behaving like a ""shipwrecked man who blames his rescuers for his problems in getting afloat.""

3877,"State-owned Gaz de France plans to spend billions of francs upgrading its infrastructure to meet demand growing at an estimated three percent a year.
Chairman Pierre Gadonneix said on Wednesday he was against European rules aimed at liberalising the gas industry because that would focus minds on the short term whereas long term commitments were needed.
""It's extremely difficult to make people understand that while we have for a few more years an abundance of gas, we need long term deals to ensure our medium term needs,"" Gadonneix told reporters at a visit to the ""Artere du Midi"" gas pipeline under construction.
He said European liberalisation could not do for gas what it had done for electricity, noting there were big differences between the two energy sectors.
While all European countries produce electricity, only Britain and the Netherlands export gas in the European Union and the other member states are almost completely dependent on imports from Norway, Russia and north Africa.
""I am not against a spot market,"" Gadonneix said, ""As long as it does not hurt the long term (20-25 years) commitments.""
It takes many years to build a gas infrastructure and in France's case it is far from completed. Gaz de France will have spent 4.5 billion francs on transport and distribution in 1996 and will spend five billion in 1997 with a 10 percent growth rate for many more years to come.
To amortise these investments takes many years. On top of that there is the question of the national security of assuring supply, now arranged by so-called ""take or pay"" contracts.
""The producer takes a risk on the price, we take a risk on the volume,"" Gadonneix said.
He is not in favour of allowing big clients to order natural gas directly from the producer, but he does support the existing European gas transit system. ""The Europe of gas distribution has been working for 30 years, long before people wanted to invent rules for it,"" he said.
Gas firms have agreed deals for the transit of gas, based on a ""normal"" reward for the investment on one side while on the other the advantages of scale are being passed on to the user.
France, due to its geographic position, transits gas from Norway to Spain -- some two billion cubic metres this year, rising to 2.6 billion in 1997.
Gadonneix does not believe that Gaz de France should remain for ever in the hands of the state.
""It does not make a difference. For me there are well-run companies and badly-run companies. We have to serve our clients, take account of our staff and our shareholder whether it is the state or the private sector,"" he said.
The ""Artere du Midi"" pipeline, a one billion franc investment for Gaz de France, links Marseille to Toulouse for the transport of gas from Algeria to the southwest of France. The link will also help to transport gas to Spain.
Gadonneix said that in France gas has a 13 percent share in the market for energy products, against fuel and electricity, while the average for Europe is 20 percent.
""Almost every day of the year we connect a new village,"" he said. This, with the new cogeneration of electricity from gas as well as oil or coal, means that demand will grow by three percent per year, or one billion cubic metres.
For this, the company has two other infrastructure projects, one to land gas from Norway and another for Dutch gas.
Gadonneix is also enthusiastic about new uses of gas and the company will in 1997 start an experiment with an undisclosed town for buses and municipality vehicles to run on natural gas to help cut pollution.

3884,"France Telecom said on Monday it had taken full control of Keystone Communications, a major U.S. television uplink company, to strengthen its position in the North American television market.
Michel Combes, director general of France Telecom's audiovisual transmisson activities, said the acquisition for less than $100 million gave the company a prestigious client list of the U.S. majors as well as an enhanced position in Asia.
""The acquisition boosts our position on the North American market where our main rival is VIVX Global Access,"" Combes said by telephone from Cannes where he is attending the MIDEM audiovisual market fair.
France Telecom, through its Telediffusion De France (TDF) unit, is already leader in the European market with a 20 percent stake, ahead of British Telecommunications Plc and has an estimated 15 percent in the world market. Keystone has a 20 percent share of the North American market.
The market for audiovisual transmission -- the service of carrying television pictures from an event or studio to the broadcasting centre -- is estimated at eight billion francs ($1.5 billion) and seen growing by eight percent per year.
The market of broadcasting pictures to the homes, both direct to home as well as to cable company receivers, is also seen at some eight billion francs.
Total sales of the unit are two billion francs.
This market stands to grow rapidly with the take-off of digital satellite television companies.
France Telecom is partner and service provider to the Television Par Satellite (TPS) digital satellite television venture with TF1, France Television, Lyonnaise des Eaux and Luxembourg's Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Television (CLT).
Combes said that while the world market was seen growing by eight percent, this growth was less pronounced in Europe while Asia would increase at a quicker pace.
TDF has a pact with Japan's KDD as well as NHK and is service provider to Hong Kong's television company.
He said France Telecom wanted ""to have a foothold in Asia"" which he called an ""interesting market with good growth potential"" but he declined to comment on whether to company would make an acquisition soon in the area.
""It is increasingly important that you can provide services for your television clients from whatever place in the world, be it for news or sport,"" Combes said.
France Telecom already had a 40 percent stake in Keystone and bought the remainder from Simmons Group. Together with its Maxat British unit, the three companies are now offering international services under the name ""Global Skylink"".
France Telecom, official operator for the 1998 World Soccer Championships, also has a 20 percent stake in TBA in Argentina.

Industry Minister Franck Borotra received a delegation of Thomson worker representatives who wanted the government to drop the privatisation plans entirely, after the state on Wednesday announced it was suspending the sale.
State-owned Thomson SA comprises 58 percent of defence electronics group Thomson-CSF and all of televison and video recorder maker Thomson Multimedia (TMM).
Some 200 Thomson workers marched through the streets of Paris, welcoming a group of 15 employees that had walked for a week from the Thomson Multmedia plant in Angers in west France.
""Franck Borotra has expressed the government's intention to pursue the (Thomson) privatisation according to terms which will be detailed in the coming days,"" the industry ministry said.
""He has taken note of comments that TMM should be fully valued and reconfirmed the recapitalisation of this company.""
The government on Wednesday suspended the sale, for a symbolic franc, of Thomson SA to Lagardere Groupe because the independent Privatisation Commission could not agree with the terms of Lagardere's planned sale of Thomson Multimedia to Daewoo Electronics of South Korea.
The French Foreign Ministry on Friday, asked by an irritated South Korea to explain itself, issued a statement aimed at easing the strain on its ties with an important trade partner.
The ministry said France and South Korea enjoyed relations of ""respect, partnership and confidence"".
Inside Thomson's Paris headquarters, state shareholders voted to back a capital increase needed to bolster the company's balance sheet ahead of an eventual sale.
The shareholders are a handful of representatives for the state, telecom operator France Telecom and a pool of banks represented by the state-owned Caisse des Depots et de Consignations (CDC).
Thomson said afterwards that the state would pay the bill, but the aid still needs EU approval.
At the end of 1995, Thomson SA had debts of 25.3 billion francs of which 13.8 billion were at TMM and 2.3 billion at Thomson-CSF.
Finance Minister Jean Arthuis said on Thursday he was not ruling out any options, including whether Thomson-CSF and TMM should be sold seperately rather than in one go.
In February, President Jacques Chirac made the privatisation conditional on the group remaining intact.
The Les Echos business newspaper said that if the government insisted on a package sale, Alcatel stood the best chances of winning.
Alcatel Alsthom chairman Serge Tchuruk, whose rival offer had been sidelined by the government in October, recently suggested the state should sell Thomson SA intact but in stages.

3892,"The French government is moving edgily towards a key decision for the future of Europe's defence industry -- whether to privatise defence electronics group Thomson-CSF through a public sale or private placement.
The stakes are huge, as the choice of the method of sale will to a large extent determine the final outcome of a far-reaching restructuring in the French defence industry and has major implications for the entire sector in Europe.
Like a master chess player, the state must look several moves ahead, decide what sort of defence industry it wants to see in a few years' time, and ensure the decision will be seen as fair to all involved.
Government sources said on Friday that the decision, originally expected at the end of January, would probably slip into early February because the government was studying in great detail all the elements of the politically-sensitive dossier that involves Europe's biggest defence electronics company.
""The decision will be taken shortly, but not today. We are still studying all possibilities,"" said an official source.
""The decision will have to be taken by the cabinet. At the moment there is no proposal to send to the ministers. I could not tell you when exactly that will happen,"" he added.
Prime Minister Alain Juppe is anxious to avoid another embarassment like the one he suffered on December 4 when the government had to suspend an earlier privatisation plan under which Thomson-CSF would have gone to conglomerate Lagardere Groupe.
That deal involved the privatisation of the Thomson group, which included both a 68 percent stake in Thomson-CSF and 100 percent of consumer electronics group Thomson Multimedia (TMM).
The state was forced to call off the plan because the independent privatisation commission balked at the terms of a sale of TMM to South Korea's Daewoo Electronics.
The cancellation outraged the Korean, who called the decision racist and prompted an angry call for explanation from President Kim Young-sam.
Since then the French government has decided to separate the sales of TMM and Thomson-CSF.
The ultimate aim of the government is to have a strong defence industry able to supply its armed forces with state-of-the art weaponry and play a leading role in Europe and on the world scene.
A year ago, President Jacques Chirac announced a wide-ranging restructuring of the French defence industry around a merged group of Aerospatiale and Dassault Aviation for aerospace, and Thomson-CSF for electronics.
In France alone, any such restructuring would affect the business of Lagardere, owner of Matra Espace Defense with British Aerospace Plc as a partner, Alcatel Alsthom and its ally GEC Plc, and smaller groups such as Sagem and Compagnie des Signaux.
With a public sale through a market float, Thomson-CSF management will have its hands free to pursue its own negotiations about future alliances while interested partners can acquire stakes on the market.
But this may mean that a foreign cash-rich group from elsewhere in Europe or from the U.S. or Asia could buy itself into the talks.
With a private placement there are two main options.
One is by choosing candidates for a sale using a ""cahier de charges"" -- a sort of bidding book comprising price, intended strategy and commitments on jobs and investments.
This would leave the government with the biggest influence on the outcome, but also with the biggest responsibilty.
Another procedure, rare in France, would be to auction the state's 68-percent stake in Thomson-CSF among qualified bidders, putting the emphasis on price and ensuring the greatest possible revenues for the state at a time France is trying to reduce its public deficits ahead of monetary union.

3903,"The Czech Republic took a large step on Wednesday toward ending more than 50 years of total dependence on Russia for natural gas, finalising a 20-year supply agreement with Norway.
Czech Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy told a business forum, including Norwegian King Harald, that the deal should allow for gas supplies to begin from May 1, and gradually wean Prague from Russian gas.
Although Prague's political domination by Moscow ended with its 1989 democratic revolution, the Czechs still rely on Russia for most of its energy needs and Russian raw materials remain a major element of Czech imports.
""I am pleased and honoured to say...that the final negotiations were completed,"" Dlouhy told the forum, which also included Norwegian government and business officials.
Dlouhy said that under the deal, supplies would increase from 1.4 million cubic metres a day to around three billion cubic metres annually. The total supply as laid out by the agreement should be 53 billion cubic metres (bcm).
The ministry was considering other options including potential deals with German, Dutch and British suppliers or a second delivery route of Russian gas.
But Dlouhy told journalists after the announcement: ""We picked Norway because it was economically very advantageous.""
No financial terms of the agreement were disclosed.
The deal is expected to be presented to the government in the coming weeks, which must first approve it before state-owned gas transporter Transgas will sign a final contract.
A consortium of Norwegian firms, including Statoil, Norsk Hydro ASA and Saga Petroleum ASA, is involved in the deal, though the Norwegian government must still decide which gas producing platforms the supplies will come from.
The deal, on the eve of a summit between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin where Czech NATO membership is to be discussed, also comes soon after Russia's ambassador to Prague hinted of economic reprisals should the Czechs join the western security alliance.
Czech officials say moves to build a pipeline linking Prague to Middle Eastern oil from the Adriatic Sea, to buy U.S. supplied nuclear fuel for Czech power plants, and the Norway gas deal, complete ""strategic long-term targets"".
Czechs consume around nine bcms per year of natural gas, with demand expecting to rise to 12 to 13 bcms after the turn of the century. Russia's Gazprom is still expected to remain a main supplier to the Czechs.
The deal also signals an expected push in the sector by Norway into central and eastern Europe. Statoil officials at the signing said the firm is also looking to supply Poland and Hungary with natural gas.
""There's a lot of interest to supply other central European countries as well,"" Egio Haaland, Statoil marketing manager for eastern Europe said, adding the amount of gas delivered to the Czechs would be just under what supplies to Hungary and Poland would be.

3910,"The Czech government on Wednesday directed three of its ministers to oversee an investigation into the failure of the bank Kreditni Banka a.s., Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said.
The move comes after the press and opposition questioned official banking oversight in the case of the Plzen-based bank which was shut by the central bank last month after reportedly losing about 12 billion crowns.
Klaus told a news conference after a cabinet meeting that Czech National Bank (CNB) Governor Josef Tosovsky would join Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik, Justice Minister Jan Kalvoda, and Interior Minister Jan Ruml in overseeing the probe.
""Bearing in mind the extraordinary importance of this matter, the govenrnment authorised the group of three ministers to specially inquire into this issue, using all existing standard mechanisms,"" Klaus said.
He said authorities have been investigating the Kreditni case since the central bank rescinded its licence in August.
Findings from the investigation might lead to changes in Czech legislation, Klaus said.
Local media reports have placed the blame for the failure of Kreditni Banka, majority owned by the largest Czech insurer Ceska Pojistovna a.s. , on a series of murky loans made to interests connected to shareholders.
The leader of the opposition Social Democrats, Milos Zeman, last weekend blamed Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik and his ministry for lax supervision of the banks.
After Klaus's announcement, the central bank issued a statement on Wednesday, saying it welcomed the group of ministers looking at whether there was any criminal actions involved in Kreditni's failure.
It said combining the investigatory organs with, tax, legal, banking oversight, and capital market authorities, would help in ""uncovering illegal activity"" and determining its punishment.
""The CNB believes that through this work it will be possible to solve other cases as well in which the banking supervision has submitted a number of criminal reports on the basis of its knowledge gained in other banks,"" the central bank's statement said.
Eleven banks have fallen under CNB authority since the liberalisation of the sector began in earnest in 1992.
Klaus attributed the failures of the banks -- all of them small or medium sized -- to growing pains in the still-transforming post-Communist Czech economy.
""I am 100 percent persuaded that the dominant cause of these phenomenona... is the difficulity, fragility, complexity of banking in the transformation phase,"" Klaus said.
Klaus, in numerous previous speeches has declared that the ""transformation phase"" was over and the economy was ""in the fitness centre building muscle"".
But Klaus has been under pressure by opposition deputies who have demanded answers on the banking failures.
""The government condemns the way of politicising of this important situation by the opposition, which could intendidly or not, lead to the destabilisation of the the whole banking system,"" Klaus said.

The result surprised analysts although it kept average inflation well over the government's 1996 target of eight percent.
Radek Maly, an economist with Citibank in Prague, said: ""It is very low, I expected the month-on month inflation to be over 0.6 percent, and the year-on-year figure to get over ten percent.""
The Statistical Bureau (CSU) said a hike in regulated natural gas and power prices sparked a 3.2 percent month-on-month increase in housing prices, the main impetus for August inflation.
Food, beverages and tobacco products actually showed a price drop in August of 1.4 percent, thanks to a 29.5 percent fall in potato prices and 25.9 percent decrease of vegetables.
""What was totally surprising to me was the fall in the foods index, and considering its (large) weighting, it obviously pulled the whole figure down. The whole structure looks very well,"" Maly said.
The CSU in July raised its average inflation forecast for the whole year to 9.0 percent, and Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said the cabinet based its 1997 budget calculations on an inflation expectation of ""not below"" eight percent.
Klaus did not specify if he meant the year-on-year or the moving average rate.
Maly said the August result might help the 1996 figure to finish below nine percent, but nowhere near the government's earlier target.

""Unisys has submitted...a proposal for investigation of the decision of the Defence Minister of the Czech Republic,"" the company said in a statement.
Last week, Defence Minister Miloslav Vyborny rejected a first round appeal by Unisys and IBM Corp saying he believed his decision in March to award a 1.3 billion crown army information system deal to EDS-Digital was correct.
Installation of the staff information system is seen as a large step on the Czech army's path to compatibility with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's military command.
Vyborny chose EDS-Digital despite a recommendation by a steering committee to chose Unisys's bid.
""By this step (the appeal), Unisys is continuing in its effort for recognition of its victory in the public tender...because it is convinced of the seriousness of its arguments,"" the statement said.
Vyborny has said that he decided in favour of EDS-Digital due to the lower price of its bid. Unisys has said that price was not weighted in accordance with the tender rules, and that EDS-Digital's offer was not complete. EDS declined to comment.
Unisys won an original four billion crown supply tender last year, but it was cancelled in August when competition authorities found irregularities in the process.
Vyborny said after the second tender that the ministry had decided to ignore the recommendation of the tender committee also because some members' evaluations were far different than the rest of the committee.
Unisys has said it was suspicious that the original tender was abolished and rankings were changed when it won again.
""Unisys is proposing cancellation of the decision and hopes the government of the Czech Republic will deal with the situation around this strategic order,"" Unisys added.

They said the still illiquid stock -- which first listed on the Prague Stock Exchange (PSE) last Thursday at 2,290 crowns ($82.76), dipped to 2,170 this week before Friday's fixing at 2,245 -- faced uncertainty because of recent acquisitions.
""The problem is information, we don't know where acquisitions were financed from, we haven't seen the balance sheet from last year,"" said Jan Zak of Atlantik Financial Markets.
Chemapol spent an estimated 12 billion crowns in an acquisition spree last year. It now controls about 70 companies with combined equity of about 20 billion crowns.
Analysts agreed it was potentially an interesting stock, but much more transparency was needed.
Anna Bossong, analyst at ING Barings, said Chemapol would have trouble with a planned 600 million crown issue of global depository receipts (GDR) expected later this year if the company is not more forthcoming.
""I think it would be very difficult. One of the problems this company has is a difficulty with transparency. Increased transparency would be the first thing foreign investors look to before they would invest into GDRs,"" Bossong told Reuters.
Chemapol originally planned the issue for the last year, but then delayed it, saying domestic investors had already sufficient demand for the nominal 826 million crowns in new shares issued last autumn.
Most of the new issue was gobbled up by existing shareholders which includes six major local banks -- Komercni Banka, Ceska sporitelna, IPB, Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, Agrobanka and Union Banka -- and management.
Only a handful of shares have traded on the PSE since it was listed last week.
Chemapol's empire grew from an oil trading company -- a business it partially lost to local refineries -- to include major chemical companies, a small airline, a publishing house, an arms trading firm and sports franchises and clubs.
It is also competing in a tender for a more than one-third stake in the largest Czech defence firm, the debt-strapped jet maker Aero Vodochody a.s.
Chemapol's spokesman Vadim Petrov said the conglomerate is aiming to improve the information flow. ""That is a process we are working on intensively,"" he said.
It has yet to reveal 1996 results. Petrov said they would be released when an audit is finished, probably in April.
On January 1, the firm adopted a new structure creating sub-holdings grouping its distribution, trading, chemical, communications and real estate holdings.
""The new structure is quite good... the sub-holding arrangement is logical and the acquisitions, especially in the chemical industry, logically chain on,"" said Atlantik's Zak.
But Ondrej Vojtech of Akro Capital warned: ""The acquisition policy is known to be too broad-minded, and I have the feeling that they are trying to get money from everywhere.""
Petrov said this year Chemapol would try to stabilise and consolidate its holdings, and is not planning any large acquisitions, apart from the potential Aero stake.
The group posted audited net profit of 62.5 million crowns in 1995. It had total sales of over 40 billion crowns in 1995 and 29 billion crowns in the first half of 1996.

3943,"Opposition leader Milos Zeman urged the Czech parliament on Wednesday to approve a separate resolution to ""clarify"" his concerns about a post-World War Two reconciliation pact with Germany.
But deputies in Zeman's own Social Democratic party (CSSD) admitted that the votes were probably were still there to push the deal with Germany through parliament and save the Czech government from embarrassment.
On the second day of debate on the declaration, which has already been signed by the Prague and Bonn governments and approved by the German parliament, Zeman demanded the accompanying rider.
""I would want to believe this parliament would find the courage to express itself on the declaration in its resolution, as the parliament of a sovereign state,"" he said.
Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus's three-party conservative coalition, which is two seats short of a majority in the lower house, has rejected any sort of extra resolution which may ""interpret"" the already-signed declaration.
In the accord, Bonn expresses regret for the 1938-45 Nazi occupation of Czech lands and Prague expresses sorrow for brutality in the post-war expulsion of 2.5 million ethnic Germans.
The text also includes German support for Czech membership of the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO).
It skirts around the most sensitive issues of direct compensation for property seized from the expelled Germans.
German politicians sympathetic to their families, who now mostly live in southern Germany, have said that the issue of individual compensation for property was still open, despite the inter-governmental declaration.
Zeman said comments made by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl after he signed the document, and later by Finance Minister Theo Waigel, showed that Bonn considered the ""property problems"" still unresolved.
""These subsequent statements are the basic reason for my concern,"" he said.
CSSD vice-chairman Karel Machovec said that while the additional resolution, which has yet to be presented, might help to ensure a larger majority for the declaration, the government probably had the votes to win.
""I know about three or four Social Democrats who would vote for the declaration,"" Machovec told Reuters, saying he would be among those voting for the deal.
The debate in the Czech lower house looked set to last late into the week, with small opposition parties attempting filibusters and other procedural moves to block the declaration from coming to a vote.
The ultra-right Republican Party and the Communist Party say the declaration lets Germany off lightly for Nazi attrocities and the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia.

3960,"Hewlett-Packard Co. said it plans to introduce a photographic system for personal computer users capable of snapping, scanning and printing photography-quality images.
The company's new PhotoSmart line, aimed at the consumer digital photography which some industry experts expect to heat up this year, will not come cheaply, however.
The company's photo printer, scanner and digital camera can be purchased independently but together cost about $1,400, while new ink cartridges will cost roughly $40 each.
And while any paper can be used in the printer, for best results HP recommends its own glossy and deluxe glossy photography paper, to be priced in the United States at up to $1.10 a page for the finest quality.
A spokesman for HP said the products are initially aimed at photography enthusiasts.
HP cited figures from the Photo Marketing Association which estimated that in 1995 some 710 million rolls of film were processed, or an estimated 2.5 billion pictures.
Although the quality of consumer market digital cameras themselves is still well below that of conventional photography, HP's scanning device enables PC users to scan, edit and print images made with conventional photography as well.
The HP PhotoSmart products work with Microsoft Corp.'s Windows 95 operating system and at least a 66- megahertz 486 processor, although Intel Corp.'s Pentium chips are recommended.
Both the printer and scanner, which will be available beginning in May, require a 2x-speed CD-ROM device, although a 4x-speed CD-ROM is recommended.
The printer, priced at about $500, requires at least 16 megabytes of random access memory (RAM) and 80 megabytes of hard disk storage, although double as much RAM and 120 megabytes of storage are recommended.
HP's PhotoSmart scanner, priced at $500 in the U.S. market, requires eight megabytes of RAM, a SCSI card and 25 megabytes of hard disk space, although 16 megabytes of RAM and 50 megabytes of hard disk space are recommended.
Photography professionals said the difference between the output of the new HP devices and conventional photo printing methods can be detected by experts, but that the two are very similar in quality.
HP's new inkjet printing system will enable people to print their pictures right away at home, although the results will not be instantaneous.
An eight-by-ten-inch picture takes an average five minutes to print and will take three to 20 minutes to dry, depending on the paper, print quality and humidity.
HP has been working with companies to expand PC photography standards. Last week, it unveiled a new standard to promote browsing, distributing and printing high-resolution images over the Internet.

3969,"USWeb Corp Chairman and Chief Executive Joe Firmage on Monday said the fast-growing Internet services company had launched the second stage of its business plan, agreeing to acquire affiliates in six U.S. metropolitan areas.
Firmage, who started the Santa Clara-based company just 13 months ago, said the second phase of the plan called for the expansion of its corporate-owned operations. He said USWeb would also expand outside the United States, particularly in Southeast Asia and Japan, by the end of October.  
Next year, USWeb will concentrate on profitability, he said. ""In January 1998 the focus is on leveraging what we built,"" Firmage said in an interview in Palo Alto.
He said the company was seeking to achieve economies of scale in the market for services related to building Internet sites and intranets -- internal corporate computer networks that take advantage of inexpensive Internet technologies.
Firmage said USWeb in its first phase succeeded in building a string of franchises in 54 locations in 26 states, including recent affiliates in Austin, Texas., Seattle, Pittsburgh, and Irving and Laguna Hills, Calif.  
The chief executive said USWeb had also succeeded in building a strong name and thus a currency for expansion. A recent study rated USWeb third among information technology executives for brand awareness, behind AT&amp;T Corp and MCI Communications Corp, he said.
Firmage said the company was close to arranging a second round of financing. Last year, USWeb raised $17 million from Softbank Corp of Japan and Crosspoint Ventures, which valued USWeb at $31 million, he said.  
Firmage declined to project the size of any new investment.
By next year, the company's expansion should help USWeb become ""broad and deep and profitable,"" he said, declining to elaborate on expected profit margins.
Firmage said more than 50 percent of USWeb's business was ""the $50,000 to $1 million range of companies setting up business-critical sites for department-sized operations.  
That work, and even much of the business of setting up enterprise-wide sites ranging in value from $500,000 to $3.0 million, is below the horizon of some of the bigger high-technology consulting firms, he added.
Firmage said Internet technologies accounted for an increasing share of the $20 billion information technology out-sourcing market.
The affiliates that USWeb is acquiring are in Washington, San Francisco, the New York City area, Orange County, Calif., Philadelphia, and Milwaukee.
Firmage declined to discuss when or whether the company may consider an initial public stock offering. But, he said, with the current moribund IPO market and declining share prices, ""the private market is the place to be right now.""
Meanwhile, acquisition offers the owners of its franchises a way of creating some liquidity in their holdings, he said.
""There's no question that this does open the possibility of liquidity,"" he said. ""We have a liquidity path.""
USWeb's operations now encompass some 400 to 500 people. The company will hold its semiannual affiliate meeting, known as Velocity, in San Francisco next week.

3971,"Netcom On-Line Communications, Inc. on Monday unveiled a new multi-tier pricing policy, with price points ranging from $24.95 to thousands of dollars a month.
Netcom said it would ""grandfather"", or maintain current customers, at the present $19.95 flat rate, but will introduce a ""fair usage"" policy which will over time limit these users from hogging bandwidth at peak hours, for example.  
Netcom Chairman and CEO David Garrison told Reuters in an interview the company continues to grow very rapidly, and expects the pricing plan to boost revenues.
""Our company continues to grow very rapidly,"" he said ahead of the announcement. ""We think that (the new pricing plan) will result in increased revenues above where we would have gotten.""
""We were operating profit positive in the fourth quarter in the United States operations and we would expect to continue that way,"" he said.  
But he added that ""We don't expect to see the full impact of this until the third and fourth quarter of this year.""
The $24.95 a month Netcomplete Advantage service provides 28.8 kilobits per second access along with an extra mailbox, blocking software, financial and anti-virus software.
Netcomplete Advantage Pro adds premium support and access to online research libraries for $29.95 a month.
Both services have a $25 set-up fee.  
Among its business services, which Garrison said could range up to monthly fees in the thousands of dollars, are new Web hosting services priced at $125 a month with a one-time $150 set-up fee.
Garrison said the company was seeking to show ""leadership in a business that's sort of gone haywire.""
He said the pricing plan was developed after collating responses from more than 25,000 subscribers. ""It was important that somebody lead the industry away from this craziness,"" he added.
The largest U.S. consumer online service, America Online Inc, raised a rage of protest and lawsuits after it announced a $19.95 a month flat fee Internet access plan and couldn't keep up with demand for access.
Garrison said the company's research provided an answer of ""a resounding no"" to whether it could provide a ""successful business that is $19.95, has unlimited access, unlimited usage and quality service.""
Garrison said the Netcom plan is geared towards active Internet users who frequently combine the Internet usage with their business day and require access from work, home and on the road. ((sam.perry@reuters.com, Palo Alto Bureau 415 846 5400))

3972,"Intel Corp., the world's biggest maker of computer chips, said Tuesday its workers received about $820 million in cash bonuses, profit sharing and retirement pay for the company's record year in 1996.
""The average employee received a minimum of about 33 percent payout over their base salary for the year -- about four months of extra income,"" Intel Chief Operating Officer Craig Barrett told reporters in a conference call.
For an entry-level hourly worker earing $25,000 a year, the combined package of added compensation and benefits for last year amounts to roughly $8,000 extra, Intel said.
""We think it's also been a phenomenal benefit to our shareholders by motivating our employees to do the best possible job they can for our shareholders and our customers,"" said Barrett, who will become Intel's president this spring.
Intel said the $820 million in 1996 cash profit-sharing and retirement contributions exceeded the company's total 1981 revenues and was roughly equal to its 1991 net income.
Profits at the Santa Clara-based semiconductor company, which supplies the microprocessors used in four out of every five personal computers shipped, last year soared to $5.2 billion as revenues hit $20.8 billion.
Barrett said he did not begrudge employees any of the extra benefits from contributing to record results, and the company now plans to make all its employees eligible for stock options beginning with its next plan, which starts in April.
""This outstanding year would not have been possible without the remarkable efforts of Intel employees around the world,"" said Barrett, heir apparent to Intel CEO Andy Grove.
Intel ended 1996 with a workforce of around 48,500.
Separately, Intel Chief Financial Officer Andy Bryant told an investment conference in New York City that Intel remained on track in the first quarter to meet its financial targets, as personal computer unit sales continue to grow.
The stock of Intel closed up 12.5 cents at $151.75 on the Nasdaq market, where it was third most heavily-traded.
Barrett said the company last year paid out $214 million, or the equivalent of 26.9 days' salary for each Intel employee, under the Employee Cash Bonus Program. All employees receive the cash profit-sharing in six-month installments.
In 1996, the company also extended its Employee Bonus profitability-based program to all employees. The plan, based on growth in Intel earnings and achievement of an employee's business group goals, paid out a total of $360 million.
A one-time bonus marking Intel's record-breaking year paid $1,000 to each U.S. employee and a locally adjusted figure to each non-U.S. employee, or a total of $45 million.
Intel said that for the ninth consecutive year it contributed the maximum allowed by law to its employee retirement program, or 12.5 percent of employees' pay -- a figure which totaled about $200 million.
Intel has sought to build one of the corporate world's most innovative compensation and benefits packages as a way of attracting top employees and to reward them for contributing to the company's long-term growth and profitability.
Intel, whose shares have vaulted 180 percent in the past year despite moribund results at many rival semiconductor companies, said it was one of only a small number of companies to have instituted an across-the-board options plan.
Even the lowest-level hourly workers will receive options to buy a minimum of 50 shares in a five-year plan in which the employee gains one-fifth of the allotment each year. Barrett said Intel also spends roughly 6 percent to 7 percent of its payroll, or around $150 million, on employee training each year to help employees advance in their careers.
Barrett said Intel's generous compensation plan and the hardships at other companies resulted in lower jobs turnover last year. He declined to specify the exact turnover rate, but said ""We're in the relatively low single-digit range.""

3981,"Novell Inc. Tuesday named Eric Schmidt, a prime architect of Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Internet and Java language strategy, as its chairman and chief executive officer.
Schmidt, who will join Novell April 7, will be charged with re-energising the network software company, which has been involved in a head-to-head battle with software giant Microsoft Corp..
Over the last 18 months, Novell has managed to dispose of software applications WordPerfect and Quattro Pro, which had been acquired by former Novell chief executive officer Ray Noorda in a failed effort take on industry leader Microsoft.
Analysts and industry executives, some of whom were startled by the move, said Schmidt had the energy and intellect to help hone the company's strategy and to draw talented but scarce developers to its ranks.
""A lot of guys want to ride at the front,"" one analyst said of Schmidt's move to the chief executive position.
Schmidt, who joined Sun in 1983 as a manager of software, said the opportunity to run Novell would fulfil ""a lifelong dream"" of heading up a company in the industry.
In recent months, Schmidt has emerged as a main spokesman for development of the Internet and of Sun's effort to promote the Java language, designed to enable software to run on virtually all computer systems.
These skills will be critical at Novell, analysts said, where former Hewlett-Packard Co. Chairman John Young has been serving as chairman since last August when former Novell CEO Robert Frankenberg stepped down, just as the company was gearing up a new Internet focus.
Young will move to the post of vice-chairman.
Chris Le Tocq, an industry analyst at Dataquest, said Schmidt ""will bring the vision"" Novell has been lacking.
Despite facing competitive pressure from Microsoft, Novell still has the No. 1 market share in network operating systems.
Joe Marengi, Novell's president and chief operating officer who was serving as acting CEO since Frankenberg's departure, said Novell currently claims 60 million users worldwide.
""I think it's a very defensible position and, in fact, one that we can grow very rapidly, in my personal view,"" Schmidt said of Novell's market position.
In addition to competing with Microsoft in advanced networking features, Schmidt said the company will work to make sure its software works well on both Microsoft's Windows NT and Unix networking environments.
Schmidt received a degree in electrical engineering from Princeton University and a doctorate in computer science from the University of California at Berkeley. He has worked at Xerox Corp.'s Palo Alto Research Centre, at Bell Laboratories and Zilog Inc.

3984,"Internet start-up companies continue to plunge into a fiercely competitive, still-embryonic market -- but major investors expect an equally fast shake-out in the next few months.
Internet security, Internet-based telephone service and Web publishing were among the vibrant but increasingly crowded sectors for new products and services from more than 60 companies demonstrating their wares at an industry conference in San Diego.
""There are a lot of things here that are products, not companies,"" said Thomas Winter, general partner at Onset Ventures in Austin, Texas, after viewing demonstrations at the three-day Upside/David Coursey Internet Showcase.
What separates the Internet market from previous start-up investment booms like personal computers and biotechnology, venture capitalists say, is the potential market opportunity is expected to be far broader.
John Doerr, the Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers venture capital guru often hailed as someone who starts whole industries rather than just companies, calculates the Internet venture market is taking off at three times the velocity of the PC industry 15 years ago.
Yet the speed also means sectors of the Internet industry have gone through consolidation phases far more rapidly than more mature industries.
Just a year ago, four Internet search and navigation companies were hitting the public market. But, shortly after that, merger activity began swiftly for other, non-public navigation services.
Some industry executives and venture investors are already seeing a similar phenomenon in other areas. With the cool state of the market for initial public offerings, many companies are expected to seek corporate investment or buyouts.
Many have shifted their business plans to the corporate market in an effort to win corporate information technology dollars. Partly, this is also due to a view that public Internet access will not speed up any time soon.
""There's no panacea in the bandwidth area,"" said Intel Corp. executive Victor Varney, using the industry term for the speed of an Internet connection. Varney noted that an independent survey projects that by the year 2000 fewer than 20 percent of individuals will have speedier connections than a common phone line.
One example of overcrowding in an Internet business sector is the category of ""push computing"" where more than two dozen companies are competing, including Net software heavyweights Microsoft Corp. and Netscape Communications Corp.
Many industry executives expect Microsoft and Netscape will turn push technology -- the automatic delivery of customized information over the Internet to computer users -- into a commodity market, leaving room for only a few providers.
Venture capitalists see this as an example of a broader shake-out in the Internet business.
""I think we're still deeply into the settling-out period,"" Onset Venture's Winter said.
""Is push going to be a business? It may turn out to be a technology like AI (artificial intelligence),"" rather than a full-blown business, he said.
The pace of the initial public offering (IPO) market for Internet start-ups was at its most frantic last spring when some companies gained $1 billion initial market valuations despite little promise of sustainable profits.
At the time, investment bankers joked you could write ""Internet"" on a dollar bill and they could take it public for $10, but no longer.
""Within six months 'Internet' is going to be a nasty word to use in an IPO. I predict no company going public will want to be an Internet company by then,"" said one industry executive.
Nevertheless, major companies like microprocessor maker Intel are seeking to drive adoption of Internet technologies forward and to encourage continued entrepreneurial investment, partly to ensure the continued growth of their own businesses.
""We don't think there has been enough thinking through of new content capabilities of the Internet,"" said Varney, who predicts one day there will be ""a much more aggressive integration of the Internet than we see today.""

3985,"Intel Corp. stock fell for the third straight day Friday on concerns that a series of upcoming price cuts could slow the company's momentum.
The stock tumbled $6.75 to $130.50, off a total of $16.125, or roughly 11 percent, since Tuesday.
The fall led the entire market lower, and analysts cited nervousness about Intel's first-quarter results, due after the market close on Monday. The earnings report will serve as a critical barometer of whether strong corporate earnings can keep underpinning stock values.
Industry analysts said Intel's quarterly price cuts on Pentium processors are expected to lead to slightly lower prices for personal computers. Some speculated that in expectation of rival chips, such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc.'s new K6, Intel will cut Pentium prices more than usual, from 25 percent to 30 percent.
""This continues to fuel normal PC demand,"" said Kimball Brown, an analyst with Dataquest Inc in San Jose, Calif. ""This is the normal stuff that keeps stimulating the market.""
According to First Call, which tracks Wall Street estimates, analysts expect Intel to report a first-quarter profit of $2.07 a share, up from $1.02 a year ago, when Intel posted net income of $894 million on revenues of $4.64 billion.
If Intel meets those expectations, it will be the second straight quarter in which the world's largest maker of computer chips has more than doubled its year-on-year profits.
An Intel spokesman said the company could not comment this close to its earnings report, but the company said in mid-March -- within two weeks of the close of the quarter -- that market fundamentals ""remain very strong.""
Intel executives told analysts in January they expect revenues to be around $6.4 billion, about even with what it reported in the fourth quarter. Gross margins -- the difference between revenue and the costs of goods -- are expected to be even with or below the fourth quarter's 63 percent.
Analysts said Intel's bellwether role -- it has recently made a habit of re-energizing flagging stock markets with particularly upbeat earnings reports -- is especially crucial given Wall Street's current moodiness.
Wall Street is particularly wary of the outlook for corporate earnings following the Federal Reserve's March 25 decision to raise interest rates and fresh speculation about chances of another rate increase based on Friday's report of underlying price pressures at the wholesale level in March.
""People are scared. Intel is one of the biggest holdings and they can still sell it at a profit,"" said David Wu, high-tech analyst at ABN AMRO Chicago Corp. ""They're scared because tech stocks are going down. If technology stocks can't do corporate earnings, you can forget about the rest.
Analysts said the much-heralded ""whisper"" number for Intel is for it to make $2.15 a share, and that even $2.20 a share could be possible given another blow-out quarter.
But, one analyst cautioned, ""anything less than $2.15 would not be good"" for the market.
Market researcher Dataquest said last week that Intel will continue to dominate the personal computer industry, where its processors currently account for 95 percent of the market, although clone-makers will start to make inroads this year.
Intel spokesman Howard High said Friday the company will continue with its routine quarterly pricing changes, but that he saw no unusual changes in the upcoming pricing pattern from that to which the PC industry has grown accustomed.
""We do our price declines in a pretty predictable, orderly fashion,"" he said.
Analysts expect Intel to cut some prices when it unveils its new high-end Pentium II chip next month, and High said Intel's practice is to ""move other products down a notch"" to make room for the new processors.
""The movement is always in a relatively consistent direction, which is down. The rate is dependent on market conditions ... They (the pricing reductions) seem to have been pretty constant over the years,"" he added.
In February, Intel's pricing changes for its Pentium and Pentium Pro family of microprocessors ranged from no change at all to roughly a 34 percent decline, he noted.
Intel's processors range in price from around $100 for the lower-end, older models to over $1,000 for the highest-end chips.

3997,"Silicon Graphics Inc. said it will launch a new line of computer workstations Monday as the company moves to fend off the threat of increasingly high-powered personal computers.
The new line of Octane workstations fills out the broadest revamp ever of Silicon Graphics' product line. It includes a powerful new design aimed at bolstering its No. 3 position in the market for workstations running the Unix operating system.
The Mountain View, Calif.-based company discussed its new products in interviews ahead of Monday's formal release.
Silicon Graphics will also shave the prices of its Indigo2 Impact 10000 workstations by up to 22 percent as it aims to position the line between its entry-level O2 machines, introduced in October, and the new Octane models.
The powerful machines are typically used by engineers in intensive number-crunching tasks ranging from oil exploration and molecular modeling to flight simulation, computer-aided design and video and television.
The new Octanes share many of their components with the company's new supercomputing design unveiled in October and feature technology that greatly increases the speed with which data moves between its components.
""What SGI has done is eliminate most of the chokepoints, and you get the full effects of most of the microprocessor"" that is the heart of the computer, said David Weisberg, publisher of the newsletter Engineering Automation Report in Englewood, Colo.
Weisberg and industry analysts said such performance was important to Silicon Graphics' effort to fend off the threat to its traditional high-end graphics markets by increasingly powerful PCs built with Intel Corp. microprocessors running Microsoft Corp.'s Windows NT operating system. Shipments of the computers based on what analysts have dubbed the ""Wintel"" PC architecture surpassed traditional workstations for the first time in 1996, according to preliminary data from International Data Corp.
The market research firm said Wintel-based systems grew 38 percent worldwide to 831,000 units. With revenues rising 16 percent to $3.7 billion while sales of traditional Unix workstations declined, International Data said it expects Windows NT-based systems to continue gaining share in 1997.
Weisberg said he was concerned that Silicon Graphics, along with Sun Microsystems Inc., has chosen to shun Windows NT and adapt a Unix-only approach despite the fact many newer software developers favor Windows NT.
""Silicon Graphics is, in effect, eliminating some of the very good software vendors,"" he said. ""If they don't make some type of a move to support Windows NT by the end of the year, 1998 could be a very difficult year for Silicon Graphics.""
Drew Henry, product line manager of Silicon Graphics' power desktop line, said that with the design used in its O2, Indigo2 and Octane systems, Silicon Graphics can ""sell levels of performance that are well above levels of performance that you're going to get out of a Wintel system.""
About half of the new Octanes, which Silicon Graphics plans to start shipping by the beginning of March, are expected to be sold through third parties, he said.
International Data analyst Karen Seymour said the Octane's new design, or architecture, would give it ""headroom"" for future high-end performance and help it gain market share. But she said it was not likely to challenge the position of first-place Sun Microsystems and No. 2 Hewlett-Packard Co..
""I think the most critical aspect of this announcement is going to be SGI's ability to execute,"" she said.
Silicon Graphics last week said delays in stepping up production of new computer models hurt financial performance in its December quarter despite strong demand for new products which pushed its orders to record levels.
Pricing for the Octane systems starts at $24,995, the company said.
The new prices for Indigo2 machines, which take effect Feb. 1 and include up to a 33 percent reduction in memory and storage upgrade prices, reduce the price of its lower-end Indigo2 Solid Impact to $19,995 from $24.995.

4000,"The British government is unlikely to block U.S. group CE Electric's 650 pence per share bid for regional electricity company Northern Electric on competition grounds, industry sources said on Thursday.
But this view has not stopped concern that Trade Secretary Ian Lang might block the takeover for political reasons, dampening Northern's share price, they added.
Lang is widely expected to announce his decision by next Monday, December 16, and CE Electric has put a self-imposed deadline of December 20 on acceptances for its bid.
Northern's shares were down 3.5 pence at 598 pence by 1400 GMT, well below the 650 pence level to which CE Electric, which has already snapped up just under 30 percent of its target on the market, raised its original 630 pence offer on December 6.
""Logically, the bid should be cleared. If it does not go through, it will be for entirely political reasons,"" said one analyst who asked not to be identified.
Utilities have come under heavy public criticism over hefty executive pay packets, large shareholder dividends and spiralling takeover prices.
Approval of the Northern bid and for the less contentious agreed $2.15 billion offer by U.S. group Dominion Resources for East Midlands Electricity would leave just three independent regional electricity companies (Recs) out of an original 12.
East Midlands was due to report half-year results on Monday, but has postponed them until after the decision on Northern.
With the ruling Conservatives lagging the opposition Labour Party in polls and an election looming within five months, Lang might defer a potentially unpopular decision by a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC), analysts said.
""A referral to the MMC would delay a decision, possibly until after the next election, and if Lang thinks it is enough of a hot potato, he might do that,"" one analyst said.
CE Electric, 70 percent owned by CalEnergy, has said it is confident the bid ""has nothing but pro-competitive aspects.""
Northern's chairman David Morris, fighting for a higher bid, is also keen to see the offer approved as he felt the regulatory uncertainty was keeping the company's share price down.
Northern, which last year spent 560 million pounds ($924.7 million) to fight off a hostile bid from Trafalgar House, now part of Kvaerner, has consistently said the bid undervalues.
It has claimed a price of 700 pence per share was indicated in talks between the two firms before the bid was launched on October 28, but the Americans have denied such a price was discussed and analysts said although approval would see shares rising, it was unlikely Northern could secure a higher price.
""I would not think it will go much above 650 pence. Northern has promised dividend increases but investors may well opt for jam today instead of jam tomorrow,"" said one sector analyst.
Britain has already nodded through sales of seven of the 12 cash-rich Recs originally privatised, with three going to U.S. companies in a flurry of takeovers in the last two years.
But Lang shocked the market in April when he blocked bids by generators National Power and PowerGen for Recs Southern Electric and Midlands Electricity respectively, saying they might pose detriments to competition.
Analysts said Lang might opt to approve the bids with conditions, possibly calling for financial guarantees to assuage concerns over CE Electric's debt position, or he might call for ring-fencing of the regulated electricity supply business.
Analysts said approval for the current bids could open the floodgates for bids on the remaining Recs -- Southern, Yorkshire and London, which dropped talks with U.S. group Entergy only last month.
""Although there is not a clear, tight policy on these bids, I feel Lang will work more on logic than politics,"" the sector analyst said. ($1=.6056 Pound)

Britain's takeover panel was meeting Monday to consider an application by Northern and its advisers BZW to appeal the board's unusual decision to extend the bid. The panel extended the deadline on the 782 million British pound ($1.3 billion) bid from Dec. 20 until Dec. 24.
The panel extended the fiercely fought bid on Friday in what newspaper reports said was a reaction to BZW's initial failure to disclose an extra 250,000 pound ($417,000) fee related to its performance in the bid.
""Following the investigation, the executive will consider what, if any, further action is appropriate,"" the panel said in a brief statement.
BZW has denied any wrongdoing. A spokesman said, ""We have absolutely nothing to hide from an investigation and we expect to be fully exonerated.""
But asked whether the investigation may last into the New Year, the spokesman added: ""I would think so, yes.""
The panel noted it may also look into the acquisition by BZW and investment bank Schroders of 2.32 percent of Northern Electric's shares last week.
As the initial deadline expired, CE had obtained control of only 49.77 percent of Northern. But after the deadline was extended until Christmas Eve, CE notched that total up to 50.13 percent, a majority that would have given it victory.
But acceptances after the initial deadline require consent from the Takeover Panel. Northern is now fighting to appeal the extension to try to make the late acceptances null and void and to retain its independence.
""If the panel rejects the right to appeal, or the appeal fails, then Northern will be taken over. If the appeal committee says the panel was wrong to extend the bid, then Northern stays independent,"" said one analyst who declined to be identified.
At Newcastle-based Northern's request, dealing in its shares was temporarily suspended from Monday morning, standing at 638 pence ($10.68), pending the conclusion of the appeal process.
CE, which is 70 percent owned by Omaha-based CalEnergy, then complained to the panel last week about share purchases made by BZW and Schroders. The panel said there was nothing wrong with those share purchases but did rule out further buying by BZW and Schroders when it extended the deadline.
A BZW official told Reuters that the fee from Northern was not in any way linked to BZW buying of Northern shares.
Northern had fought hard to fend off CE Electric's 650 pence ($10.88) per share bid, which it claimed undervalued the company, promising a 17 percent rise in its final dividend and lower than expected debt.
CE Electric, which raised its original 630 pence ($10.55) offer on Dec. 6, maintained that it was offering a fair price and has already bought nearly 30 percent of Northern on the market. It has said it will hang on to that stake even if its bid fails, which analysts said could depress Northern's shares.
The bid is the second hostile takeover that Northern has faced -- it spent 560 million pounds ($933 million) fending off Trafalgar House, now owned by Norway's Kvaerner, last year.

4018,"British utility stocks rose on Friday on hopes for shareholder benefits after Southern Electric said it would make a complicated share buy back worth up to 156 million pounds ($252.8 million).
Analysts said Southern's move, which followed a similar Yorkshire Water plan announced on Thursday, could provide tax benefits and might bolster arguments against the opposition Labour Party's plans for a one-off levy on utilities.
Southern followed a trail blazed on Thursday by Yorkshire Water by offering a share consolidation which will give all holders free B shares.
It will then offer to buy back these shares at a fixed price, in Southern's case 60 pence per existing ordinary share.
Southern's shares were up 13 pence to 800-1/2 pence by early afternoon and other shares in the water and electricity sectors followed their lead, with South West gaining 10 pence to 672-1/2 pence and Anglian up 11-1/2 pence to 637 pence.
""All the utilities are up on the back of this, everyone is talking about buy-backs,"" said one trader.
Analysts said the moves by Southern and Yorkshire Water would decrease reserve capital and help the companies to avoid paying excess interest on Advanced Corporation Tax (ACT), which they can claim back from the government in two years' time.
The proposals are open to all shareholders and were seen by analysts as a tax-efficient way of returning value. At the same time, the measures will increase the level of debt for companies, which could provide a bolster to arguments against a one-off ""windfall"" tax proposed by Labour, analysts said.
Labour, which is ahead of the ruling Conservatives in polls before a general election due by May, has said it will impose a windfall levy on excess profits of utilities but has given no details of the tax's size or scope.
""Southern is gearing up ahead of an election, which might reduce its exposure to a windfall tax,"" the analyst said.
""A Labour government would find it hard to press them if they claimed there was no spare cash to pay the tax. I'm just surprised Southern has got rid of so little cash,"" the analyst added.
Other companies seen likely to pursue similar moves include Severn Trent, which is waiting to complete a 10 percent share repurchase after picking up 4.9 percent on the market and a small stake from the government in December last year.
South West has a mandate to buy back up to 10 percent of shares and finance director Ken Hill said when half year results were announced in November that the balance sheet was strong enough to handle such a move if appropriate.
Wessex Water announced a 10 percent buyback in December which attracted responses for around 3.2 percent and has also said it will buy around 87 percent of a 19.5 percent stake held by Waste Management International.
Analysts have also suggested Yorkshire Electricity, one of two independent regional electricity companies (Recs) along with Southern left after a spate of takeovers, might have funds for a buyback. ($1=.6172 Pound)

4023,"Dixons Group Plc became the latest British retailer to report a boost in Christmas sales on Wednesday but market watchers said there was no 1980s-style boom as discriminating buyers kept shops competitive.
""There isn't a big consumer boom but there is growth in the consumer economy,"" Dixons managing director John Clare told Reuters as the electronic goods firm reported sales up eight percent in the period over Christmas.
""There is certainly a return to the ""feel good' factor, but it isn't a return to the spend, spend, spend culture of the eighties,"" said Clive Vaughan, retail consultant at research group Verdict.
Analysts pointed out that as Christmas fell on a Wednesday in 1996, many shoppers left purchases to the last minute and retailers were likely to have seen a late flurry of buying.
At the same time, consumers are more discerning than in past years, preferring to pay for quality and investing in durables, which has favoured the higher end of the retail sector.
""Consumers are more discerning, so the high street is still very competitive on price and quality,"" said Hugh Clark of the British Retail Consortium, which represents over 90 percent of retailers and will release its December sales figures next week.
British money supply data released on Monday showed a higher than expected increase in December month-on-month figures, suggesting continuing buoyancy on the high street, analysts said.
Leading British department store Harrods, kicking off its January sale, said on Wednesday sales during the Christmas period were up 10 percent and two percent ahead of budget.
""It was a very strong, very consistent Christmas,"" said Michael Cole, Harrods director of public affairs.
On the Monday before Christmas, Harrods had sales of three million pounds ($5 million), compared with average daily intake of 1.2 to 1.5 million, he said, record Monday takings for the group.
Meanwhile, Merchant Retail Group said on Wednesday its specialist Perfume Shop chain saw same store sales soar 18.6 percent in the Christmas period.
Department store chain John Lewis said last week that sales in the week ending December 28 were up 8.8 percent on a year ago, while jewellers Goldsmiths said sales from existing stores jumped 9.8 percent in the Christmas period.
Aspreys, jewellers to the Royal Family, told a newspaper last week that Christmas sales had been ""substantially better than last year, a double-digit increase.""
Clothing retailer Next Plc is expected to report Christmas sales by mid-January but analysts pointed out that its strong brand image should bolster performance.
""Indications are that the polarisation of stronger versus weaker retailers continues,"" said Roy Maconochie, analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite. ""The consumer is more discriminating so stronger brands win out,""
Verdict's Vaughan said consumer demographics were also influencing product sales as the youthful buyers of the eighties become the more cautious over-30-year-old consumers of the nineties and have more disposable income. ($1=.5922 Pound)

4026,"British supermarket group Safeway Plc is currently seeing a zero inflation rate excluding petrol, deputy chairman David Webster told Reuters in an interview.
""Inflation excluding petrol is now probably zero,"" he said.
But Webster said the fall in prices was ""nothing to do with a price war.""  
Webster said he felt shoppers ""are pulling in their belts a little more than usual,"" and added he felt it was ""a sector issue.""
But he said he thought a price war remained ""very unlikely.""
Safeway said in a statement that price inflation had fallen in the early weeks of the new year from a modest 1.1 percent gain seen in the five weeks to January 4.
It said sales growth over the key Christmas trading period had been 5.2 percent but over the first 16 weeks of the second half that had slowed to a 4.5 percent gain.
""In the last four weeks the sector and Safeway have come off quite sharply in terms of overall sales performance,"" Webster said.
Safeway said in its statement that if current rates of sales growth and inflation continued, profits in the final eight weeks of its year, which ends in March, might be affected.
Webster said it was ""very hard to judge"" whether the slowdown in sales would continue. ""We continue to see significant deflation in produce, which is 10 percent of total sales,"" he said.
He declined to give details of the impact on margins, however.

4032,"U.S. group Entergy finally agreed a 1.267 billion pound ($2.11 billion) takeover of British regional electricity company (Rec) London Electricity on Wednesday, after talks between them were called off in November.
London's chairman Sir Bob Reid ""did an excellent job of extracting a generous price out of us,"" Entergy chairman and chief executive officer Ed Lupberger told Reuters.
Entergy and London, which supplies power to the capital and the City financial district, said in a joint statement that the bid valued London shares at 705 pence each and that shareholders would retain the right to receive a 14.3 pence interim dividend.
Reid said the offer ""represents fair value for London Electricity and is in the best interests of London Electricity's shareholders, customers and employees.""
London's shares leapt to a high of 690 pence but later eased back to be up three pence at 685 pence by 1135 GMT.
Lupberger declined to comment on the process leading up to the bid.
The two companies conceded in a statement in November that talks between them had broken down after the Wall Street Journal Europe reported that Entergy was considering a 1.2 billion pound bid at around 700 pence per share.
Entergy said Wednesday's offer, made through bid vehicle Entergy Power UK Plc, would ""create a partnership through which both companies can pool expertise and working practices to further improve operating efficiencies.""
Entergy joins two other U.S. companies which are currently pursuing Recs. Dominion Resources has agreed a $2.15 billion takeover of East Midlands Electricity and CalEnergy's CE Electric unit has made a hostile 650 pence per share bid for Northern which closes on Friday.
The floodgates for further bids in the sector were opened last Friday when the British government decided CalEnergy's bid, which the market had seen as more contentious than the agreed offer, could go ahead with some conditions.
Dominion's bid still awaits UK approval but analysts said there were no immediate reasons why this offer or Entergy's bid should be blocked after approval of CalEnergy's offer.
Entergy's bid sparked gains in shares of Yorkshire and Southern, the only two Recs which remain independent and currently unsolicited of the original 12 cash-rich Recs created at privatisation in 1990.
Yorkshire was up six pence to 765 pence on Wednesday morning while Southern gained four pence to 768.
Entergy's Lupberger said taking over London Electricity would enable the U.S. firm to ""build a new opportunity in the European marketplace.""
Reid said Entergy's plans to use London as a platform for expansion into Europe were particularly exciting, adding that the deal would offer opportunities all round.
Entergy said the bid would also enable it to ""gain experience for the development of its U.S. business after deregulation.""
Entergy, like many U.S. companies, sees the UK electricity supply sector as an attractive area to gain experience of deregulation and supply markets.
Entergy is based in New Orleans and has interests there in both generation and supply of electricity.

4035,"Troubled British stores group Sears Plc warned on Thursday that annual profits would fall below last year's levels and reported disappointing Christmas trading.
The news hit Sears shares and prompted analysts to say the group should be broken up.
""The corpse has clearly not responded to treatment and now they should do the decent thing, which is to break it up,"" said one analyst who asked not to be named.
Sears said in a statement that full-year pretax profits before exceptional items would be significantly below last year's 100.1 million pounds ($169 million) and added that Christmas same store sales slipped 0.5 percent from a year ago.
Shares, which had already fallen after The Guardian newspaper had said that profits would fall, closed down 4p, or 4.4 percent, at 87-1/2p after a low of 83.
Analysts said annual profit forecasts could now be trimmed back to around 80-90 million pounds from previous levels of around 110-120 million pounds.
But Sears's flagship London department store Selfridges performed well, with sales in the second half to January 6 up 8.6 percent, comparable with other retailers who have reported trading over the key Christmas period so far.
Clothing sales were also up, by eight percent in the period, with womenswear, which includes high street chains Wallis, Warehouse and Miss Selfridge, boosting sales by 14.3 percent.
But childrenswear saw turnover down four percent and footwear, Sears's persistent problem area, fell 2.8 percent at the start of the second half.
Sales at Sears's home shopping business Freemans slid 6.5 percent early in the second half and it said it expected to make an announcement soon on talks about selling the business to the privately-owned mail order-to-pools group Littlewoods.
Analysts have suggested that Freemans could be worth around 350 million pounds in such a deal, with some looking for a price of as much as 500 million.
""It is now all about the break-up value,"" said the analyst.
The company tried to ditch part of its British Shoe business last year but this was scuppered when the stores had to be taken back from retailer Facia after Facia's collapse in June 1996.
Analysts said Selfridges could be worth over 500 million pounds while a conservative valuation of one times turnover for the clothing business would mean a price of 600 million pounds.
""That means that the British Shoe business is seen by the market as a liability to the tune of around 200-300 million pounds,"" the analyst said.
He put a valuation of around 101-102 pence per share on Selfridges, the clothing business and the revenue from any sale of Freemans, around 19 percent above current share levels.
""I would hope they are going to do something radical, getting rid of British Shoe, even for a nominal sum, would free the company of that liability,"" the analyst said.
A flotation or sale of Selfridges is also seen as an option, or potentially a bid for the company although analysts said there were few likely buyers.
The company's poor performance could increase pressure for chief executive Liam Strong to quit, analysts said, after some five years at the helm trying to mend the group's fortunes.
Strong faced calls for his resignation in June from shareholders angry at the lack of progress in turning the sprawling retail business around. ($1=.5922 Pound)

4043,"CE Electric claimed 50.03 percent of British target Northern Electric in a fiercely fought bid on Saturday but, in an unusual twist, needs takeover panel approval on crucial extra acceptances to declare victory.
A spokesman for the U.S. company said additional acceptances were still being counted. CE Electric held 49.77 percent of the regional electricity company (Rec) by its own 1300 GMT deadline on December 20, just short of control, but in an unprecedented move the British takeover panel stepped in to extend final deadlines.  
The panel said late on Friday that the deadline for the 782 million pound ($1.30 billion) contentious offer had been extended to 1300 GMT on Christmas Eve and said any acceptances arriving after CE's Friday deadline must have its consent.
No one at the takeover panel was immediately available for comment, nor was Northern Electric.
The Financial Times newspaper said on Saturday that the extension of the deadlines suggested the panel felt shareholders had not been treated fairly in the last days of the 650 pence per share bid.
CE Electric said in a statement earlier on Saturday that the panel had ""prohibited Northern's advisers from purchasing Northern Electric shares at anytime prior to the close of CE Electric's final offers.""
The American energy group had complained to the takeover panel earlier this week over share buying by Northern's advisers, brokers BZW and Schroders, which it claimed was ""frustrating action"".
But the panel cleared the purchases, which amounted to 2.32 percent of Northern, late on Thursday.
It said in a statement then that at a hearing of the panel BZW and Schroders had ""accepted that there was no doubt about their intention -- it was to defeat the bid. However, they denied that there had been any breach of the code.""
The panel said such purchases have ""long been accepted.""
The bid, which was raised from an original 630 pence per share offer on December 6, has been hotly contested by Northern, which claims the price undervalues it.
Northern had claimed it had the backing of its largest institutional investor, the Prudential, which holds around 11 percent, as well as other funds including M&amp;G and Foreign &amp; Colonial.
But prior to Friday's deadline, CE Electric already held 30 percent of Northern, bought on the open market, and had previously declared acceptances which brought its holding up to around 34 percent.
Northern is the only one of the original 12 cash-rich Recs to have successfully fought off a takeover bid, spending 560 million pounds on shareholder benefits to fend off Trafalgar House, now part of Norway's Kvaerner, last year.
Nine of the 12 Recs have been sold or agreed to takeovers since they came up for grabs when the government's protective golden share expired in March 1995, just five years after privatisation.
If CE Electric wins control of Northern, only two of the original 12 Recs will remain independent -- Yorkshire and Southern.
Analysts see Yorkshire, which could carry a price tag of around 1.4 billion pounds, as the more vulnerable of the two, as Southern could cost a predator over two billion pounds and has firepower to mount a fierce defence.
American companies already own three Recs with two others in agreed takeovers, Dominion Resources with East Midlands and Entergy with London Electricity.
U.S. companies are hotly tipped as potential buyers for remaining Recs as they are attracted to the UK's friendly regulatory environment and see the country as a good English-speaking springboard into continental Europe.

4048,"U.S. utility group CE Electric upped the stakes in its hostile bid for British power company Northern Electric on Friday, raising its offer to a final 650 pence a share and setting a December 20 deadline.
But CE's hopes that Northern would recommend the raised 782 million pound ($1.29 billion) bid were dashed as Northern rejected the offer after carefull consideration.
CE Electric chairman David Sokol's said earlier he hoped Northern would recommend the bid after it was raised from 759 million pounds.
CE Electric, the bid vehicle for CalEnergy of the United States, said the new offer represented ""compelling value.""
""This is an overwhelmingly strong offer,"" Sokol said in an interview.
But Northern Electric chairman David Morris responded with a statement saying: ""CE Electric has failed to recognise Northern Electric's true value in its revised offer.""
""It (CE) has ignored the new information provided and it is still looking to buy Northern Electric too cheaply. Shareholders should reject this revised offer.""
CE Electric has already snapped up nearly 30 percent of its target as Northern's share price has languished under concerns that the British government would block the bid.
Trade and Industry Secretary Ian Lang is expected to decide by December 16 whether or not to refer the takeover to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) for review.
Northern's shares lost 1p to 600 pence by the close as the overall market slid by more than two percent.
""The latest offer probably still undervalues Northern but I think it will succeed...I think shareholders will (accept),"" said one analyst who asked not to be identified.
Northern rushed out half year results last week as part of its efforts to push up CE Electric's offer and said gearing should have fallen to 95 percent by March 1997 against earlier forecasts of 175 percent.
Northern has claimed that talks between the two companies before CE Electric launched its bid indicated a price of 700 pence per share but the Americans have consistently denied this.
Sokol said Northern had not produced any new information in its defence documents but added CE Electric had been holding back ""a certain amount of dollars"" in hopes of a recommendation.
""But given that Northern's board has not wanted to talk, we felt it was not fair to withhold the cash from shareholders,"" Sokol said.
He said the final deadline had been brought forward to December 20 from early January because it would give certainty to employees and shareholders ahead of the holiday season.
Northern, one of only a handful of independent power companies remaining, has called on the government to let the bid go ahead and made clear its only dispute with CE Electric is on price. ($1=.6082 Pound)

Retail investors and institutions began building positions reflecting the sentiment that Deng's death would actually benefit the markets in the longer term by removing a major negative factor, they said.
At the close on Friday, Shanghai's foreign currency B share index rose 0.894 points, or 1.38 percent, to 65.569 points while the domestic A share index closed at a year high of 1,063.276, rising 55.545 points, or 5.51 percent.
In Shenzhen, the B share index rose 7.43 points, or 5.18 percent, to 150.96 and the A share index zigzagged up 8.68 points, or 2.48 percent, to 359.28.
""Trading has returned to normal,"" said one Shanghai trader. ""Investors don't believe there will be any major policy change after Deng's death.""
""Some investors believe Deng's death will benefit the markets by removing a major negative factor for good,"" he said.
""The bad news has been digested,"" a Shenzhen-based analyst with Central-South Securities said. ""The Shanghai stock market performed well because investors can see a smooth leadership transition taking place.""
""People feel today that there is a stable political transition and the government is gaining credibility,"" another Shenzhen analyst said. ""Medium and long-term investors are beginning to pour in funds.""
Shanghai brokers said securities houses in the city convened meetings on Thursday which agreed on the necessity to keep the markets moving normally, but decided not to intervene to support the markets.
But some analysts said they suspected the markets were in one way or another receiving support from institutions under instructions to ensure no major market movements in the aftermath of Deng's death.
""I still think there may be some government support in this,"" said an analyst with a foreign brokerage in Shanghai. ""The official intention is to ensure that normalcy is maintained.""
Analysts said the relatively short mourning period before Deng's funeral on Tuesday indicated China wanted to dispel the gloom as quickly as possible, helping to creating favourable investment conditions.
""The stock markets in China are very sensitive to political conditions,"" said another Shanghai trader. ""The impression that China is on the right track towards a smooth transition has helped the markets to recover swiftly.""
Other brokers have warned that there was still potential for market volatility in the short term.

4070,"Key companies on China's foreign currency B share markets were expected to report slightly better results for 1996 after a dismal 1995, with more progress seen for 1997, analysts said on Monday.
The B share companies were generally lagging far behind the booming growth of China's economy, and gains in 1996 would be followed by a stronger performance in 1997 based on two interest rate cuts last year and sharply lower inflation, they said.
""We do expect things to get better, but it's not here yet,"" said Bruce Richardson, chief analyst for HG Asia in Shanghai. ""Market sentiment is quite strong, people see some hope.""
Shanghai property developer Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone Development Co Ltd, a key market barometer, expected 1996 post-tax profits of 590 million yuan, slightly up from the 585 million yuan in 1995, a company official said on Monday.
Other major companies including Shanghai Diesel Engine Co Ltd and Shanghai Tyre and Rubber also expected improved results in 1996 compared with 1995, officials said but declined to give details.
""The B share companies are expected to perform slightly better than in the past two years thanks to an improvement in the national economy,"" said Jiang Dengfu, a senior B share analyst with Shenyin &amp; Wanguo Securities.
""But improvements in the companies' results are lagging behind the better national economy. A full recovery is expected to start this year,"" he said.
Shanghai's B share firms posted a net year-on-year fall in profit of 13.8 percent in 1994 compared with 1993, and 16.3 percent in 1995 over 1994.
Analysts attributed the dismal results, when the Chinese economy as a whole was growing at more than 10 percent per year, largely to poor company management and Beijing's tight credit policy in force since mid-1993.
However, bank interest rate cuts in May and August last year were seen as having relieved much of the pressure.
""The firms began improving this year thanks to the bank interest rate cuts,"" said a second analyst. ""Key companies such as Lujiazui also won big loans from the government.""
Brokers in southern Shenzhen said they didn't expect a remarkable improvement in the 1996 results of locally-listed B share companies.
""But listed firms, especially those with heavy liabilities, may see their operations this year significantly helped by the lower rates because they will lead to lower finance-related costs,"" said one Shenzhen share analyst.
The exceptions would largely be firms that ignored the rules and traded heavily and successfully in their own shares, Shenzhen brokers said.
""Some public companies reaped huge profits from trading their own shares last year and part of the profits will be calculated into their 1996 profits,"" a broker with Shenzhen J &amp; A Securities Co Ltd said.
Not all analysts were optimistic of a turnaround in 1996 results.
""The results are going to be lousy on balance,"" said stock analyst Alex Conroy with ING-Barings in Shanghai. ""Very few if any of the companies will be able to pull off good results.""

4071,"Foreign companies are finally beginning to realise the dream of the China market that has long tantalized traders -- selling goods to the world's largest slice of mankind and making money from it.
Many foreign companies remain stuck in China ventures that are money-losing and frustrating, but the number turning a profit or at least gaining solid market share is increasing, along with the market, according to analysts and businessmen.
In the 16 or so years since China opened its doors to the global economy, the country has become the second-biggest recipient of foreign investment funds in the world, after the United States.
Foreign brands such as Coca-Cola, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Lux soap have become household names throughout China, and the shelves of convenience stores from Harbin to Hainan are stuffed with foreign-brand soaps, chocolates and cigarettes.
""Overall, more and more companies are coming, which is not necessarily to say they're making money yet,"" said a Western diplomat in Shanghai. ""But there's now a general view that there's not only great potential but also an increasingly good track record for companies that have persisted.""
""You can now see that if you stick it out, you can make money and you can get good market share. Coca-Cola is now a household name throughout China,"" he added.
Coca-Cola Co. came back to China after a 30-year absence in 1979, and the company booked its first accounting profit for its China operations 11 years later, said John Farrell, head of China operations.
""You cannot afford not to be in China. It's just the reality of opening a country of this size and the size of the economy and population,"" Farrell said.
""But it takes a lot of patience and you need to be very diligent to build your business. It's not easy by any means.""
The Atlanta-based company has 18 bottling plants across China, and with sales volume doubling every three years this is just the beginning.
Coca-Cola declines to say just how profitable the China market is. Like most other companies, it does not issue figures on its China operations.
""You have to march along with the constraints that you're given,"" Farrell said.
""The main thing for us was living up to the commitments we'd made on building plants, transferring technology and training people. The more we did that, the longer we did that, the more people would believe and trust us and allow us to expand a little bit more.""
Among the sectors that have done well so far are communications equipment firms, such as Motorola Inc. of Schaumberg, Ill., and Sweden's LM Ericsson AB, and low-priced consumer product makers.
""Generally speaking, the easiest place to make a profit tends to be in the consumer industry, usually fairly small-scale operations,"" said Anne Stevenson-Yang, director of China operations for the U.S.-China Business Council.
""That is, assuming the deal is done right,"" she added.
There are big variations on market access and ease of business for foreign companies depending on the sector they are trying to storm.
The restraints are few in areas such as consumer products, while in sectors such as banking, distribution and insurance, foreign firms are kept on a very tight leash.
Overall, companies involved in high-cost, long-term projects seem to bear a proportionately bigger risk, analysts said.
""Big, heavy industry projects are a problem,"" said one foreign broker in Shanghai.
""Generally, foreign businesses in trouble have a bad business plan, or they're doing things which China is not famous for -- like trying to build airplanes or something.""
The automobile industry has seen its share of troubles for foreign companies which have ventured in.
Chrysler Corp. had a famously difficult relationship when it set up a joint venture in Beijing in the early 1980s, and France's PSA Peugeot Citroen is looking at closing one of its two China plants.
""We're having some difficulties -- all Western carmarkers are having difficulties in China,"" said a Peugeot official in early December.
General Motors Corp., which has been close to completing negotiations for a $1 billion automobile factory in Shanghai for months, is well behind schedule on its plans and could have trouble ever making a profit in China, according to some analysts.
""It's going to be very difficult for them to make money. But they're coming in because they feel they have no choice,"" said the Western diplomat. ""It they don't do the deal, Ford will.""
Hong Kong and Taiwan businessman have generally done much better in their investments than non-Chinese, said a representative for a Hong Kong trading company in Shanghai.
""But more people make money than they would admit,"" he added. ""People find ways to shift profits to Hong Kong or from one company to another to make things look like break-even.""
Making money is not a top priority for many companies in the China market, at least in the initial stages. Many are happy to break even or lose money for many years in order to gain market share.
The Canadian insurance company Manulife Financial, for instance, which set up a joint venture last month, said it doesn't expect to see a profit for at least seven years.

4073,"China announced on Tuesday a preferential tax rate of 15 percent for foreign banks doing local yuan business but limited them to dealing with foreign-funded firms registered in Shanghai.
Foreign bankers expressed surprise at the rate, which is the same as that at which their foreign currency business is taxed, and much lower than the 33 percent rate for Chinese banks doing the same business with the same clients.
But bankers with local Chinese commercial banks said they were not worried about the decision, saying the scope of the local currency business that foreign banks would be allowed to conduct would be highly restrictive for years to come.
The official Xinhua news agency said in a report that the four foreign banks chosen by the People's Bank of China to do local currency deposit and loan business would be taxed at the same rate as their current foreign currency business.
""Their (foreign banks) income tax rate will remain the same, 15 percent as before,"" the agency said. ""Their clients can only be foreign-funded enterprises registered in the city, and they should open RMB (renminbi or yuan) accounts in the central bank's Shanghai branch,"" it added.
The four foreign banks are the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp, Citibank, Tokyo-Mitsubishi Bank and the Industrial Bank of Japan.
""It sounds too good to be true,"" said a banker with one of the four foreign banks chosen to begin yuan business. ""It's especially strange because many foreign bankers have at least implied that they would be willing to accept a higher tax rate. It's very surprising.""
A second foreign banker said the major restriction on the foreign banks would be local currency funding, especially given the ban on the banks taking on individual retail deposits in yuan.
""The key issue seems to be funding,"" he said. ""If the funding sources are limited you have no local currency to expand your business.""
All foreign banks in China are currently restricted to doing business in foreign currency and have been eager to gain a share of the huge local market for yuan deposits and loans.
""The announced tax is not going to greatly impact on our business in the short term,"" said an official with a major Chinese bank. ""Foreign banks are now restricted in the companies and location of their local currency business and further development is expected to be very slow.""
But another local banker said the opening of yuan business to foreign banks would inevitably put pressure on Chinese banks.
""In the past, competition has been only among ourselves and no matter whether our services are good or bad, we survive at the expense of depositors,"" the banker said. ""In the long run, we have to improve ourselves.""
Xinhua said that about 10 foreign banks had applied to the central People's Bank of China for the right to start yuan business.
According to rules issued by the central bank, foreign banks can only accept yuan deposits from foreign-funded firms or from foreign individuals or deposits from Chinese enterprises derived from the banks' loans to them.
The banks can supply yuan loans only to foreign-funded firms or Chinese enterprises who have previously obtained foreign currency loans from the banks, the rules said.

4080,"The city of Wenzhou, a capitalist pioneer in socialist China, has decided the best way to mourn paramount leader Deng Xiaoping is to make more money, residents said on Monday.
""Without Deng, there would be no today's China and, especially, no today's Wenzhou,"" said advertising company manager Wu Hao.
Deng, who died on Wednesday aged 92, helped to steer China on its current economic course, wrenching it from purist Marxist policies that had brought the nation to the brink of starvation and industrial collapse.
Once a poor and backward city, Wenzhou has boomed since Deng's reform were launched in 1979, seizing new opportunities more aggressively than almost any other place in the country.
While top-level attention focused on four ""special economic zones"" such as Hong Kong's neighbour Shenzhen, which was created as a closely-monitored official experiment with capitalism, Wenzhou just went ahead and started making money.
Private firms in the city of seven million people on China's eastern coast, 350 km (217 miles) south of Shanghai, now account for 75 percent of Wenzhou's annual industrial output, compared to a national average of 10 percent.
""There is no way we could make as much money as we do, do so much business, if it had not been for Deng Xiaoping and the policy changes he pushed through,"" Zhou Ping, the owner of a small shoe factory, said in a telephone interview.
Another businessman in his twenties, asked about Deng's death, said getting rich was his top priority.
""It (Deng's death) has nothing to do with my business,"" he said. ""What I should do is first make more money, then find a wife and finally have a son.""
""Despite any possible changes in Beijing, there will be less control of the private sector at least in the short term, and there will be more opportunities for making money,"" he added.
Wenzhou's brand of freewheeling capitalism was born of poverty and desperation.
The city sits on the coast facing Taiwan, home of the Nationalist government which in 1949 fled to the island, now regarded by Beijing as a renegade province, after losing the civil war.
Fearing a continuation of the war, the new communist government neglected coastal regions, including Wenzhou which for many years received less than half the level of state investment other cities did.
When Deng's reforms were launched, Wenzhou embraced them with fervour -- so much so that the city was criticised for following a capitalist road instead of a socialist one.
But Deng's 1992 visit to the south of China in which he called for fast development of the market economy silenced the critics and allowed Wenzhou to charge ahead, said a Wenzhou businessman who was formerly an official with a state-run firm.
""It gave us the courage to do business whole-heartedly without having to worry about the political consequences,"" he said.
Local officials say that with the policies on private enterprise and the market economy increasingly stable on a national scale, Wenzhou is set for a ""second surge of development"".
""This new surge is making Wenzhou's private firms even bigger and more competitive,"" said the former official.

4084,"A Chinese court sentenced a U.S. businessman on Monday to 10 years in jail for smuggling garbage, fined him 500,000 yuan ($60,000) and ordered him to be deported, the official Xinhua news agency said.
William Ping Chen had confessed to charges of smuggling banned goods, including 238 tonnes of garbage and a small amount of waste medical items, between July and December 1995, Xinhua said.
The Shanghai Number One People's Intermediate Court sentenced Chen to 10 years in jail and ordered his expulsion from China after finding him guilty of smuggling ""foreign garbage"" for profit, the news agency said.
Chen still has the right of appeal, but is likely to be deported swiftly if he waives that right.
""We place the highest priority on looking after U.S. citizens in this sort of situation,"" a U.S. consulate official said, adding that officials had requested permission to visit Chen in jail.
Chen, 56, who was arrested in June last year, was sentenced following an open hearing on December 2 at which he was defended by two lawyers, Xinhua said. The hearing was attended by an official from the U.S. consulate in Shanghai, it said.
Chen had insisted on going ahead with imports of banned waste items despite warnings from officials of the Shanghai municipal environmental protection bureau and the Chinese partners in his Shanghai United Paper Works Co Ltd, it said.
Chen had evaded customs supervision to illegally import the garbage from the United States and ""had caused serious damage to the environment of China"", the court verdict said.
The court also ordered Chen to pay the 500,000 yuan fine, Xinhua said.
Chen's arrest came during a furore in China over several illegal shipments of U.S. rubbish -- old clothes, rubber gloves, disposable syringes and medical nappies found mostly in shipments listed as waste paper for recycling -- and which escalated into an issue of national pride.
Chinese officials whipped up a nationalistic campaign over the garbage, with Shanghai customs describing itself as the ""front line, a steel Great Wall guarding the motherland"".
Last year, China turned back more than 200 ships from its ports carrying foreign waste or dangerous materials and issued new regulations to curb imports of foreign garbage.
The rubbish issue touched a nerve in China and also served as a timely tool for Beijing to wave in the face of U.S. attacks on its copyright violations and human rights record.
Chen's sentencing was the first in China of a U.S. citizen since human rights activist Harry Wu was detained in June 1995, convicted of spying and sentenced to 15 years in jail.
Wu was deported to the United States within hours of his sentencing after he decided not to appeal.
Four U.S. citizens are currently serving sentences in jails in China, but officials have declined to give details of the length of their terms or their offences.

4086,"China's entry to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) is likely to be one of the top issues for U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in Beijing as the two nations draw closer on trade issues, analysts said on Monday.
Albright, on the last stop of a nine-nation tour, will meet President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng and other officials during her brief stay, cut short because of funeral arrangements for the late leader Deng Xiaoping, who died last Wednesday.
Discussions on China's admission to the global trade body, long delayed by disagreements over the terms, have gained momentum in recent weeks with U.S. officials saying China has indicated a willingness to drop more of its trade barriers.
""It's going to be one of the main items on the agenda, they're right in the middle of it,"" said a Western analyst in Shanghai.
""What people want is for the Chinese to sign on to the international standards of trade. It would be a very positive factor in relations (between China and the United States) if it was resolved,"" the analyst said.
Zhou Dunren, professor at Fudan University's American Centre, said WTO entry was the biggest problem facing China and the United States in the sphere of economic relations.
""But it looks very possible that China will gain entry to the WTO this year, even though it may be a conditional entry rather than full membership,"" he said.
""The U.S. attitude on China's entry was previously very tough, setting very high conditions. But now there appears to be basic support from the U.S. to China's entry, with the conditions being softened somewhat,"" Zhou added.
""There's no doubt that the middle ground is appearing and that that's attractive to everyone,"" said John Crossman, Shanghai representative for financial firm Jardine Fleming.
""I think we can look forward to a time when trade disputes aren't what drives the China-U.S. relationship. Now the contact is all negative,"" he said.
China has been seeking to join the world body on the easier terms offered to developing countries.
But the United States and other Western countries say the Chinese economy is too big, and that giving it preferential treatment would distort the global trading system.
U.S. officials declined to comment on the current state of discussions on China's WTO entry.
Professor Peng Fuyong of Shanghai's Finance University said China's eagerness to gain WTO membership had also diminished somewhat in recent months.
""One reason for the slowdown may be concerns that there are certain elements of the domestic economic structure which are not ready for WTO entry,"" he said.
""For instance, the state-run import-export firms and some industries are not at this point efficient enough to face the competition that would result from WTO entry,"" Peng added.
Zhou said bilateral trade overall was set to continue to grow strongly in the years ahead.
""When the Shanghai Communique was signed 25 years ago (setting the framework for normalising Sino-U.S. relations), trade between the two amounted to probably just a few million dollars a year. It hit $50 billion in 1996, and it looks like this trend will continue,"" he said.
According to U.S. figures, China's trade surplus with the United States swelled to about $38.9 billion in 1996, up from about $34 billion in 1995. Beijing's figures show a net trade deficit with Washington.
The main reason for the widely varying figures is that China does not count goods shipped through the British colony of Hong Kong in its U.S. trade data.
""The return of Hong Kong to China in 1997 provides an opportunity for the two sides to find a solution to this problem,"" said Zhou.

4088,"China's decision to dramatically expand the number of companies listed on its B shares markets will help to finally make them a serious prospect for foreign investors, brokers said on Wednesday.
The securities authorities on Tuesday unveiled a list of 33 companies given approval to offer foreign currency B shares and list them on the two domestic stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen.
Last month, the authorities also named 38 companies for listing on overseas stock markets, most of which are expected to be listed as H shares in Hong Kong.
""They won't be able to list them all by the end of 1997, the volume is just too big,"" said Hoong Yik Luen of ING-Barings in Shanghai.
""But by mid-1998 if all goes well, the market capitalisation for B and H shares will be doubled or even tripled. Then the China market will become a serious market for international institutional investors,"" he said.
John Crossman, chief representative of brokers Jardine Fleming in Shanghai, said that while the quality of the companies proposed for listing was not yet clear, the plan to speed up listings was at least a step in the right direction.
""The only way for this market to go forward is for there to be a bunch of new listings, to get the B share markets up to 200-330 listings, and get capitalisation up to $20-30 billion, somewhere where people will pay attention to it,"" he said.
There are now 86 companies listed on the B share markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen, with total market capitalisation of about US$3 billion.
The new list, approved by the Securities Commission of the State Council (cabinet), includes refrigerator maker Qingdao Hai'er, Benxi Steel, Shenyang Petrochemical and Dalian Refrigerator.
The companies selected are mostly large state-run industrial enterprises from sectors including electric power, transport, electronics, telecommunications, petrochemicals, textiles, light industry and pharmaceuticals.
A local analyst with another foreign brokerage said the list of companies included no surprises and quite a few weak players.
""Bringing more companies to market is positive news but the companies have got to be good quality,"" he said. ""I'm personally not so satisfied with the candidates.""
The B shares, denominated in U.S. dollars in Shanghai and Hong Kong dollars in Shenzhen, are reserved for foreign investors, but a large proportion are held and traded by local Chinese investors operating through a variety of loopholes.
A spokesman for the Securities Commission was quoted as reaffirming the ban on local investors from holding B shares.
""I think people are saying it because it's the rules and the rules are to be respected,"" said a foreign brokerage analyst. ""But I don't think there will be vigorous enforcement.""

The single most sensitive and volatile factor for the markets in and around China in recent years had been the health of Deng.
Suddenly, it's not there any more.
""The official announcement has finally removed the main disturbing factor in the markets for the past few years,"" said a Hong Kong stock analyst based in Shanghai.
""It's the start of a new era. The new focal point of concern will hopefully be more economic fundamentals,"" the analyst said.
Local Chinese brokers agreed that Deng's death late on Wednesday removed a key negative factor from the markets.
""His health has long loomed large on the markets,"" said one stock analyst in Shanghai.
Bruce Richardson, Shanghai representative of HG Asia, said traders were relieved the wait was over.

""It shows that people are taking a forward-looking attitude. sentiment is very positive all around,"" he added.
Stock markets in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan moved higher on Thursday after gyrating wildly at the opening after the news.
Hong Kong stocks had jumped 1.96 percent or 256.96 points, by midday after an initial loss of 92 points. The weighted index in Taiwan rebounded from an earlier fall to close 21.19 points, or 0.28 percent, higher at 7,678.04.

4091,"China named on Thursday four more foreign banks approved to handle local currency business, and bankers said they saw the accelerated timetable reflecting a desire to boost property prices in Shanghai's Pudong zone.
The China Daily said the four new banks were U.K.-based Standard Chartered Bank, Japan's Sanwa Bank and Daiichi Kangyo Bank and the Shanghai-Paris International Bank, a joint venture between France's Banque National de Paris and the Industrial and Commerical Bank of China.
The newspaper said the banks, and four others named earlier, would be able to take deposits and make loans in yuan, the Chinese currency, only after they had moved operations to the Pudong district of Shanghai.
""I see the whole thing as being real-estate driven,"" said a foreign banker. ""To make Pudong a success, they need to get the foreigners over there, so there's no reason limiting the numbers.""
The Chinese authorities want to make the Pudong development zone in eastern Shanghai the country's premier financial district, and have told foreign banks they will only be allowed to do local currency business from offices there.
""Before the banks were approved no one would touch Pudong, but now people are charging over there to try and sign something up,"" said a real estate broker.
Foreign bankers had originally assumed the authorities would wait until the first four banks had begun operations before approving any more.
The first four are Citicorp's Citibank unit, HSBC Corp's Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp unit, the Industrial Bank of Japan and the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd
Chinese banking sources said a number of other banks would also be approved for yuan business during 1997.
Foreign bankers said the faster they were allowed into the yuan business the better, regardless of the limitations placed upon them.
Approved banks can only accept Chinese yuan deposits from foreign-funded firms or from foreign individuals, or deposits from Chinese enterprises derived from the banks' loans to them.
The banks can supply yuan loans only to foreign-funded firms or Chinese enterprises who have previously obtained foreign currency loans from the banks.
""We won't be able to increase our customer base, but it's at least a start, another step forward,"" said a foreign banker.
""It's a very significant step,"" said a senior banker with one of the chosen banks. ""If a bank can't do business in the local currency then it's only half a bank.""
""We welcome this good news,"" said Lance Browne, Standard Chartered's chief executive for China. ""It's a positive development for our business in China.""
Another banker said specific regulations for the business had not yet been issued by the central bank, and training sessions for foreign bank staff were in progress nearly every weekend.

4093,"Foreign business people said on Friday they expected Deng Xiaoping's death to have almost no affect at all on either economic policies or the immense problems they face in making money in China.
Analysts said foreign money had now become an indispensible part of the government's efforts to keep unemployment down and the economy growing, and there was no prospect of any fundamental shift.
Lance Browne, Standard Chartered Bank's China manager, said he expected no change in policy toward foreign banks, nor in the speed and extent to which they can expand their business in China.
""It could hardly be any slower, and speeding it up, that's unlikely too,"" he said.
""Business people at this point see virtually no impact on their operations, either with regard to policy or the problems they face,"" said a Western diplomat in Shanghai.
Foreign businesses have been placed under ever-greater profit pressure in the past year as various preferential policies applied previously have been cut back or abolished to give domestic companies greater room to manoeuvre.
""There could be a further tightening of policy on the privileges applied, but that was going on before and has nothing to do with the death of Deng,"" the diplomat said.
Deng, China's paramount leader, died late on Wednesday aged 92.
An American businessman in the automobile sector in Shanghai said he saw no impact from Deng's death, but reported an increasing sense of concern among foreign business about the problems of getting approvals and making a profit in China.
""People are investing heavily, but there is a great sense of disappointment and unhappiness,"" he said.
""This has nothing to do with Deng, but it will be important to see how the leadership absorbs this,"" he said.
Hoong Yik Luen, investment analyst with ING-Barings in Shanghai, said foreign funds had become a key part of government efforts to keep the economy growing and unemployment down.
""They wouldn't be able to change the policy on foreign investment, they couldn't afford it,"" he said. ""Unemployment would probably be 20 percent now instead of 15 percent if it wasn't for foreign investment.""
An investment analyst based in Hong Kong said major foreign corporations were committed to investing in China almost regardless of what happens.
""The fact that there has been almost no impact on investment flows from the roll-back on the preferential policies shows how much momentum investment has, and there's no reason for the Chinese to shift their policy on taking in money,"" the analyst said.
""I see no change at all in the short term,"" said Standard Chartered's Lance Browne.
""There hasn't been a sense that the reforms are controversial inside the leadership for years. Had it been controversial, it would be different,"" he said.
But Chinese officials appear to be concerned about the topic.
One foreign businessman said he had been visited by officials asking for his view on the possible impact of Deng's death on foreign investment in the country.
""They are asking the same questions you are asking -- what effect Deng's death will have on investment decisions,"" the businessman, who declined to be named, said.
""I told them the feeling was that there would be no effect,"" he added.

4097,"Shanghai's port will be expanded to improve container handling and the approach channels will be deepened to accommodate large container ships, the port director said on Friday.
The port's container throughput rose 29 percent to 1.97 million units last year and should rise by a further 21 percent to 2.3 million units this year, director Du Deming said.
""The aim is to reach three million units by the end of the century but we could surpass that, we are doing the preparatory work to meet this challenge,"" Du said in an interview.
Shanghai port, China's largest, has been hampered for more than a century by shallow approach channels and silt build-up from the Yangtze River. Despite continual dredging the approches are only seven metres deep.
""We need to deepen the approaches by five metres, through a combination of engineering and dredging, to bring the depth of the approaches to 12.5 metres,"" Du said.
""The plan is to achieve this within the next 10 years. It will be a big project with several phases,"" he added.
Du declined to estimate the amount of investment required to achieve the plan, saying it was under study.
""Water depth is one of our biggest problems. We need to deepen the approaches as soon as possible to allow in the third-, fourth- and even fifth-generation container ships which can hold 5,000 containers and more,"" Du said.
Fifth-generation container vessels have visited Shanghai, but never fully loaded.
Du said investment in new facilities and reconstruction in Shanghai port would drop somewhat this year below last year's 1.1 billion yuan ($132 million), but that investment would resume growing in 1998. He declined to give details.
He said the port was trying to improve efficiency and had brought average ship turn-around times down to two days last year, a 10 percent improvement over 1995.
""We are inevitably competing for business with other ports in the region, and ship owners and cargo owners can make their own choice,"" he said. ""We need to improve facilities, equipment and particularly information systems.""
But Du said he did not see Shanghai port as competing with Hong Kong, which last year handled 13 million standard containers, more than six times the throughput of Shanghai.
""There is not much conflict. China is such a big country that both ports can continue to be prosperous. Hong Kong basically handles the south of the country, and Shanghai the Yangtze basin,"" he said.
Development of the deep-water port of Ningbo port 200 km (125 miles) south of Shanghai has often been tipped as the answer to the port congestion and silting that dog Shanghai, but Du was cautious on the issue.
""We're looking into it,"" he said. ""Shanghai and Ningbo should both be developed, there is not enough capacity in either to meet the demand.""

4101,"The French government said on Tuesday it was ready to relaunch the privatisation of defence electronics firm Thomson-CSF and appointed key executives to oversee the sale.
""The government has just taken the decisions necessary for the privatisation of Thomson-CSF to enter the operational phase,"" the industry and finance ministries said in a joint statement.
An attempt to sell the whole Thomson electronics group last year floundered when the independent Privatisation Commission rejected the sale of parent company Thomson SA to the missiles-to-publishing conglomerate Lagardere Groupe for a symbolic one franc.
The government said on Tuesday it would make Marcel Roulet, formerly chairman of both Thomson SA and Thomson-CSF, responsible for the sale of the defence subsidiary on a full-time basis. He will now only be chairman of Thomson-CSF.
It also appointed Thierry Breton, formerly a deputy chairman of French computer maker Cie des Machines Bull, as chairman of Thomson SA and its wholly-owned consumer electronics unit, Thomson Multimedia (TMM).
Breton will be responsible for privatising TMM and will shortly make proposals on the sale, the statement said.
""First of all, it is the signal that the two things are really separate, with two different men who will exclusively work on Thomson-CSF and the handling of the privatisation of TMM,"" an industry ministry official said.
""The second signal is that, effectively, we are relaunching the TMM privatisation with a new head who will soon make proposals to the government on the procedure,"" he added.
The government will inject 11 billion francs ($1.9 billion) of fresh capital into TMM by the summer, following approval from the European Commission.
TMM, which makes television sets and video cassette recorders, will be sold gradually through an opening up of its capital, the statement said.
A source close the deal said the TMM sale would follow the lines of the past Bull privatisation -- a trade sale accompanied by a list of conditions, rather than a stock market flotation.
TMM would need sound finances to float on the bourse but is losing money and requires industrial partners who would take a medium-term view rather than stock market investors, who look to the short term, the source said.
An industry source said the boards of Thomson SA and Thomson-CSF met on Tuesday morning to discuss the terms and conditions of Thomson-CSF's privatisation.
A key objection by the Privatisation Commission to the government's first sale attempt was the planned sale by Lagardere of loss-making TMM to the South Korean Daewoo Electronics group, again for one symbolic franc.
Lagardere wanted to retain Thomson-CSF and merge its Matra Defense Espace unit with Thomson to create an integrated defence company with radar, satellite and missile interests.
The government has now decided to sell Thomson-CSF, 58 percent owned by Thomson SA, separately from TMM.
Detailed terms and conditions are expected to be announced shortly, opening the way for companies to make fresh bids for Thomson-CSF. Both Lagardere and Alcatel Alsthom have said they are interested.
TMM last week posted a 1996 net attributable loss of 3.1 billion francs, which included hefty provisions for factory closures and the expected loss of up to 10,000 jobs.
But it expects to break even at the operating level next year and be profitable from 1999 when U.S. patent revenues come on stream.
Thomson-CSF announced last week it returned to profit in 1996 after three years of losses, showing a net attributable profit of 745 million francs.

4106,"Holding company Cie de Suez  and utility Lyonnaise des Eaux must tell shareholders how they will benefit from the groups' planned merger, otherwise the deal will look like a defensive move, analysts said on Friday.
The boards of Suez and Lyonnaise are expected to approve later on Friday terms of the merger which will create a group with annual sales of about 200 billion francs ($35 billion) and a market capitalisation of 75 billion.
But size is not necessarily a bonus if the new group cannot bring operating companies together and if Suez is not allowed to sell Belgian financial assets to shed its conglomerate status and focus on utilities.
""If there is no link-up between Lyonnaise and Suez, the merger makes little sense. It looks like a defensive move,"" a share analyst said.
Lyonnaise chairman Jerome Monod told Europe 1 radio on Friday that the new group would have four core businesses -- energy, water distribution, waste management and communications.
""What do shareholders stand to gain?"" a second analyst asked. ""There is still uncertainty,"" he added.
In the short term, Suez shareholders can look forward to  a big cash payout as part of the merger terms, with a dividend estimated at around 24 francs per share, or a total of some 3.8 billion francs.
They are also getting a chance to cut the discount on Suez shares compared with underlying assets -- if the new group buries Suez's holding company image by selling financial assets to concentrate on utilities, as promised.
Suez investors will also gain by getting shares in Lyonnaise, which for all its past weakness, is one of France's biggest companies and harbours big expansion ambitions.
But Suez holders still need to be convinced on big issues related to the merger.
The merger is being structured as a Lyonnaise takeover of Suez, apparently to take advantage of Suez's tax loss carry-forward, which would shelter future profits of the new group. ""This needs to be clarified,"" said an analyst.
For Lyonnaise shareholders, the deal looks more risky.
They do not know if Suez chairman Gerard Mestrallet has made guarantees of management freedom to the Belgian government for the Societe Generale de Belgique holding company, which groups choice industrial and financial assets.
Any commitments may inhibit SGB's disposal of Belgian financial assets, which include stakes in banking giant Generale de Banque and insurer Fortis.
French investment in Belgium has become a sensitive issue since Renault SA's decision to close its Vilvoorde plant near Brussels at heavy cost to jobs.
The Belgian authorities insist on keeping the Tractebel utilities company, 50.3 percent owned by SGB, independent and headquartered in Belgium. This may limit the scope for integrating Tractebel into Lyonnaise's global ambitions.
Howver, Tractebel could benefit from asset transfers from Lyonnaise, such as the Elyo energy subsidiary.
The disposal of Suez's French financial units such as consumer credit house Sofinco, property broker Banque Monod and insurer Henin Vie, pose less of a problem.

4113,"Holding company Cie de Suez  and utilities group Lyonnaise des Eaux SA are expected to announce a merger deal on Friday, effectively ending the independence of the company created in the 19th century to build the Suez Canal.
The boards of the two companies will meet on Friday to approve terms of the link-up, which has already received the backing of the Lyonnaise board.
Lyonnaise chairman Jerome Monod said last Thursday that the merger with Suez was an excellent plan but the terms had not yet been fixed.
However, a source close to the merger talks told Reuters on Thursday that the share parity to be used would be 41 Suez shares for every 20 Lyonnaise shares.
Suez stock was down 0.04 percent at 282.90 francs ($48.79) on volume of 171,495 shares, while Lyonnaise was down 0.37 percent at 540. The market was off 0.63 percent.
Suez would also pay out either 3.6 or 3.8 billion francs for the 1996 dividend, the source added.
The deal would mark the end of autonomy for Suez, which fell victim in the 1990s to a troubled property market.
It was founded in 1858 by Ferdinand de Lesseps to build and operate the property asset which symbolised the glory of the French Empire and engineering, the Suez Canal.
Discontented Suez shareholders forced out the previous chairman, Gerard Worms, after the group reported a four billion franc ($690 million at current rates) loss in 1995 and installed Gerard Mestrallet to turn round the sprawling conglomerate.
Mestrallet quickly sold crown jewels such as investment bank Banque Indosuez and fund manager Gartmore. The ailing real estate portfolio was also disposed of, leaving Suez with more than five billion francs in cash.
But he held on to a 63 percent stake in Belgian holding company Societe Generale de Belgique (SGB) which groups some choice industrial and financial assets.
SGB welcomed Suez as a white knight in the late 1980s when it was being stalked by Italian businessman Carlo de Benedetti, who saw it as ripe for takeover.
Now it looks as if SGB could be the saviour for Suez. Stock market analysts say that if there is any industrial logic in the merger, it lies in Mestrallet's focus on the utilities sector and abandoning financial services.
SGB has a 37 percent stake in Tractebel, which specialises in electricity, gas, water and environmental services. It has operations in cable television, property, infrastructure and industrial installations -- areas which overlap with Lyonnaise.
Lyonnaise, under veteran chairman Monod, has set its sights on international expansion in utilities but lacks the financial muscle to fund that growth.
A link-up would inject fresh capital from Suez's cash hoard -- even after the special dividend to sweeten Suez shareholders on the merger.
Monod said last week that a merged Suez/Lyonnaise would be a multi-service company on a global scale and capable of boosting profits and cashflow.
Monod said earlier this week, he expected Mestrallet to head the executive board of the merged company while Monod himself would head the supervisory board and handle strategy. ($ = 5.797 French Francs)

4114,"Labour unions at beleaguered French carmaker Renault SA said on Monday that they were calling for a one-hour strike at all Renault plants in France, Belgium and Spain.
This was in reaction to an announcement last week that of Renault's Vilvoorde plant near Brussels would close and reports that job will go in France, they said in a statement.
Earlier a Renault spokeswoman said chairman Louis Schweitzer had agreed to meet staff this week at the Belgian plant, where 3,100 jobs will go, but the time and place were not set.
Last Thursday's surprise announcement by the privatised car firm that it would close Vilvoorde stirred a political storm at home and abroad, and a denunciation from Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene.
The Renault spokeswoman had no comment on newspaper reports that it was preparing to announce some 3,000 job cuts in France this year. But an industry source said somewhat fewer than 3,000 posts would go in 1997.
An official with the CGT union said Schweitzer was also expected to make a rare appearance at a staff works meeting in France on Thursday.
""Schweitzer has let it be known that he'll explain the situation the company finds itself in on Thursday at an extraordinary staff works council meeting,"" the official with the Communist-led CGT, Renault's biggest union, told Reuters.
Renault's troubles were highlighted by statistics showing new car sales in France slid 24.6 percent last month after tumbling 33.6 percent in January.
The two-month drop reflected the market's weakness since a French state rebate programme, which had underpinned demand, ended in September.
Faced with declining demand and gross overcapacity, Renault is being forced to cut production but must do so without French government support.
With French unemployment at 12.7 percent and a general election due next year, the centre-right government of Prime Minister Alain Juppe has refused to back a plan to cut 40,000 jobs in the car industry over six years.
French radio and newspapers gave blanket coverage to the labour dispute, with Le Figaro newspaper quoting the economy minister for Belgium's Flemish region as saying the closure was ""an act of economic terrorism"".
Thousands of workers from Renault Belgium, supported by steelworkers, marched through Brussels to protest against the shutdown which is expected to save 825 million French francs ($144 million) a year. Belgian workers called for a Renault boycott.
But on the French stock market, brokers said the company had to reduce output and restructure. Renault stock was down 4.02 percent at 141 francs at 1243 GMT, but that was due to profit-taking as the shares have risen 20 percent since last Wednesday.
""The big problem in the auto sector is overcapacity, a problem which no-one has dared to touch for 20 years for obvious labour reasons,"" said a broker. ""The fact that Renault is tackling it is a good sign.""
Renault shed 1,641 jobs last year and 1,735 in 1995.
Newspapers said charges for the job-cutting plans, on top of an operating loss at the group estimated at two billion francs or more, would result in a full year loss of more than five billion francs for the group in 1996.
The car firm was privatised in stages in 1994 and 1996.
Renault has four assembly plants in France, two in Spain, one in Portugal and one in Slovenia.

4123,"French defence electronics company Thomson-CSF, soon to be sold by the state, Wednesday posted 1996 results that showed a return to profit after three years of heavy losses.
Thomson-CSF reported net profit of 745 million francs ($129 million) compared with a net loss of 791 million ($137 million) for 1995. Sales were up 2.2 percent at 36.27 billion ($6.3 billion).
The government, after a bungled first attempt, is trying to privatise Thomson-CSF as part of a defence industry restructuring that could have an impact on the entire European sector.
French engineering and telecommunications giant Alcatel Alsthom has teamed up with aircraft maker Dassault Aviation and state-owned Aerospatiale to bid for Thomson-CSF. Lagardere, involved in businesses ranging from missiles to publishing, is also bidding, supported by British Aerospace Plc.
Thomson-CSF said its operating profit rose 5.6 percent to 2.07 billion francs ($358 million) despite a reduction in military budgets and tougher markets. The improvement was due to better competitiveness following restructuring efforts pursued over a number of years.
The net result was dented by an exceptional charge of 824 million francs ($143 million), compared with 753 million ($130 million) in the prior year, to cover restructuring costs tied to the shrinking of markets and cost-cutting measures, it said.
Consolidated pretax profit was 1.30 billion francs ($225 million), versus a loss of 437 million ($76 million), which included a 101 million franc ($17.5 million) hit from its the sale of its holding in the troubled state-owned bank Credit Lyonnais.
Thomson-CSF's previous three years' losses were essentially due to falls in the value of Credit Lyonnais' shares, which were taken on Thomson-CSF's accounts to reflect its equity stake.
Europe, excluding France, contributed more than 10 billion francs ($1.7 billion) in sales for the first time, compared with less than four billion ($692 million) in 1995.
""The European market accounts for 28 percent of the consolidated turnover, against only 10 percent at the end of the 1980s,"" it said, adding this was due to its policy of external growth through acquisitions.
Its holding in profitable semiconductor maker SGS-Thomson contributed 588 million francs ($102 million), up from 477 million ($83 million) in 1995.
Net debt fell to 900 million ($156 million) from 2.3 billion ($398 million).

4129,"Troubled Eurotunnel SA/Plc releases first-half results on Monday but analysts contacted by Reuters said any attempt to forecast the figures was futile, given the uncertainties overhanging its debt restructuring.
""Everything depends on resolving the financial situation. If they announce a good figure...that might help, but it's really a face-off between the company and the bankers,"" Olivier Machou, analyst at brokerage Leven said.
It was hard to forecast results due to ""dumping"" in Eurotunnel's bitter price war with the ferries, he added.
One analyst said, ""It's not a stock that you can take a view based on half-year figures, especially as the first half comes before the summer season.""
A London-based broker said, ""It's not worth forecasting, everything hangs on the debt talks, which will take forever. It will happen when it happens.""
However, one analyst at a large French brokerage said he had a rough forecast of a 2.5 billion franc net loss and an operating loss of around 100 million.
Eurotunnel needs to agree a refinancing of its bank debt by the end of September, having asked in July for two court-appointed mediators to stay on to negotiate a deal with its some 220-strong bank syndicate.
The Channel Tunnel operator posted first-half sales of 1.79 billion francs, up from 806 million a year ago.
It made a net loss for full-year 1995 of 7.196 billion francs on turnover of 2.266 billion.
The headline figures will likely be flattered by the fact that Eurotunnel did not have all its services running a year ago, said Jeff Summers, head of research at debt specialist Klesch and Co in London.
Stripping out the minimum usage fee that the railway operators pay, he expected a 25-30 percent improvement in the underlying results from a year ago.
In sterling terms, Summers has pencilled in a 22 million pretax, pre-interest loss versus 121 million a year ago. With benign currency movements, it may break even.
Operating cashflow should at least double to 56 million stg before interest and capital expenditure, compared to 29 million.
""Everything is going in its favour,"" Summers said. He cited the British government's recent decision to allow cooperation between ferry companies to pool their capacity and the European Commission's decision not to extend the duty-free sales regime beyond 1999.
Pooling by rivals such as P&amp;O and Stena would lead to ""a reduction in direct competition"" for Eurotunnel, while the loss of duty-free sales, representing 250 million stg of soft subsidies for the ferries, would push ferry firms to raise ticket prices.
Eurotunnel could then raise its prices and boost turnover.
The cross-Channel market has also grown much faster even than Eurotunnel forecast, with traffic up 20 percent last year and estimated growth of 13-15 percent this year, Summers said.
Moreover, Richard Branson, head of the London &amp; Continental Railways (LCR) group which runs the Eurostar high-speed train concession, has forecast it will hit six million passengers in the financial year 1996/97 and 10 million in 18 months.
If that happens, Eurotunnel could receive revenues above the minimum usage fee as higher service levels trigger extra payments.

4144,"Eurotunnel, operator of the Channel Tunnel, admitted on Thursday it took too long to get people off a blazing train last November but insisted that the fire was not its fault.
""Our service was safe in that we got everybody out of that train without serious injury in an extremely serious fire,"" Eurotunnel co-chairman Robert Malpas said.
""It took too long. They were in that club car too long,"" Malpas told a news conference at the French end of the tunnel.
Thirty-four people were slightly injured in the November 18 blaze, in which a train carrying a truck in flames tried to drive out of the tunnel quickly but broke down before it could.
The injuries occurred when smoke from the burning truck filled the tunnel and seeped into the club car where the truck drivers and other passengers were travelling.
Eurotunnel officials were criticised for delays in evacuating the passengers into a central service tunnel which runs between the two rail tunnels.
At Thursday's news conference, Eurotunnel officials unveiled a package of new safety measures and procedures which reversed a key element of its previous safety policy.
Under the new procedures, in the event of an emergency, passengers will be taken immediately off the train and into the nearest of 600 emergency cross-tunnel passages leading to the service tunnel.
""The most important policy change is that it (a train) will no longer drive through. The instruction will be to stop and get people out straightaway, whereas before it was to drive through -- and if it had to stop, to uncouple the club car,"" Malpas said.
French judicial authorities are still investigating the exact cause of the fire, which broke out on a truck-carrying shuttle train and severely hit Eurotunnel's passenger and freight services between Britain and France.
No lives were lost in the blaze.
Procedural changes would include more systematic checks on trucks at the time of loading, better surveillance of departing shuttles and more direct contact with the railway control centre, Eurotunnel said.
It also planned to install additional fire suppression systems in the rail tunnels by 1999.
Eurotunnel said it expected to re-open heavy goods vehicles (HGV) shuttle services before the middle of June and complete repairs on the south tunnel by mid-May.
""The changes we have announced today will make the system even safer and give us the confidence to re-open our HGV shuttle services,"" co-chairmen Malpas and Patrick Ponsolle said in a statement.
Eurotunnel said traffic carried in March by the Le Shuttle tourist service dipped to 153,796 vehicles, including coaches, from some 158,494 a year earlier, though there were only two departures an hour compared to the normal four departures an hour before the fire.
""These figures are close to those for March 1996, so are very satisfactory, particularly taking into account the fact that our capacity has been reduced by half due to the repair works currently being carried out in the tunnel,"" it said.
While Le Shuttle results fell, traffic on the high-speed Eurostar passenger train service shot up to 500,899 passengers in March from 389,069 in the year-ago period.
The amount of rail freight transported also rose, increasing to 230,753 tonnes from 207,417 in March 1996.

4150,"Port arrivals of 1996/97 Ivorian cocoa totalled around 1.02-03 million tonnes by May 12, down from 1.11 million by that date in the record 1995/96 year, port sources said on Tuesday.
Weekly arrivals at Abidjan and Ivory Coast's second port, San Pedro, dropped sharply to 5,000 tonnes in the week to May 12 from about 50,000 during the final week of the main crop (Oct-April), raising concern that the size of the May-September mid-crop would be disappointing.
""The mid-crop has been weak so far but we are still optimistic,"" said one Abidjan-based crop analyst. ""Some people thought it was going to be a bit late but we are optimistic as July and August will be the most important time (for arrivals).""
Ivory Coast's main crop totalled around 1.04 million tonnes by its April 27 close, against about 1.06 million tonnes in 1995/96 when a larger than expected mid-crop of just under 200,000 tonnes took that year's total to a record of around 1.2 million tonnes.
Early forecasts of Ivory Coast's 1996/97 crop proved to be cautious as arrivals by the end of the main crop had exceeded Ivory Coast's official full-year (Oct-Sept) forecast of up to 950,000 tonnes.
The 1996/97 crop is not expected by local crop analysts to set a new record but it will not be far behind if early private mid-crop forecasts of 150-180,000 tonnes prove to be correct.
""We are still fairly optimistic. Our figure is at the higher end of that range but we may cut by just a little,"" said the crop analyst.
Other crop analysts said recent talk of a mid-crop as small as 80,000 tones had been based on weak May and early June arrivals and signs of poor bean quality and sizes.
""What was around was small but I think it (bean quality) has improved,"" said one analyst. ""It should now be possible to get beans of 105 to 110 (beans per 100 grams).""
Ivory Coast's export grade standard of 105 beans per 100 grams sometimes eludes exporters during the mid-crop, when bean sizes usually decline along with harvest volumes. Exporters last year were surprised by high bean quality well into the mid-crop period.
Export quality inspectors have reported bean sizes in a 105-110 range with little evidence of humidity problems.
Torrential rains since mid-May have not raised bean humidity levels above the eight percent permitted for export grades. Farmers had problems drying main crop beans during heavy December rains, leading to some quality problems at port.
Crop analysts also report favourable signs for next year's 1997/98 main cocoa crop, but add that no reliable indication for the first half of that year would appear on trees until late July.
""We are only looking at the very beginning and it looks fairly good,"" said one. ""Nothing untoward has happened and rumours of a disastrous crop are probably wishful thinking. No one is yet in a position to know.""

4151,"Ivory Coast's cocoa mid-crop (May-Sept) could match harvest forecasts of over 150,000 tonnes but bean sizes are seen down from the record 1995/96 season (Oct-Sept), crop analysts and exporters said on Thursday.
""The development seems to be coming along quite nicely,"" said one. ""It is still early but I see no reason to suspect the mid-crop will be poor.""
Good peak wet season rains in June would decide the final mid-crop tally but this year's bean sizes are not expected to match the mainly exportable grades (105 beans per 100 grammes) seen in the record 1.2 million tonnes (total crop) 1995/96 year.
""Last year's mid-crop (200,000 tonnes) was exceptional. I think the sizes will return to more normal levels,"" said another crop analyst, pointing to a range of 110-120 range with lowest grades possibly touching 150.
Ivory Coast's main crop reached around one million tonnes by the season's closing date of April 27. Crop analysts expect the mid-crop to be down on 1995/96 with some early forecasts in a 160-180,000 tonnes range.
Crop analysts said said plantation soil moiture levels had dropped in some areas after heavy wet season rains in April eased off in the first ten days of May.
""There was less moisture than I thought there would be, but it is not a problem,"" said one.
Bean sizes would swell if June rains were sufficient.
""I do not have a pessimistic view of mid-crop,"" said the analyst. ""As far as I am concerned soil humidity is average but our teams have not yet completed their tour.""
Crop analysts returning from upcountry farm inspections reported little harvesting and drying of cocoa. They did not expect mid-crop arrivals at port to strenghten until June -- after a lull in activity between the main and mid-crops.
""What is there will sit around for mixing in with better beans and larger quantities. It is just not worth the farmers selling yet,"" said one.
Exporters say late main crop and a trickle of mid-crop beans arriving at ports are in a 105-110 range.
""Last year, even the tail of the mid-crop met export standards,"" said one. Special contracts for grades outside the official export standard would still be exported.
""Discounts will be applied, as for poor coffee beans, but it will all be exported,"" he added.
Ivory Coast aims to process 50 percent of its annual cocoa crop by the year 2,000, partly to remove poorer grades from export markets, but also to push up world prices while adding export value.
Local processors, with three factories, have a total bean processing capacity of around 160,000 tonnes.
That figure could rise to at least 209,000 tonnes in 1996/97 as local factories build extensions and possible oil-palm factory capacity for cocoa bean processing comes on line.
Other factories already under construction or in final planning stages could take Ivorian bean processing capacity to over 350,000 tonnes by 1998/99 (Corrects from 1997/98) -- without taking into account a raft of plans in early discussion stages.

4156,"Stowaway deaths in the holds of cargo ships leaving West Africa are prompting calls for concerted international action to combat the problem.
Dockers at one port in Britain found the bodies of seven young Africans amid the cargo in ships carrying variously cocoa, coconut and oilseeds.
Three Africans died in the hold of another cocoa ship in Ivory Coast's main port Abidjan in February after inhaling toxic pecticides, leading to rejection of the 10,000 tonne consignment by American buyers.
Veterans in the cocoa trade recall the curious case of an African head that turned up in a sack of cocoa from Nigeria.
""The West African problem is fairly intense at the moment,"" says Chris Horrocks, Secretary-General of the International Chamber of Shipping.
""Industry has to gear up Western governments to bring the matter up but as their interests are not directly at stake it is often a token gesture,"" he said by telephone from London.
British Prime Minister John Major agrees something needs to be done.
""We do need to examine both with the host countries and with the shipping lines better arrangements to ensure that they (stowaways) are not hidden away on their ships,"" he told parliament in response to a question.
GOVERNMENTS RELUCTANT TO ACT
But shipping officials say governments fail to act out of fear of facing the bills for handling stowaways, a cost normally borne by shipping lines and their insurers.
Horrocks said the U.N. International Maritime Organisation in London had set up a committee to consider recommendations for a convention on stowaways but a rapid conclusion was unlikely.
Many stowaways, fugitives from war or poverty, are looking for a better life in the West. Others simply want adventure.
""One boy was found at Marseille with his toothbrush and identity papers,"" said a shipping agent who investigates such cases. ""He asked us to send him back home so he didn't miss any more classes. He was a real Tom Sawyer type.""
Most stowaways carry no proof of identity or nationality, prolonging procedures for repatriation or granting of asylum.
Ivory Coast, a beacon of economic and political stability in West Africa, has become a magnet for stowaways from neighbouring states -- especially Nigeria, Ghana and war-ravaged Liberia.
Port police say about 200 cases were reported in Ivory Coast in 1996.
""Stowaways slip on board from the lagoons at night or climb over port walls,"" said an Ivorian Transport Ministry spokesman. ""How to stop them is purely a police matter.""
SOME DEATHS MAY NEVER GET REPORTED
Investigators say many cases probably go unreported. ""If bodies are found at sea they are reported at the destination port but some are probably thrown overboard,"" one said.
Shipping agents say port security is very low on the list of priorities in the African countries concerned. Posting extra port guards is costly and of little value when guards can be bribed to turn a blind eye.
""All African ports suffer from the same problem,"" said a ship surveyor who has worked in most of Africa's principal ports for over 25 years. ""We always have a number of cases in hand.""
""People talk about complicity of the crew but I find it hard to believe stowaways are paying for their passage. Most are completely destitute when they get on board.""
As immigration laws around the world are tightened, particularly in rich countries targeted by stowaways, captains find it more and more difficult to land illegal passengers.
They face the prospect of having to keep stowaways on board for years or heavy fines or jail for letting them ashore.
SOME STRIKE IT LUCKY, MANY DON'T
Some stowaways reach their promised land. Some manage to stay there. Many don't.
The unlucky ones drown, starve, suffocate.
Eleven Nigerians survived a three-day ordeal off South Africa's Dyer Island in January when they were cast adrift on an oil-drum raft in shark-infested waters.
Seven Ghanaians who stowed away on a cocoa ship heading for France were not so lucky. Their plight -- and the story of an eighth stowaway who survived -- became the subject of a joint British-American film released in Ghana and worldwide last October.
The case highlighted problems of international jurisdiction over murders at sea. Testimony of the survivor, Kingsley Ofusu, before a French court in 1996 led to murder convictions for the Ukrainian captain and crew of the MC Ruby.
Ghana launched a campaign to publicise the deaths and discourage other would-be stowaways.
It has also tightened security at the ports but the lure of the bright lights of Europe and the Americas remains a powerful incentive -- as the rising death toll illustrates.

4161,"Ivorian coffee exports are set to rise in late February after world price increases but poor quality could mean only 150,000 tonnes of the 1996/97 season's crop is marketed, industry sources say.
""I really cannot see much more than 150,000 tonnes being exportable this year,"" one port quality analyst told Reuters.
Industry sources expect exports to take off before March.
""There are a good number of shipments for late February,"" a San Pedro-based exporter said. ""People are waking up because of the prices but exports now are still minimal.""
Existing contracts would sustain export volumes into March and April, he added. ""The rest (of 1996/97 exports) depends on which way the dollar moves,"" he said.
Ivory Coast opened its 1996/97 coffee season on November 14, delayed from around October 1, in an attempt to set guide farmgate prices closer to then plummeting world spot rates.
Upcountry buying and exports were minimal in late 1996 as bankers were reluctant to fund coffee buying and put up export guarantees as world prices and local bean quality crashed.
Upcountry buyers said farmers had taken little care over selecting beans during late 1996 harvesting. Subsequent rains and long storage had led to deterioration and slowed down sorting.
""For every 500 tonnes of grade two coffee exported you need to sift 1,000 tonnes,"" said one forwarder in Abidjan.
Arrivals by early February are estimated to be upwards of 30,000 tonnes with exports lagging at 12,000 tonnes.
Quality in 1996/97 has varied widely by region with northwestern coffee seen by buyers as best. Largely unusable black beans were proving a problem, they said.
""In some places we have seen 60 percent black beans,"" said one buyer. ""Black beans and debris are still slowing grading.""
An exporter said: ""Ivory Coast can only condition 20,000 tonnes of coffee each month so exports of that amount would be very good.""
In 1995/96, Ivorian coffee exports totalled 22,461 tonnes by the end of February with only 2,332 tonnes exported in February itself.
Exports then picked up to around 15,000 tonnes in March and 21,000 tonnes in April. Arrivals data were less clear.
Ivory Coast exported 150,000 tonnes of its total 180,000 tonnes 1995/96 crop and has forecast a total crop of 230,000 tonnes for this year. Some upcountry buyers expect 250,000 tonnes or more.
Ivorian coffee marketing usually does not get underway until peak cocoa arrivals tail off after January as stored cocoa deteriorates faster than coffee.
One coffee plantation manager in central Ivory Coast said later season arrivals could be lower than expected if dry conditions were not broken by rain.
""There is a risk of damage to coffee trees but cocoa is holding on well. We need a couple of rains,"" he added.
A light Harmattan wind followed by hot weather settled over Ivory Coast in late January. Rains since have been scant.
""Rains for January are 20 percent down on normal,"" the plantation managter said by telephone on Friday. ""We make a little clearing around the trunk (of the tree) to allow watering while the threat of dessication persists,"" he added.
Weeds had been allowed to grow up around young bushes to protect them from direct sun, he said.
A report for Ivory Coast on sector liberalisation and quality by a private British consultant was ready at the end of January but late fee payment meant it had not been delivered.
""Last year exporters took anything so farmers have got out of the habit of maintaining trees,"" said one Gagnoa-based buyer.

Latest bean sizes were around 90-105 beans per 100 grams, against an export standard of 105 with up to eight percent humidity, industry buyers said.
""Bean sizes are tailing off now but smaller ones are still up-country,"" said one.
Exporters are gearing up for mid-crop arrivals after returning from Easter holidays, but crop analysts have not completed up-country pod tallies to give an indication of volumes, they said.
Early estimates range from 100,000 tonnes to well over 160,000, down on 200,000 in the 1995/96 season, crop analysts said.
""If good rains now carry on and cherelles survive through April and May, I see no reason to be pessimistic,"" said one. ""Estimates will be out later in April but most pod counters will be up-country in mid-April.""
Some main crop could be held back to mix with mid-crop to reach an overall export standard.
Tree crop and declared mid-crop could vary widely, he said.
Warehouse stocks totalled up to 400,000 tonnes in early 1997 as exporters held back cocoa bought through auction for December contracts from the Caistab marketing body.
Auction prices were out of line with world rates before a rally ahead of March contracts, they said at the time.

4170,"Heavy late-March rains favoured Ivorian mid-crop cocoa harvest prospects as the month's rainfall total edged up to long-term average levels after a February drought, weather and crop analysts said on Monday.
""The rains have been very satisfactory lately,"" said a National Weather centre spokesman. ""We are back to around average levels and the rains are continuing into April.""
Official weather data for the third 10 days of March showed rains at 10 weather stations totalled 742 mm against 208 mm in the previous 10 days. An average of 111 mm fell in March.
Crop analysts said weather data weighted for plantation density and long term productivity suggested the March rains were in line with a 20-year average of around 105 mm.
Rains falling on average on five out of ten days were spread widely over Ivory Coast's cocoa belt but heaviest falls were in central areas around Daloa, Gagnoa, Yamoussoukro and Abidjan.
""Everything now depends on the (mid-crop) pod-count,"" said one drop analyst.
""We had good January rains, bad February rains and good March rains. I remain an optimist (for midcrop harvest volumes),"" he added.
Rains during the second ten days of March were heaviest in less productive eastern border areas.
Otherwise, south-western forest areas, densely planted with productive hybrid trees, have tended to receive the most.
Crop analysts said in early March that regular showers up to April would determine how close this year's mid-crop would be to the bumper 200,000 tonnes in the record 1.2 million tonnes 1995/96 (Oct-Sept) harvest season.
The 1996/97 mid-crop could exceed 150,000 tonnes if rains were sufficient, one said, adding that harvest predictions would be reviewed in April when pods on trees gave a better idea of yields.
The data, from Ivory Coast's national weather station, showed the following rainfall (mm) for the third 10 days of March in key growing areas plus the commercial capital Abidjan (previous 10 days in brackets):
Daloa 105.8 (2.7), Gagnoa 142.8 (20.2), San Pedro 18.3 (12.6), Tabou 1.0 (21) Man 98.7 (2.0), Dimbokro 73.2 (32.3), Yamoussoukro 83.8 (0), Abidjan 128.8 (8.9), Sassandra 10.6 (8.8), Adiake 64.5 (13.9), Korhogo 14.2 (0).

4172,"Ivory Coast plans to flush illegal cocoa and coffee planters out of protected forests but crop production is likely to fall by less than five percent of annual output, say donors and crop analysts.
The government forecast 1996/97 (Oct-Sept) cocoa production of 950,000 tonnes but some private analysts expect closer to 1.1 million tonnes by the time the season ends in September.
Ivory Coast's government said on Friday that 72,000 peasant farmers and their familes were illegally occupying protected forest.
""This explains the gap between our production forecasts and the eventual outcome,"" Commodities Minister Guy-Alain Gauze said on the sidelines of an International Cocoa Organization meeting in London this week. ""It is a big problem,"" he added.
Ivory Coast produced an unexpected record of 1.2 million tonnes of cocoa in 1995/96 (Oct-Sept) and 180,000 tonnes of coffee.
A cabinet statement on measures to protect forests in line with donor loan terms said 72,000 farmers, and a total of 450,000 people, had settled in classified forest.
It gave no timetable for destroying illegal plantations, relocating farmers and reforesting lands.
Donors say protected forest cover has been slashed from 13 million hectares before independance from France in 1960.
""By 1998, only 3.6 million hectares survived,"" World Bank analyst Leandre G'Beli told Reuters on Wednesday.
Peasants slash and burn to clear protected forest, undeterred by the presence of armed guards. Forested areas generally receive better rainfall than deforested areas, which are exposed to drying winds harmful to trees.
""Cocoa production continues its increasing trend, contrary to what many feared,"" said one donor official who would not be named. ""Remaining forests are being put into production.""
Illegal production was concentrated in 21 of Ivory Coast's 60 or more protected forest areas, he added.
One crop researcher regularly making deep forays into forests to assess cocoa crop prospects recently took a helicopter trip over Tai, the largest national forest.
""The forest is now a doughnut,"" he said. ""There is a massive hole in the middle.""
Refugees from Liberia's eight year civil war have been blamed for raising output in Tai where it borders on Liberia but critics say Ivory Coast's traditionally rural population is mainly responsible for swelling crop volumes.
Gauze put illegal output at about 100,000 tonnes but donors say the figure is smaller, due to low labour and land productivity and poorly defined land tenure laws discouraging careful farm management.
""It is less than five percent (of annual production),"" World Bank analyst Leandre Gbeli told Reuters, adding: ""A lot of other forest has been chopped down but that is not protected. The two should not be confused.""
A spokesman for Ivory Coast's state forestry corporation SODEFOR said government eviction plans were not yet clear.
Donors, including the World Bank, have made forest conservation a condition for loans.
""(Cocoa) continues to provide the best remuneration for farmers,"" said one donor official. ""We will believe (the plan) when we see results on the ground... Announcements are not necessarily put into effect.""
Ivory Coast launched a donor-sponsored National Environmental Action Plan in late 1996 which included Forest Sector Projects up to 2010 aimed at working closely with villagers to protect forests. The government is also looking at a new forestry tax regime to augment funds for World Bank-sponsored re-forestation. --Abidjan newsroom +225 21 90 90

4174,"African coffee ministers meet on Thursday to discuss cutting robusta exports following a January agreement among world producers, but some officials say disease and drought make cuts unnecessary in some countries.
African producers agreed after a January meeting of the Association of Coffee Producing Countries to cut robusta exports by a total of 850,000 60-kilo bags between January and June 1997 in an attempt to force up prices.
Individual country quotas were left to be decided later.
""We shall be looking into the export programme in light of the Rio (de Janeiro) agreement and our objective is to ensure a transparent and effective implementation,"" said a spokesman for the Inter-African Coffee Organisation (IACO).
""The ministers will take a decision on how to allocate the share which falls on Africa and how to deal with shortfalls,"" said IACO chief economist Donald Kaberuka. ""We will also discuss the issue of non-member countries.""
Eight countries will take part in the talks -- Uganda, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Kenya, Zaire, Tanzania, Madagascar and Ethiopia.
Quotas for individual countries set at the meeting would not be made public.
""Some people have said we will not make any cuts but that is not true,"" said Kaberuka.
A Uganda Coffee Development Authority (UCDA) official said this week that drought and disease had cut into that country's exports, making quotas unnecessary.
Uganda is Africa's largest robusta producer.
It produced around 4,644,397 60-kilo bags in 1996 against 3,079,261 in 1995, according to IACO. Ivory Coast produced 2,526,198 and 2,493,754 over the same periods.
Analysts in Ivory Coast say bean quality problems could mean no more than 130,000-150,000 tonnes will be exported in 1996/97 (Oct-Sept) despite an official forecast of 230,000 tonnes.
Ivorian exports by the end of January totalled little more than 24,000 tonnes. The season opened on November 14.
The Coffee Board of Kenya, also citing drought and disease, has forecast a drop in production and earnings this year.
Zaire's production has been cut by the conflict there since late 1996.

4176,"Cocoa bean exports from Ivory Coast jumped to 171,104 tonnes in March, against 148,827 in February and 169,065 in March 1996, official shipping data show.
March exports and bean quality were similar to last year's levels even though the 1996/97 crop is expected by pod counters to fall short of last year's 1.2 million tonne record, exporters said.
""Last year there was a demand peak earlier in the year but this year demand came later,"" said one shipper. ""March (1997) has been one of the biggest shipment months ever so we are looking hard at the (export) figures.""
Abidjan handled 119,123 tonnes of March 1997 exports with a further 51,981 tonnes leaving via the second port of San Pedro.
Cumulative exports for the first six months of 1996/97 (Oct-Sept) totalled 767,337 tonnes, against 722,646 by the end of March in 1995/96.
""The average bean count so far has been 101 (beans per 100 grams) so quality has been very good,"" said the exporter, adding that bean sizes last week averaged 100/100 grams.
Ivory Coast's bean export standard is 105 beans per 100 grams with less than eight percent humidity.
Some upcountry buyers have pointed to slipping bean sizes ahead of the mid-crop (May-Sept).
The main destinations for March exports from Abidjan were broadly the same as last year. North-west European ports received 85,198 tonnes, with 60,812 for Amsterdam. U.S. east coast ports took 17,161, including 13,865 for New York.
Separate figures by destination for San Pedro were not immediately available.
Shipments from the two ports during the main January and March cocoa contract months totalled 166,268 tonnes and 171,104 tonnes, against 174,927 and 169,065 last year.
Some shipments loaded in late February 1997 had probably been recorded as March exports, said one shipper.
""The (export) figure is very high for one month but bulk shipments might have put the volume up,"" he added.
Ivory Coast produced a crop of 1.2 million tonnes in 1995/96 and private forecasts for 1996/97 range up to at least 1.15 million tonnes.
Port arrivals stood at around 982,000 tonnes by mid-April as the main crop (Oct-April) tailed off, compared with 1.03 million tonnes in 1995/96, industry sources said this week.
Analysts have made preliminary harvest estimates of up to 180,000 tonnes for the mid-crop (May-Sept), but steady rains needed into June will partly determine final volumes.
Ivory Coast has not revised its 1996/97 total crop forecast of 950,000 tonnes, but U.K.-based broker GNI cut on Wednesday set its full year 1996/97 Ivory Coast cocoa crop estimate at 1.15 million tonnes.
GNI sharply cut its estimate of this year's world cocoa supply deficit from 180,000 tonnes to 33,000.

4184,"Exports of Ivorian cocoa totalled 150,000 tonnes in January taking the 1996/97 season's cumulative total to 416,000 tonnes since October 1, port sources said on Tuesday.
""Warehouses are still full,"" said one port source.
Latest figures on arrivals of cocoa at ports were not immediately available but are widely expected to total 800,000 tonnes since October 1. The figures, for Abidjan and San Pedro ports, were expected to be clearer this week.
Total dedicated warehouse space is put by sources at close to 400,000 tonnes, meaning stocks of around the same amount.
Quality inspectors said bean humidity levels were around 7.5-8.0 percent with grain sizes of 95-100 beans per 100 grammes.
Export standards allow a maximum of eight percent humidity and 105 beans per 100 grammes.
Shipping line managers said break bulk (loose beans in holds) shipment of cocoa was proving more popular with clients than shipment in containers.
""There is a lot of demand for mega-bulk,"" said one shipping line manager, referring to the trade name for loose bulk, increasingly favoured by Amsterdam-based cocoa processors.
Higher-than-expected arrivals of cocoa, coupled with low overseas demand and world prices, and difficulty in obtaining export contracts led to the build-up of stocks in January.
Forwarders expect large shipments to leave against March delivery. Some exporters have held on to stock in the hope of rising prices. Prices last week hit 18-month lows.
Arrivals figures are expected this week to indicate whether volumes reaching ports will tail off ahead of the April-Sept mid-crop.
Exporters expect a total crop of around a million tonnes but private forecasters have said a good mid-crop could take total volumes closer to 1.1 million tonnes -- still short of last season's record 1.2 million tonnes.
A firmer idea of mid-crop prospects is expected later this month as flower survival rates and pod-setting patterns emerge.
Official port statistics for January will not be available until February. Official cumulative exports for the first three months of the 1996/97 (Oct-Sept) season were shown as only 309,762 tonnes compared with 270,257 tonnes in the same period of 1995/96.

4189,"Rains in Ivory Coast's southern cocoa belt picked up in late February and an overall deficit stretching into March has not stressed trees too much, weather and crop analysts said on Tuesday.
""Rains have continued along the south coast and in forest areas, and soon we expect them to start moving further to the north,"" said a national weather centre spokesman on Tuesday, adding that there was no reason for trees to be over-stressed.
Crop analysts said trees were beginning to show some reaction to prolonged dry weather but no signs of damage.
""People are forgetting that we had over 200 percent of normal rains in December and January,"" said one. ""We will be in trouble if there are no rains in March but all the signs indicate that will just not be the case.""
Ivorian commodities minister Guy-Alain Gauze said on Monday the 1996/97 crop would be less than one million tonnes, despite private estimates of up to 1.1 million.
""The weather has been very dry, despite reports that it has been raining recently...We do not call this rain,"" he said.
Little or no rain fell in most areas during the first 20 days of February leading to concern that possible damage to trees would reduce mid-crop (April-Sept) potential and reduce bean sizes in developing pods.
But official data for the last eight days of the month show average rainfall at 10 weather stations of 12.24 mm, against 1.31 mm in the previous 10 days and 15.5mm for the last eight days of February last year.
Ivory Coast produced a record 1.2 million tonnes 1995/96 crop after a bumper 200,000 tonnes mid-crop.
Some industry forecasters raised 1996/97 crop estimates after strong main crop arrivals. Mid-crop prospects are expected to be clearer by mid-March as pod counters complete tallies.
Late mid-crop volumes depend partly on rains up to April.
""Normally we get a bit more rain in early March but they are a bit late,"" said the weather centre spokesman. ""If dry weather continues until the end of the month trees might be over-stressed but some stress is normal for this time of year.""
A crop analyst said, ""There is some yellowing of leaves which we usually see in January, but I am not worried.""
Others returning from growing areas said drizzle had fallen in southern regions with isolated thunderstorms.
""There was not much rain but we are still optimistic that levels will increase soon,"" one said. ""My figures show average rainfall of 20 mm for February against (an average) 54 mm.""
Late 1996 rains and a mild January harmattan wind meant the effects of drought in February had not been as harsh as might otherwise have been the case, said crop analaysts.
On some eastern cocoa and coffee plantations, fires that had been started to clear undergrowth had got out of control.
""There has been some damage to badly maintained plantations but on farms we usually visit the fire swept through undergrowth in a flash and did not affect trees,"" said one crop analyst.
""Overall, there doesn't appear to have been much serious damage at all,"" he said. ""It sounds worse than it is, although some coffee farms were burnt to the ground.""
Data from the 10 national weather stations showed the following total rainfall for the last eight days of February in key growing areas plus the commercial capital Abidjan (previous 10 days in brackets)-
Dalao 2.7 mm (0), Gagnoa 20.2 mm (0), San Pedro 12.6 mm (0.1), Tabou 21 mm (0.1) and Man 2.0 mm (0), Dimbokro 32.3 (0), Yamoussoukro 0 mm (0), Abidjan 8.9 mm (2.7), Sassandra 8.8 mm (0), Adiake 13.9 mm (10.3), Korhogo 0 mm (0).

4190,"Heavy April rains in Ivorian cocoa areas have favoured mid-crop (May-Sept) pod growth and flowering for early 1997/98 main crop (Oct-April) harvests, weather and crop analyts said on Thursday.
""At the end of March we were at 109 percent of the 10-year average (Jan-Mar) in all but a few areas,"" said one crop analyst. ""I would say April has been about average but the last 10 days will give the overall picture.""
National weather centre forecasters said coastal and inland areas, particularly around Yamoussoukro and Gagnoa, had received well above average levels in the first 20 days of April. ""If rains are heavy for the last 10 days of April you can say the (long) rainy season has begun (usually lasting until August).""
Many crop analysts use private data from undisclosed areas but official weather data for the first 20 days of April showed rains at 10 weather stations averaged 78.85 mm. A total of 95 mm fell in the first 10 days of April and 693.5 in the second.
One crop analyst put overall 1997 rainfall at just below average. Another said rains had risen to 145 mm against his 10-year average figure of 134 mm for 12 stations. Rains in some areas had been between 35-145 percent above normal.
""March and April have been good and recent rains also seem quite heavy,"" said one. ""April could be close to its average.""
March rains averaged 111 mm, against crop analysts' long-term averages ranging from 80-90 mm. February rains of 10 mm (against a usual 50 mm average) had threatened mid crop potential until rain fell later, crop analysts said.
Young flowers for 1997/98 main crop harvests where more abundant than at the same time last year but accurate predictions of harvests would not be possible until June onwards, analysts said.
Crop analysts' estimates of the 1996/97 midcrop range between 150,000 tonnes and 200,000 tonnes but rains into May will partly determine harvests. Arrivals stood at 970-980,000 tonnes by mid April.
""Mid-crop assessments are particularly difficult. You need to visit four times as many sites for an accurate indication because of the smaller number of pods involved,"" one explained.
Mid-crop arrivals, with smaller bean sizes than last year's export grade harvests (up to 105 beans/100 grammes), are expected from early May -- against mid-April last year.
One set of official weather data show rainfall averages for the first three months of 1997 were 34.6, 11.3 and 100 mm respectively -- against 14.2, 50.2 and 64.9 in the record 1.2 million tonnes 1995/96 season.
The long-term averages for the same three months (1987-96) were 13.6, 37.4, 83.2. For April, the average was 130.4.
The latest April 1997 data, from Ivory Coast's national weather station, showed the following rainfall (mm) for the first 10 days of April in key growing areas plus the commercial capital Abidjan (previous 10 days bracketed):
Daloa 0.2 (105.8), Gagnoa 0 (142.8), San Pedro 0 (18.3), Tabou 0.4 (1.0) Man 5.4 (98.7), Dimbokro 18.3 (73.2), Yamoussoukro 22.1 (83.8), Abidjan 0 (128.8), Sassandra 0 (10.6), Adiake 33.7 (64.5), Korhogo 15.1 (14.2).

4191,"Declared cocoa arrivals at Ivorian ports for Ivory Coast's 1996/97 (October-April) main crop totalled 970-980,000 tonnes by April 14, close to record levels seen in the 1995/96 season, exporters and crop analysts said.
The 1995/96 main crop (ending April 30) reached just over a million tonnes.
""Arrivals are now at a trickle compared to last year but it is still possible the total (main crop) will reach a million by the end of the month,"" said one crop analyst.
Exporters said cocoa was arriving at Ivory Coast's two ports -- Abidjan and San Pedro -- at a total of up to 5,000 tonnes a week, compared to 8,000 tonnes a week in 1995/96.
Little or no main crop cocoa remained on south-western plantations visited by Reuters. ""Cocoa is now for the mid-crop (usually smaller, poorer quality beans),"" said one coastal area buyer.
Ivory Coast has forecast 950,000 tonnes for the 1996/97 season but some private forecasters upgraded their full-year predictions from that level to around 1.1 million tonnes after large arrivals in early 1997.
Last year, Ivory Coast produced a full-year record of 1.2 million tonnes after a bumper 200,000 tonne mid-crop (May-September).
Sources said Ministry of Agriculture data showed cocoa arrivals to April 4 (from October 24) stood at 940,0000 tonnes -- about six percent down from 1,003,366 last year. Another 40,000 tonnes or so should be added to the 1996/97 figure as the season opened three weeks later than the usual October 1, they said.
Other arrivals data seen by Reuters gave similar figures.
""The latest figures I have from the Caistab (cocoa and coffee marketing board) show arrivals at about 975,000 by April 14 but that is after some downward adjustments for sub-grade (inferior beans),"" said one source.
Arrivals to the end of the main crop in 1994/95 were 815,000 tonnes, with weekly arrivals of under 4,000 tonnes.
Trade sources say exporters usually over-estimate arrivals early in the season to help secure bank finance, but square accounts later in the season by under-declaring.
Crop forecasters say declared arrivals in Ivory Coast can exceed tree crop harvests as quantities of cocoa are carried between seasons in the hope of price rises and to mix poor with good quality cocoa.
One cocoa buyer for Ivorian exporter Jean-Abile Gal (JAG) said the latest cocoa bean sizes averaged 98 beans per 100 grammes at San Pedro, and 105 at the main port, Abidjan -- against an export standard of up to 105 with less than eight percent humidity.
Exporters said average humidity levels at both ports were below eight percent.
Up-country buyers' stores in coastal and south-western areas were mostly empty, except for coffee, but larger warehouses at San Pedro, including JAG's, were still well stocked.
""There is nothing left. Some exporters are desperate to meet contracts and cannot get cocoa,"" said one buyer. ""Cocoa harvested now is really for the mid-crop (from May).""
Port forwarders' figures seen by Reuters showed 1996/97 cocoa volumes handled 12 percent down on 1995/96, but managers said warehouse stocks for end-April shipment would close the gap.
""It is very acceptable. We thought the gap could be twice that,"" said a manager for SAGA, San Pedro's largest forwarder. ""Last year, arrivals figures were a lot more available so it has been harder to track.""
Cocoa bean shipments rose from 39,637 tonnes in February to 51,981 in March and at least another 10,000 tonnes was due to leave next week.
""Some of what is left in stores will be for local processors (using around 135,000 tonnes of beans a year),"" said one crop analyst.
SACO, San Pedro's only factory, had large volumes of produce stored in sheds with bagged cocoa under external awnings. Cocoa product exports totalled around 4,000 tonnes for February and March.
Several new warehouses are planned to increase port cocoa storage capacity. New factories are also in the pipeline.
Exporters are now looking forward to pod counters' mid-crop predictions, expected this month, and further news on Ivory Coast's intention to destroy illegal cocoa plantations in classified forest areas.
The country's Minister for Commodities, Guy-Alain Gauze, said earlier on Friday in the Netherlands that the upcoming mid-crop would be somewhere near 100,000 tonnes.

4198,"Ivory Coast is planning to streamline management of mining policy to cut red tape and attract more investors to its expanding gold mining sector.
""There should be some big changes in about three weeks,"" a foreign advisor to the Ministry of Mines told Reuters. ""Existing rules will not change but management will be tightened to make things run smoothly.""
Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer, introduced a new mining code in 1996 to simplify rules for investors and broaden its agriculture-dependent economy.  
Ministry of Mines officials said around 24 companies holding a total of over 55 exploration permits were searching mainly for gold and nickel.
Firms rushing to West Africa since the Cold War ended have been attracted by Ivorian political and mining code reforms.
Three new permits were approved in March alone but prospectors, and two working gold mines, point to bureaucracy which they say still dogs operations. They want decision times cut and better coordination between mining and other ministries.  
""What the Minister of Finance and what the Minister of Mines says are two different things,"" Philippe Palanque, managing director of Ivory Coast's largest mine, SMI (Societe des Mines d'Ity), which is prospecting around its existing site.
""Administrative decisions are sometimes taken all the way up to the Prime Minister,"" said another exploration geologist.  
Ivory Coast's annual gold output of less than three tonnes a year is dwarfed by mining giant Ghana's annual output of 40 tonnes. Recent finds in Mali are set to at least double national production to over 10 tonnes, but underlying Birimian greenstone geology is similar throughout the sub-region.
""Ivory Cost had no mining experience like Ghana, so development has been slow while Mali and Burkina have raced ahead in the 1990's,"" Joe Hinzer, General Manager at Ivory Coast's other gold mine SOMIAF (Societe Miniere d'Afema) told Reuters.  
""Ivory Coast has good potential but discoveries like Ghana and Mali follow no rhyme or reason,"" said one geologist, adding that a find of one million ounces would be seen as good.
SMI opened in 1990 and was privatised last year. It predicts a gold production, by leaching ores with cyanide, of 1,523 kilos in 1996/97 after ouptut of 1,276 last year.
SOMIAF says its production is set to jump to 935 kilos against 565 last year and has started feasibility studies for expanding operations in the next three years.  
Newcomers are undeterrred by small gold ouptut, pointing to geological potential, infrastructure, and political stability.
""(The mining code) is not a star example but it works. There are some pretty good tax exemptions,"" says Peter Pelly, geologist for South Africa-based Gencor which, with other firms, has joined a gold rush to West Africa.
Exploration companies are given a customs duty waiver on imports but they say red tape delays securing the exemption.
State participation in projects has waned however, with mining develpment arm SODEMI a candidate for privatisation.  
""In the last year since the mining act a lot of companies have gone straight into ventures without Sodemi,"" says Gencor.
Mining firms arriving in Ivory Coast in the early 1990's are still tied into joint-ventures but benefit from 30 years of mapping and prospection by SODEMI.
""Sodemi is improving as it gains more experience but at one stage we almost pulled out as the goal posts kept changing,"" said one geologist, citing problems over board representation.  
Other mining and investment laws give the state a free ride of 10 percent of mining profits but allow firms to repatriate funds and dividends.
Taxes are now levied at three percent of turnover rather than profits, while tax breaks apply for mining investments of 500 million CFA or more.
Processing time for permits of up to 1000 square km, valid for three years but renewable twice for two years, was slashed from over a year to a few weeks.  
""The fiscal regime is also better but there needs to be more work on banking and accounts as well as uniform implementation of different mining code provisions,"" said one mine manager.
Ivorian officials say relaxation of unwritten gold sales rules are being considered. Gold from SMI is currently marketed at spot rates through West Africa's central bank, (BCEAO).
""We are paid the going gold rate but payments are often delayed,"" says Planque. ""We cannot raise loans against the gold or stabilise profits on the futures market,""  
SMI, which is planning to open a new gold mine as part of a French (BRGM) and Australian (Normandy Mining) group, La Source, also wants clearer rules on illegal mining at its proposed site.
""At the moment there are too many, over 5,000, artisanal miners from Liberia, Guinea and Mali,"" says Palanque.

4201,"North American garbage companies can be expected to continue picking over each others' assets as big firms sell off money-losers and small players consolidate, the top executives of the biggest haulers and handlers of waste said on Monday.
At a conference held by the Raymond James brokerage and investment bank, a half dozen trash hauling companies made presentations to investors. In all the talks, asset strategy figured prominently.  
In the top tier of the industry, the two biggest U.S. firms -- WMX Technologies Inc and Browning Ferris Industries Inc -- control about a quarter of the $35 billion solid waste market.
Both WMX and BFI are fast shedding non-core and unprofitable operations as they reposition and rationalize after years of undisciplined acquisitions, analysts said. At the same time, Canadian giant Laidlaw Inc is transforming itself into a transportation company and leaving the solid waste market, as well as the $3.5 billion hazardous waste market, in which it had dominated in North America.  
At the lower levels, fast-growing mid-sized companies -- such as USA Waste Services Inc, United Waste Systems Inc and Superior Services Inc -- are playing the consolidation game. By sifting through the giants' dross and snapping up deals from among dozens of small, private firms, the mid-cap players are growing rapidly.
""At the end of the day, you'll have an industry that has sorted through its asset base so that several companies will be better positioned,"" said Todd Holmes, vice president at Browing Ferris, based in Houston.  
Trash hauling and handling turned into a hot business in North America in the 1970s with the rise of environmentalism and stricter government regulation of polluters. Riding a wave of rapid consolidation in a highly fragmented industry, innovators like WMX and BFI experienced explosive growth. In its first 20 years, industry leader WMX made 2,000 acquisitions.
But the boom years ended in the 1990s with a levelling of environmental regulation, greater market concentration among companies and a surplus of supply in several key markets.  
In addition, added Laidlaw chief executive James Bullock, ""The focus of solid waste handling is migrating away from landfill to recycling, which has lower (profit) margins and suffers from the vagaries of commodity prices.""
For WMX and BFI, too, growth by acquisition hit an inevitable ceiling as the pool of affordable targets dried up.
""The consolidation strategy was unsustainable for us,"" said WMX chief financial officer John Sanford.
Oak Brook, Ill.-based WMX reacted to these changes by diversifying in the 1990s into related businesses, but the strategy failed, leading to shareholder disappointment.  
Laidlaw, based in Burlington, Ont., has separated itself from its solid and hazardous waste operations. It still owns sizable stakes in the successor companies -- Laidlaw Environmental Services and Allied Waste Industries Inc -- but expects to sell its interests, valued at a combined $1.2 billion.
""Over time, you will see us exit our investments in both of those,"" Bullock said in an interview with Reuters.
At the next level down, growth by acquisition continues. The business has virtually no barriers to entry -- any outfit with a half-dozen garbage trucks can get a route and make itself a takeover target.
As a result, Bullock said, ""The little guys are still playing the consolidation game...They can be successful at that for a while.""

4209,"Boehringer Mannheim Corp, a unit of privately held Corange Ltd, said data released Monday at an American College of Cardiology conference leveled the playing field between Boehringer and Genentech Inc in the market for clot-busting drugs to treat acute heart attack.
""What this study showed was comparability between the two products.... Essentially, at this point it will be a marketing fight,"" said Gregory Fulton, director of marketing for Boehringer's pharmaceuticals unit.  
Results from the GUSTO III study showed that Boehringer's Retavase did not save more lives than Genentech's Activase, better known as TPA, researchers reported. In the trial, 10,139 patients received Retavase, while 4,921 patients received TPA. Both drugs, as well as another called streptokinase, are commonly administered within six hours after a heart attack.
""Retavase...did not provide statistically significant benefit in 30-day mortality as compared to (TPA),"" Genentech said in a statement released in conjunction with reporting of the data.  
As a result, Genentech said, Retavase failed to score the win which Boehringer had hoped for from the study -- proof that the drug is better than TPA, long the dominant drug in the field.
""We do not dispute that. The results were very clear,"" said Boehringer's Fulton. At the same time, he said, GUSTO III showed the two drugs to be roughly comparable and Boehringer is ""very happy with that.""
The researchers reported that the study's 30-day mortality rate was 7.43 percent for Retavase, versus 7.22 percent for TPA; total intracranial bleeding rate for Retavase was 0.91 percent and 0.88 percent for TPA; and total stroke rate for Retavase was 1.67 percent and 1.83 percent for TPA.
""GUSTO III reinforces the role (TPA) plays in savings lives every day,"" Genentech vice president of clinical research Dr. David Stump said in a statement.

4221,"Eli Lilly &amp; Co is fighting in Kentucky this week to end the last major legal battle still lingering from Prozac's liability troubles of the early 1990s.
The Indianapolis-based drug giant Wednesday asked the Kentucky Court of Appeals to halt a hearing set for Thursday in Louisville before Jefferson Circuit Judge John Potter.
Potter's hearing would likely reveal publicly how and for how much Lilly and plaintiffs agreed to end a landmark case involving Prozac and a 1989 mass murder in Louisville.  
Lilly wants to keep the details of the agreement under wraps, although it conceded for the first time Monday that the so-called Joseph Wesbecker case was settled, at least in part.
For months, the company had said only that it reached a pre-verdict agreement in the case and that an unspecified amount of money changed hands as a result.
""We acknowledge that after the jury verdict, the high-low agreement provided for settlement of the compensatory and punitive damage phases of the trial,"" said Lilly spokesman Edward West Wednesday in a telephone interview.  
That acknowledgment allowed Potter to amend the Wesbecker verdict to say the case was ""dismissed as settled"" -- a legal intricacy he and Lilly have wrangled over since 1994.
""After nearly two-and-a-half years of this, we and the plaintiffs said to (Potter) Monday ... enter your corrected judgment. If that's what you think you need to do to be at peace with this matter, then do that,"" West said. ""It's time to put this matter to rest ... We have nothing to hide.""  
Wall Street considers the disputed deal that ended the Wesbecker case a non-event. Analysts said major drug companies often pay plaintiffs ""hush money"" in liability cases, but Lilly has fought any revelations by Potter's court about the company's arrangement with the Wesbecker plaintiffs.
""There is a confidentiality agreement in place ... We've honored that,"" West said.
In 1989, while on Prozac and other drugs, 47-year-old Joseph Wesbecker walked into his former workplace in Louisville with an AK-47 assault rifle and went on a shooting rampage.  
He killed eight people, wounded 12, and then committed suicide.
Survivors of the Standard Gravure Printing plant massacre and victims' families sued Lilly for $50 million, alleging that Prozac drove Wesbecker to his horrible end. A flood of more than 160 similar legal actions followed and Prozac came under national legal and scientific scrutiny.
Potter presided over the 47-day Wesbecker lawsuit trial in late 1994 and early 1995.  
The jury found Lilly not liable in the case and Potter dismissed it. But in April 1995, he had second thoughts because he said he suspected the case had been secretly settled out of court. He filed a motion that the verdict be changed to say that the case was ""dismissed as settled.""
Lilly fought the motion, but the Kentucky Supreme Court ordered Potter to look into the matter because, the court said, it suspected ""there may have been deception, bad faith conduct, abuse of the judicial process or perhaps even fraud.""  
An investigation was conducted by a lawyer for the Kentucky attorney general's office. The probe revealed the nature and cost of the pre-verdict agreement that Lilly has since acknowledged making. But many of the facts surrounding the agreement, including its price-tag, remain under wraps.
Potter declined to comment Tuesday on the objectives of the hearing he hopes to convene.
West said, ""Judge Potter ... has stated on the record he intends to release the aggregate amount of the agreement.""
To this day, Lilly defends Prozac as safe and has been backed by panels of medical experts. Until this week, the company also contended it had never lost or settled any of the Prozac court cases. Despite the settlement of the damages phase of the Wesbecker trial, West said, the fact remains that the jury cleared Lilly on the question of liability.
""They heard everything about Prozac and decided that the product had nothing to do with Wesbecker's actions,"" he said.

4223,"St. Jude Medical Inc's proposed $505 million stock acquisition of Ventritex Inc will likely proceed, said chief financial officer Stephen Wilson.
In an interview Thursday with Reuters, Wilson discussed the company's duty to look into the three recent deaths of patients implanted with Ventritex medical devices.
But he said that, as serious as the deaths are, ""It's not the kind of thing that results in St. Jude Medical not wanting to move forward with the transaction.""
Shares in St. Jude were up 3/8 to 36-7/8.  
""So many good things have been put in place and we did work very hard and very long to make that happen. It really would be, in my view, very unfortunate if this transaction didn't move forward,"" he said.
Ventritex last week confirmed the death of a third recipient of one of its implantable defibrillators, devices that regulate heartbeat. Wilson gave Ventritex high marks on handling the problem so far and said St. Jude intends to get a full understanding of the situation.
""What we don't think makes any sense is for us to be breathing over their backs,"" Wilson said.  
He declined to comment on Wall Street speculation that the transaction price might be renegotiated down.
""Clearly, we do need to go in and do some due diligence so that we understand whether or not there has been any impact on the franchise value,"" he said.
He estimated that federal regulatory review of the deal may take another three to four weeks.
""In the best set of circumstances, at this point, we might get a first-quarter closing. If not, then hopefully we get an early second-quarter closing,"" he said.
Shares in Ventritex were up one to 19.  
Concerning St. Jude's additional analysis of the impact on the deal of the deaths, Wilson said: ""One of the things that we'll do is talk to some of the physician customers out there to see how they feel about the way it was handled. Then, most importantly, how they feel about Ventritex and its products moving forward. That's the real key question.""
He said St. Jude has not set a date to start additional due diligence, but is in close contact with Ventritex. He added that St. Jude expects to see sales of more than $1 billion in 1997.
""Even without Ventritex, we will exceed $1 billion,"" Wilson said.

4224,"Pier 1 Imports is targeting earnings growth this year near the high end of its annual objective of 15 to 18 percent over the life of a five-year business plan, Chief Executive Clark Johnson said Wednesday.
""The Street has got us up toward the higher end of that range and I think we have an internal goal to do better than that, but that's an internal goal and it's not a forecast,"" Johnson told Reuters in an interview after a presentation to investors at a Raymond James conference here.  
Raymond James projects the retailer will report fiscal 1997 earnings of $1.25 per share, up 19 percent from $1.05 for fiscal 1996 ended February 28.
Johnson said Pier 1 projects sales this year will rise about $100 million. The company, which has 725 stores in North America plus joint ventures in England, Mexico and Japan, posted fiscal 1996 sales of $944.6 million.
He said the company will open 53 stores this year and close about 25. Remodeling and remerchandising of store layouts is also under way throughout much of the chain, reflecting a change in product lines, he said.  
At the end of its fiscal year last month, Pier 1 stopped selling apparel. It is beefing up its home furnishings offerings in response to what it sees as changing consumer attitudes. ""The Martha Stewart syndrome is alive and well in America,"" Johnson said.
""There's been a shift in consumer spending away from apparel, and even in this past holiday season away from consumer electronics and toward home furnishings,"" he said.
Pier 1 is also launching a bridal registry program that Johnson said is expected to take further advantage of the trend toward higher sales of furniture, fixtures and other items for the home.
The company operates a joint venture in England called ""The Pier."" Johnson said it is expected to break even this year after losing money last year.
He said expansion in Japan continues. ""We think it's possible to eventually have about 200 stores in Japan,"" he said.

4227,"MGI Pharma Inc is reorienting its marketing efforts for Salagen, a drug for dry mouth in head and neck cancer patients, but it's still unable to predict when the company will turn a profit.
In an interview with Reuters, chief executive Charles Blitzer said Salagen is growing slowly. ""There's a lot we're learning about Salagen that we didn't understand back when it was being touted as a $100-million product,"" he said.
On the job since April, Blitzer said he is revamping the sales effort for the drug, which stimulates salivation.  
The Minnetonka, Minn.-based company has yet to post a sustainable profit. It lost $0.18 per share in 1995 and $0.82 per share in 1994. Dain Bosworth projects a loss of $0.34 per share this year and $0.15 per share in 1997.
""There's a question about whether we can be profitable in a sustained way in 1997,"" said chief financial officer James Adam.
The new strategy, bolstered by research data, encourages use of the drug during radiation treatments for head and neck cancer, rather than after treatment to relieve dry mouth, or xerostomia. A new sales force has been trained and fielded.  
""We're going to continue to make a steady and slow, but sure, impact in the head and neck cancer arena,"" Blitzer said.
Dain Bosworth last week lowered its estimate of the annual market for Salagen to $10-$12 million from $75 million. The firm cut its consolidated revenue estimate for MGI to $9.1 million for 1996 from $10.5 million, and to $12.4 million for 1997 from $22.4 million. Revenues were $13.3 million in 1995.
The company still expects to file a supplemental new drug application in the fourth quarter with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration seeking clearance to sell Salagen as a treatment for Sjogren's Syndrome, Blitzer said.  
Sjogren's is an autoimmune disease that damages the salivary glands and most commonly affects post-menopausal women. The target population for the disorder numbers about 400,000 patients, compared to about 25,000 for xerostomia.
Data from completed clinical trials for Sjogren's may also indicate Salagen can relieve dry eye, or kerato conjunctivitis seca, with a target population of 10 million, Blitzer said. Salagen sales in the second quarter were $1.46 million, up 75 percent over the year-ago level.
Aside from Salagen, MGI continues to develop some anti-cancer compounds. Renewed attention was drawn to one, MGI 114, in July when the National Cancer Institute voted to fund a series of trials with it, he said.
MGI on Monday completed a secondary, 1.2 million-share stock offering that yielded proceeds of $5.6 million to be devoted to ""late-stage in-licensing opportunities"" of promising anti-cancer compounds, Blitzer said.
MGI shares were up 1/8 at 5-1/4 Tuesday. In mid-1994, they traded as high as 11.

4229,"The board of directors of WMX Technologies Inc. Wednesday rallied around its Chief Executive Phillip Rooney following a direct attack on his leadership by a major stockholder.
An investment group led by financier George Soros called Tuesday for Rooney's ouster and proposed a slate of nominees for the board of the largest U.S. garbage-hauling company.
In response, the WMX board said it ""unanimously reaffirmed its support for Phillip B. Rooney and his leadership of the company during his seven months as chief executive officer.""
The exchange did little but aggravate the acrimonious struggle involving WMX, Soros and other large shareholders.
""I don't think they could really escalate the animosity any higher than it already is,"" said James Kelleher, industry analyst at the Argus Research firm in New York.
The New York-based Soros group and other investors, including the Lens Fund in Washington, D.C., have been pressuring WMX to improve its performance for months.
WMX, based in Oak Brook, Ill., said last week that it was cutting 3,000 jobs and shedding $1.5 billion in assets in a broad effort to refocus on its core waste management business.
On Tuesday, the Soros group expressed dissatisfaction with the restructuring plan, proposed removing Rooney and named four individuals to its alternate slate of board nominees.
Even with a 5.2-percent stake in WMX, the Soros group cannot dictate the company's future, especially in the face of widespread small shareholder scepticism about the large shareholders' motives.
""They can make a lot of noise and smoke, but when everything is done, their effectiveness is limited ... This thing is far from over,"" Kelleher said.
WMX last week reported a fourth-quarter loss of $461 million after charges, vs. a profit in the year-ago period of $49.6 million. It  reported revenues for all of 1996 of $9.18 billion, compared with $9.05 billion in 1995.
WMX said Wednesday that the board nominees do not qualify for consideration at the company's annual meeting this year.
""The documents we received from the Soros group attempting to nominate four individuals for election as directors of the company arrived after the filing deadline and contained incomplete information,"" WMX said in a statement.
WMX added that its board was committed to search for the best possible candidates and its nominating committee had agreed to consider the Soros nominees later this year.
""Our board is absolutely committed to attracting the best directors possible. We want to make sure we are serving the interests of all of our stockholders,"" WMX said.
If Soros does not prevail before or during the WMX annual meeting scheduled for early May, time may be on his side.
""WMX is far from out of the woods and is likely going to have a few more painful quarters, which will strengthen Soros' hand so that he might succeed next time,"" Kelleher said.
The WMX board said that Rooney, a long-time manager of the company's waste management business, was the right leader for the company as it concentrates on that industry.
WMX also said an important component of its restructuring plan was adding new, independent perspectives to its board and reiterated it had hired an executive recruiting firm to find appropriate candidates.
WMX's stock, which fell 9 percent last week, was up 50 cents at $32.75 in heavy volume on the New York Stock Exchange.

4235,"St. Jude Medical Inc said Thursday it will do more analysis of its proposed purchase of Ventritex Inc because of the deaths of three recipients of heartbeat-regulating devices made by Ventritex.
""With a product quality issue like this, obviously it causes additional analysis to be done and we're involved in doing that,"" St. Jude spokesman Peter Gove told Reuters.
""Based on what we know today, we are moving forward"" with the acquisition,"" Gove said. ""But we are going to do, as you might expect, additional due diligence.""  
At the same time, Ventritex general counsel Mark Meltzer confirmed that a third patient implanted with a Ventritex implantable defibrillator died on January 22.
The company was notified a day or two later and it promptly advised the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, he said. The identity of the patient is not being disclosed.
""I can say that it's not a different kind of problem. It is the problem which is being addressed by reprogramming. Unfortunately this death occured before the patient could be reprogrammed,"" Meltzer said.  
An FDA spokeswoman said the agency is investigating.
On January 16, Ventritex said it had been authorized by the FDA to begin reprogramming 5,605 implantable defibrillators implanted in living patients. The company said then that component failures in the devices were believed to be associated with the deaths of two patients.
Shares in Ventritex fell 1-1/4 to 18-1/8 in heavy trading Thursday on speculation about the death and its possible impact on the proposed $505-million St. Jude-Ventritex deal.
""The market is speculating that St. Jude might attempt to reprice the transaction,"" said Piper Jaffray medical technology analyst Arch Smith.
St. Jude was advised by Ventritex of the third death, Gove said. ""We've kept in very close contact with them through this whole thing,"" he said.
Meltzer said substantial progress has been made in Ventritex's efforts to find the patients who carry the 5,605 implantable defibrillators that need to be reprogrammed. He said he was unaware of any change in the St. Jude deal.
""We are basically where we were when the first two indicents were exposed,"" Gove said.
""We are working very closely with Ventritex. We think they're handling this as responsibly as they can ... We certainly wouldn't rule out continued discussion with them. We'll have an opportunity to sit down with them once they've determined the extent of the situation,"" Gove said.

The price was far lower than analysts following the company said they had hoped Quaker would be able to get.
""It was a fire-sale price.  I'd been using $600 to $700 million"" as an estimated value for Snapple, said Prudential Securities food industry analyst John McMillin.
At the same time, analysts said they were relieved that Quaker was ending its disastrous Snapple venture.  
""The monkey is finally off Quaker Oats' back,"" said BT Securities food industry analyst John O'Neil.
Shares in Quaker were up 3/8 to 37-7/8 in late morning on heavy volume, after trading as high as 39-1/2.  Shares in Triarc Cos Inc, which is buying the Snapple line from Quaker, were up one to 16-3/4 after trading as high as 18.
Triarc owns the Mistic and Royal Crown beverage lines, as well as Arby's Inc fast-food restaurants and liquefied petroleum and specialty dyes and chemicals businesses.  
Chicago-based Quaker bought Snapple for $1.8 billion, including acquisition costs, two-and-a-half years ago near the height of the alternative beverage brand's popularity.
Since the purchase, widely seen by analysts as overvalued, Quaker has struggled with the line of ready-to-drink teas and juices.  Snapple sales declined eight percent in the United States and Canada in 1996, and the business ran at a cash loss, the company reported last month.
""The bad news is the (Snapple) investment's been a disaster; the good news is they're trying to put it behind them,"" McMillin said.
Quaker's other products include Gatorade, which continues to dominate the sports drink market, and cereals, such as Quaker oatmeals, Cap'n Crunch and Life.

""The nursing home industry, in general, is ripe for consolidation. It wouldn't surprise me if there were more of these types of transactions,"" said Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette healthcare industry analyst John Hindelong.
Shares in TheraTx closed up 3-1/2 to 16-5/8, below the $17.10 per share cash offer from Louisville, Ky.-based Vencor.  
Analysts said shares in Alpharetta, Ga.-based Vencor failed to trade up to the offer on unjustified worries about the 60- to 90-day projected wait until closing.
""The deal is basically done. There's not a lot of risk here. It's a great arbitrage play,"" said Dean Witter analyst Scott Mackesy.
Vencor and TheraTx said jointly Monday that their merger was approved by both boards of directors. Vencor said it expects to begin its tender offer on February 14. The deal is expected to close within 90 days, the companies said.
Vencor shares closed unchanged at 32-1/2.  
Buying TheraTx -- for $354 million in cash, about $100 million for outstanding convertible securities and debt assumption -- will add a key element to Vencor's line.
""This will make Vencor the only company out there that can offer the long-term care hospital, the nursing home and the contract services,"" said D.A. Davidson analyst Robert Thornburg.
Vencor is the largest U.S. long-term care hospital company. It also has sub-acute care units, nursing homes and specialty care centers for respiratory therapy.  
Last spring, Vencor served notice of its intentions to be a major player by acquiring Hillhaven Corp HIL.N for $1.9 billion.
""Vencor wants very much to be big and this makes them bigger,"" Hindelong said of the TheraTx deal. ""It's probably not the last major acquisition that they'll make.""
Analysts said Vencor expects the deal to be accretive to earnings in the second half of 1997.
Public since 1994, TheraTx operates 29 nursing homes and sells rehabilitation services under contract to dozens of other nursing home companies.  
Like others in the field, its stock for months has been weighed down by uncertainty about the U.S. Health Care Financing Administration's rewrite of Medicare reimbursement rules for such services.
""It was just a cloud hanging over their heads. So there was a lot of incentive on the part of (TheraTx chief executive) John Bardis to go out and do something like this,"" said Arneson Kercheville analyst Jay Somaney.
Given its recent history of market perception problems, TheraTx is getting a good price at $17.10, analysts said.
""I think it's a pretty good valuation,"" said Robertson Stephens analyst Sheryl Skolnick. ""Truth be told, earnings estimates have been drifting downward and analyst support for the stock has been drifting away.""
She added that one potential winner in the deal could be NovaCare Inc, of King of Prussia, Pa.
""Novacare will be the only one left that will be seen as independent of a competitor by the free-standing nursing home or small chains out there...It leaves you with one independent player who will gain market share,"" Skolnick said.

4244,"Humana Inc. reported lower quarterly profits Tuesday, mainly due to charges for restructuring, but the stock in the big health maintenance organisation rose on optimism over its new president's ambitious turnaround plan.
The 4.9-million member HMO -- fifth largest in the United States among for-profit HMOs -- posted fourth-quarter net income of $22 million, or 13 cents a share, after charges, down from $49 million, or 30 cents a share, in the 1995 quarter.
Quarterly premium revenues were $1.81 billion, up from $1.49 billion in the year-ago period.
For the full year, Humana said net income plunged 94 percent to $12 million, or 7 cents a share, from $190 million, or $1.17 a share. The company reported revenues of $6.7 billion, up from $4.6 billion in 1995.
The stock of the Louisville, Ky.-based Humana rose 37.5 cents to $18.75 on the New York Stock Exchange after rising as high as $19.25.
""What the stock is responding to is Humana's outlining a pretty aggressive action plan. ... They're making the organisation more lean and mean,"" said Gary Frazier, a health care industry analyst with the Bear Sterns brokerage.
When Gregory Wolf became president of Humana in September, he took over a company that once had led the managed health care industry, but had more recently seen its star fade as it expanded into unprofitable areas.
Wolf had previously been president of Emphesys Financial Group Inc., which Humana acquired in October 1995.
With the help of a new executive staff, Wolf is pushing through a tough plan to cut costs and withdraw Humana from money-losing markets.
""He's made some very intelligent moves,"" said Ed Keaney, health-care industry analyst with the Volpe Welty brokerage.
In the fourth quarter, Humana took a special charge against earnings of $10 million after taxes related mainly to severance costs for elimination of 700 to 900 jobs this year from its roughly 18,000-member work force.
The company has sold or is selling money-losing operations in Alabama, Washington, D.C., and other markets.
In the second quarter, Humana took a special charge against earnings of $130 million after taxes to restructure the Washington health plan, provide for expected insurance losses, close 13 service areas and discontinue unprofitable products in three markets.
As a result, the company said total enrollment in its commercial health care plans fell by 69,100 members last year, by 87,500 members in January alone and is expected to decline by 115,000 members this quarter.
""Our plans to withdraw from certain markets and price business commensurate with the underlying risk are proceeding on schedule,"" Wolf said.
The company's medical-loss ratio -- a key measure of profitability -- improved to 82.8 percent in the fourth quarter from 83.1 percent in the third quarter, but was up from 81.5 percent in the year-ago period.
Analysts said they were impressed with Wolf's plan for reversing Humana's fortunes but noted the company unveiled a turnaround plan once before that was never fully achieved.
""I want to see a little more of a turn in earnings before I'm sure this action plan is taking hold,"" Frazier said.

4252,"China on Wednesday told U.S. President Bill Clinton not to worry about Chinese human rights and Hong Kong's future freedoms, saying Beijing's rights record spoke for itself and liberty in the British colony was assured.
Clinton said on Tuesday that Washington had made less progress than hoped in influencing Chinese rights policies and warned that Hong Kong's value to China might fall if liberties in the colony were lost after it returns to Beijing's rule.
""The national conditions of China and the United States are not the same and it is natural for different views on human rights to exist,"" said a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman in reaction to Clinton's comments.
The reaction -- exceedingly mild by Beijing's standards -- came as Chinese and U.S. officials met in the capital to discuss trade and human rights, issues that have long dogged the cross-Pacific relationship.
In its report on Clinton's remarks, China's official Xinhua news agency mentioned only the U.S. president's defence of his engagement policy towards China, and said nothing of his comment that liberty's advance in the authoritarian communist nation was inevitable.
Analysts said Beijing was determined to keep up the momentum of a recent Sino-U.S. rapprochement and would not allow it to be derailed by Clinton's remarks on Hong Kong and human rights.
Concerns over the future of the British colony, which reverts to China at midnight on June 30, were unfounded, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said.
China had guaranteed freedom for Hong Kong's people with its mini-constitution for the territory, the Basic Law, she said.
""Under the Basic Law the people of Hong Kong have full freedom and all democratic rights,"" she said. ""There is no basis or need for doubt or concern about this.""
China's own constitution and laws protected the rights of members of all its nationalities, she said.
""The efforts and achievements made by the Chinese government in this area are there for all to see,"" she said. ""Anyone who is not biased will reach a fair conclusion.""
A U.S. delegation arrived in Beijing on Tuesday for talks on human rights with Chinese officials, after a year in which almost all remaining members of the nation's tiny pro-democracy movement were either imprisoned or driven into exile.
The delegation was seeking concessions that could make it unnecessary this year for Washington to sponsor a U.N. resolution faulting China's rights policy, U.S. officials said.
A Western diplomat in Beijing said the delegation's arrival was a sign of Chinese and U.S. determination to bolster the recent warming in ties that has helped soften the impact of disputes over issues ranging from Taiwan to copyright piracy.
However, the delegation was unlikely to extract sufficient clear concessions from Beijing to make it politically viable for Clinton not to sponsor a critical resolution at the U.N. Human Rights Commission in March, the diplomat said.
Talks on issues such as human rights should take overall ties into account and should be carried out on a basis of equality, the Chinese spokeswoman said.

4257,"China said Monday that it restrained inflation while maintaining strong economic growth in 1996 and it predicted it will do even better next year despite soaring government-sector losses and slumping individual incomes.
The State Statistical Bureau quoted preliminary 1996 figures showing China's gross domestic product grew at an estimated 9.7 percent to 6.8 trilliion yuan ($816 billion) while inflation fell to 6.0 percent from 14.8 percent.
Despite soaring losses in the state sector and falling incomes for many urban households, the statistics showed China's economy had returned safely to earth after a period of high inflation and runaway growth, bureau spokesman Ye Zhen said.
""The national economy maintained its rapid and stable growth, indicating a successful 'soft landing,'"" Ye told a news conference in Beijing.
China will do even better in 1997, he said.
""Preliminary estimates show overall growth will continue with the same stability and high speed as this year,"" he said.
Annual economic growth in 1997 was expected to rise to 10.5 percent, while inflation -- which soared to a communist-era high of 21.4 percent in 1994 -- will stay at this year's level, Ye said.
China has set a target of 8.0 percent growth for 1996 to try to cool the economy, down from 10.2 percent last year and a sizzling 11.8 percent the previous year.
The 6.0 percent figure for 1996 retail price inflation, China's benchmark price index, was well below the government's 10 percent target for the year.
Consumer price inflation was estimated at about 8.3 percent, compared with 17.1 percent in 1995.
While some economists have expressed doubts about the accuracy of Beijing's inflation figures, it was clear that once-fierce price rises have been largely controlled, said Jason Kwok, chief economist at Citibank Hong Kong and China.
""It all tends to suggest that the macroeconomy is doing very well this year,"" Kwok said in a telephone interview.
Two recent interest rate cuts and China's second-half turnaround of an earlier poor export performance meant growth could edge up next year even without a loosening of Beijing's 42-month-old tight credit policy, Kwok said.
Stable growth next year was likely to receive an external boost from an expected upward trend in exports, which the statistical bureau said had powered China to an estimated $16 billion trade surplus in 1996, he said.
Beijing will keep the lid on credit growth and continue to put high priority on restraining price rises, Ye said.

4269,"A Chinese dissident who spent years in jail after the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing has sent a rare open letter to parliament calling for legislation to hold back a rising tide of official corruption.
Former magazine editor and historian Bao Zunxin said he had written to the National People's Congress, or parliament, last week to push for tougher anti-corruption laws.
Legislation was needed to force more openness and fuller disclosure of officials' private assets and existing laws were inadequate to cope with endemic graft, the 58-year-old dissident said in a telephone interview.
""Without an end to corruption, there will not be a day of peace in our country,"" Bao wrote in his letter, a copy of which was faxed to news agencies by the Information Centre of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China.
""Corruption has seeped into every level of the government, and requiring only officials above the county level to declare their property is far from enough,"" he wrote.
Petitions to parliament, always a risky venture for China's tiny band of dissidents, have in the past been either greeted with stony silence or followed by the detention of signatories.
Bao, who spent more than three years in prison for his role in the 1989 Tiananmen Square demonstrations that were bloodily crushed by the army, said he could not guess what the reaction to his letter would be but it was impossible to be optimistic.
Public security officials took Bao from his Beijing home in July for a week-long ""tour"" to Qingdao in eastern China after discovering he had granted an interview to a French reporter, he said.
Some dissidents see demands for action against corruption as a rallying call that can strike a chord among a populace bitter at the wealth and privilege enjoyed by some senior officials.
Anger at leaders and bureaucrats who use their power to amass wealth in China's new market economy helped send hundreds of thousands of Beijing residents into the streets in support of the 1989 student-led demonstrations in Tiananmen Square.
Many Chinese say graft has since spread even more as economic reforms continue to weaken social controls and multiply profit-making opportunities for those with political clout.
Bao's open letter follows a July appeal to parliament from leading dissident Liu Xiaobo for speedy legislation to curb corruption in the state media and to loosen the ruling Communist Party's monopoly on news.
Beijing has repeatedly declared war on graft, calling it a scourge that threatens the very basis of communist rule, but many Chinese say the campaigns have had only limited success.
Short-term actions such as the on-going ""Strike Hard"" anti-crime campaign were not enough to clean up China's government, Bao wrote in his letter to parliament.
""Corruption, especially systemic and all-pervasive corruption as in China, cannot be stopped with a short period of ""Striking Hard',"" he wrote.
""An effective system of (property) declaration should be made available to the public through legislation, and should have legal authority, openness, transparency and supervisory mechanism,"" he wrote.

4270,"China's lumbering state firms are putting more effort into making products they can actually sell, but huge stockpiles of unwanted goods remain a blot on the economic landscape, officials said on Monday.
At the end of October the total amount of capital tied up in inventories of 380,000 enterprises across China had reached 540 billion yuan ($65 billion), 80 billion yuan more than at the beginning of 1996, State Statistical Bureau spokesman Ye Zhen said.
While some of the inventories were a result of normal production and marketing processes, much was ""unreasonable"", Ye told a news conference.
""Of the total 540 billion yuan in stocks, 150 billion yuan is unreasonable,"" he said but gave no details.
Many state-owned firms, long accustomed to mass-production for a command economy, have struggled to adjust to China's new consumer-led markets and continue to churn out millions of yuan worth of unsellable goods.
State media reported last week that excessive investment by enterprises in some industries had resulted in mountains of warehoused goods ranging from bicycles to wristwatches.
The stockpiles included about 1.5 billion unsold men's shirts -- about three shirts for every adult Chinese male.
Chinese officials say concentration of investment in certain industries has led to cut-throat competition resulting in losses, monopolies and local protectionism.
Beijing has vowed to curb blind investment by provinces in some industries, but economists say defiance from regional authorities will hamper the central government's efforts.
Ye said firms had progressively improved the quality of their investment in new production throughout 1996.
""Enterprises... are paying more attention to efficiency and to the quality and variety of their products,"" he said. ""Blind production has been reduced.""
The national sales rate for industrial products had risen to 96.27 percent in November from 93.04 percent in the first quarter, he said.
Large stockpiles held by state enterprises have compounded their difficulties in clearing interlocking ""triangular debt"" among firms unable to pay their bills to one another.
The value of ""outstanding accounts"", or funds owed, by 380,000 state firms had soared to 900 billion yuan by the end of October, up 100 billion yuan from the start of the year, Ye said.
He said state statisticians believed about one-third of the 900 billion yuan in debt was ""unreasonable"", apparently hinting that this might not be repayable.

4277,"Chinese President Jiang Zemin on Wednesday greeted future Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa with a pledge of support and a vow not to tread on Hong Kong's right to autonomy after the British colony returns to Beijing rule.
The appointment of the tycoon who will lead Hong Kong from July 1 next year marked the dawn of new age, Jiang told reporters during a meeting with Tung in Beijing's Great Hall of the People.
""Of course, I will support him,"" Jiang told reporters. ""This is indeed the start of a new era.""
Tung, a shipping magnate who will become Hong Kong's first Chinese chief executive after more than 150 years of colonial rule by London, was in Beijing to meet leaders after his formal appointment on Monday by Premier Li Peng.
Jiang assured Tung that Beijing would stand by the terms of its Basic Law, which gives the territory a large degree of autonomy as a Special Administrative Region of China, the official Xinhua news agency said.
""In dealing with the question of Hong Kong we will strictly act in accordance with the Basic Law, and will never interfere in affairs belonging to the scope of autonomy of the Special Administrative Region,"" Xinhua quoted Jiang as saying.
Tung's first visit to Beijing since his appointment is being closely watched by Hong Kong residents keen to know more about his plans for the post-colonial adminstration and to learn whether current senior civil servants will keep their jobs.
Tung, who has urged Hong Kong's people to be sensitive to China's sovereign rights, has yet to give details of his plans for the post-colonial administration but has said he will discuss transition issues during the visit.
While China has said it will leave Hong Kong's free-wheeling capitalist system intact, it has made clear that the territory's leader's authority will have limits.
One of Tung's first tasks in the twilight of British rule will be to put together an advisory cabinet called the Executive Council and to decide which senior civil servants to keep -- a subject of much speculation among Hong Kong's boisterous media.
While interest has focused on Tung's intentions for current senior administrators, China said on Tuesday that it would make the final decision on important civil servants.
""For senior officials, they need the nomination of the top administrative official and to finally obtain appointment by the central government,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told a news briefing.
Jiang, who in January signalled that the tycoon was China's favourite for chief executive by singling him out for a warm handshake at a reception, said China would stand by to assist if the tycoon ran into problems.
""If the chief executive needs help from the central government when he meets with difficulties, the central government will be bound to render full support,"" he said.
China has hailed Tung's appointment as the fruit of its principle of Hong Kong autonomy, but the selection process was dogged by protests from democrats who accuse Beijing of using a hand-picked committee to stage-manage the choice.
Beijing's critics believe it is likely try to control Hong Kong and its 6.3 million people from behind the scenes after the five-star Chinese flag is raised over the territory.

4280,"China and the United States signed a new textile agreement on Sunday in an eleventh-hour deal that ended the threat of a cross-Pacific trade war and was hailed by both sides as a breakthrough.
U.S. officials said their main achievement was gaining assured access for the first time to Chinese textile markets, adding that it also granted China a U.S. import quota slightly larger than the previous 1994 textile pact.
Millions of dollars in penalties slapped by Washington on Chinese imports remained in force under the deal, although Beijing had agreed to withdraw its threat of retaliation, top U.S. textile negotiator Rita Hayes said after the signing.
""For the first time the United States has market access with China... and this is something we felt very strongly about,"" Hayes told reporters. ""It is now a situation that we have a level playing field.""
The four-year textile accord was signed by Hayes and Li Dongsheng, China's chief negotiator and director of the trade management department of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
Officials of both sides welcomed the deal, which was hammered out during negotiations that ran far beyond their original three-day schedule to become a gruelling six-day marathon topped by all-night sessions.
""After six days of hard work, the delegations have reached a rather ideal conclusion,"" said Chinese Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi, who attended the signing ceremony.
Officials of both sides declined to give details of the accord, but Hayes said it would create U.S. jobs by allowing exports while slightly increasing China's U.S. import quota.
The talks focused on renewal of the 1994 textile accord and resolution of a dispute over U.S. penalties on Chinese exports, with market access for U.S. goods to China also a major stumbling block, officials said.
Breakthrough came during a one-day extension to the final deadline for renewal of the Sino-U.S. accord, which had originally been scheduled to expire on December 31 but was extended by one month to allow time to reach a compromise.
""I think this morning at the beginning we were unhappy with each other, but now we have become friends,"" U.S. negotiator Li told Hayes during the signing of the accord.
The accord ended the threat of a Sino-U.S. trade war, which had loomed after Washington slapped $19 million in penalties on Chinese imports last September, accusing Beijing of shipping textiles through third countries to evade quota restrictions.
China had threatened to retaliate by temporarily banning imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods and alcoholic drinks but delayed the action to allow time for further talks.
After the signing of the textile accord, Beijing announced it was calling off its retaliatory measures, but U.S. negotiator Hayes said Washington's penalties remained in force.
""The transshipment charges that were made in September still stand as they did,"" she said without elaborating.
Access to China's huge and growing markets was also an issue in other Sino-U.S. meetings in Beijing last week.
U.S. trade official Lee Sands held two days of talks in the Chinese capital to discuss China's delayed accession to the World Trade Organisation, long a source of bilateral friction.
""The agreement is once again proof that China and the United States can settle their trade disputes through negotiations based on equality and mutual benefits,"" said negotiator Li.

4283,"A state-sponsored group of Chinese academics has slammed a U.S. report that criticises Beijing for silencing dissent as a malicious and slanderous interference in China's internal affairs, official media said on Thursday.
The U.S. State Department 1997 report had violated the principles of the United Nations and ignored the progress China had made in protecting human rights, the official People's Daily quoted the scholars as concluding at a seminar in Beijing.
""The report is full of groundless accusations and intentional fabrications,"" the newspaper, mouthpiece of China's Communist Party, quoted Tian Dan of the China Society for the Study of Human Rights as saying.
""The United States government always 'reheats cold food', misleads public opinion and hopes to repeat its lies so often that they become true,"" Tian said.
The scholars' attack, which was carried by all major newspapers, was the first clear sign of Chinese anger at the January 30 U.S. report, which criticised Beijing for abusing basic freedoms and for wiping out overt political dissent.
China, which is eager to keep the momentum of the recent rapid warming in long-strained Sino-U.S. ties and has reacted with rare restraint to U.S. recent rights concerns, has yet to issue an official response to the State Department report.
All active Chinese dissidents had been jailed, detained or driven into exile in 1996, although there had been some widening of freedoms outside the political arena, the U.S. report said.
Both Washington and Beijing say relations have improved dramatically in recent months after two years of disputes over issues ranging from human rights to Taiwan to trade.
China's initially mild reaction to the U.S. report was a positive sign, but Beijing took 23 days to react to a similarily critical report last year and then unleashed a 7,000-word tirade that blasted Washington, a Western diplomat said on Thursday.
Such a diplomatic broadside could still emerge to rock ties this year, but it was unlikely to be quite as long, he said.
China's official Xinhua news agency quoted the scholars' seminar as saying the U.S. report's ""malicious and slanderous"" attack on Beijing's rights record had exposed its real aim of using the issue as an excuse to interfere in China's affairs.
The evidence provided in the report was mainly based on Western media reports, the statements of overseas pro-democracy activists and distortions of speeches of Chinese officials, Xinhua said.
Criticism over individual cases raised by Washington was factually wrong, it quoted the experts in rights, philosophy, history, law, social sciences and journalism as concluding.
The Chinese constitution had more articles on human rights protection than did the United States, while the U.S. judicial system lagged far behind in cracking down on crime and safeguarding citizens' freedoms, said Professor Dong Yunhu of the Chinese Communist Party's central academy.
""The U.S. government is not qualified to find fault with China in this respect,"" he said.
International human rights activists have long criticised China for its harsh treatment of dissent, its widespread of administrative detention without trial and its enthusiasm for executions as a means to deter rising crime.
Analysts say human rights will continue to be a major irritant in sensitive Sino-U.S. ties, despite attempts by both Washington and Beijing to ensure that the issue is not allowed to derail their recent rapprochement.

4289,"China's war on destitution has been filling the pages of the state-controlled media, but the nation has little chance of meeting its target of wiping out absolute poverty by 2000, analysts said on Wednesday.
A week of banner headlines and front-page stories trumpeting the anti-poverty resolve of China's communist leadership reflected more the political importance of impoverished regions than real confidence targets could be achieved, they said.
Bringing new wealth to the 65 million Chinese struggling to survive with annual incomes below the 530 yuan ($64) official absolute poverty line was a vital state goal, state media said.
""We know that it's not particularly realistic. You can't just wave a wand and suddenly all these people just disappear,"" said a Western diplomat who specialises in poverty issues.
""They have had really good progress in the last five years but they haven't reached those targets -- and there doesn't seem to be a great deal of momentum built up to be able to meet those targets,"" the diplomat said.
State newspapers have packed their pages this week with months-old speeches and state resolutions, mixed with more recent reports of regional successes in easing the scourge of poverty in the nation's villages.
""Before the 21st century arrives, China will eliminate absolute poverty... The Chinese Communist Party will lead the people of the whole nation to cast off the stigma of destitution,"" said the Xinhua Daily Telegraph.
But in a commentary that accompanied the text of an October resolution on poverty, the official newspaper also appeared to reflect concern that high profile goals could be hard to meet.
China had been able to lift only an average of five million people a year from poverty over the last three years, less than half the targeted level, it said.
""If the pace of poverty alleviation in poor areas is not accelerated, that will mean the problem of feeding and sheltering around 40 million poor people will be carried into the next century,"" it said.
Even if all Chinese could be assured an annual income above the official absolute poverty line, the gap between China's urban haves and rural have-nots would linger for many years, said a Chinese agricultural development analyst.
""There is a lot of work to be done,"" he said, adding that poverty remained an issue in the areas around some of China's most prosperous eastern and coastal cities.
""Even in Beijing suburbs there are mountainous areas where the average income is still low,"" he said. ""They are not poor by national standards but they are still far behind (urban residents).""
The Western diplomat said one reason for the high profile accorded to anti-poverty pledges by senior leaders such as President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng was the need to placate local leaders in more backward regions.
China's inland provinces have long complained they are being left behind by booming coastal regions, prompting promises of a westward shift in investment to help them to catch up.
""On the political level I think (the publicity) is closely related to the issue of building up the western and central provinces,"" the diplomat said.
It was unclear what the political results of failure to reach the targets would be, she said.

4293,"Tsingtao Brewery built its reputation as China's king of beers earlier this century by catering to thirsty foreign invaders.
But analysts warn that after years at the top, a complacent Tsingtao today is seeing a new breed of invader -- this time in the form of nimble foreign beer makers -- eat into its once-impregnable market share.
The brewery in eastern China's Shandong province, which in 1993 became the first Chinese company to list on the Hong Kong stock exchange has ""rested on their laurels for too long"", said one Beijing-based beer industry analyst.
While Tsingtao has begun to respond to the threat from foreign-funded joint ventures and upstart domestic brewing groups, it still relies too much on its traditional brand-name prestige and is being out-advertised by thirstier rivals, he said.
Company officials at the brewery's home in the scenic port city of Qingdao -- formerly Romanised as Tsingtao -- say they feel the pressure but are ready to fight back.
""We don't feel there is a crisis,"" said general manager Peng Zuoyi, the head of a new management team appointed earlier this year to boost the brewery's prospects.
Tsingtao plans to boost production to 500,000 tonnes this year, from 350,000 tonnes in 1995, and hike annual output to 1.4 million tonnes by 2000, Peng told reporters at the brewery.
LIFE CAN BE HARDER IN A MARKET ECONOMY
Under communist China's old command economy, Tsingtao was a luxury commodity in chronically short supply. But Peng said the market economy and the arrival of foreign brands were taking their toll.
""Before the foreigners came to China, almost all the high-class restaurants and hotels had our Tsingtao Beer,"" Peng said. ""In the market where we were once 100 percent, we now account for perhaps 70-80 percent.""
Against the glamour of foreign beers, Tsingtao touts its unique heritage as the premier domestic beer in one of the world's fastest-growing markets.
The company was founded in 1903 and initially targeted thirsty Germans living in the port city that Germany had wrested from a weak China.
Company officials say the beer also thrived during the Japanese occupation before and during World War Two.
The decades of state control that followed the communist revolution of 1949 were a factor behind Tsingtao's later neglect of its home market, said Elizabeth Cheng, head of China research at HSBC James Capel in Hong Kong.
""Now with the new management, hopefully they will be able to do something more dynamic,"" Cheng said.
A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY
Growing competition is not the only worry cited by analysts, who have long complained about a lack of transparency at the brewery, which is still 44 percent state-owned.
In 1994, the brewery drew investor ire when it was found to have lent out the foreign currency proceeds of its share flotations at high interest rates instead of investing them in its core business as promised.
Peng said that problem was mainly a misunderstanding.
""In some ways Chinese methods are not quite the same as international ones,"" Peng said, adding that lack of a clear investment plan had caused Tsingtao to put its money elsewhere.
The 4,000-strong workforce of the group, which has assets of 3.0 billion yuan ($360 million), is another potential concern.
""They are vastly overstaffed,"" said the Beijing-based analyst, a view seemingly borne out by the relaxed approach of many workers observed during a recent visit to the brewery.
Tsingtao says it still has up to 2.4 percent of the Chinese beer market, although the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) said last month that the share was now likely below 2.0 percent.
While life as a listed company would never be as easy as it was under the command economy, the analysts said Tsingtao was too much of a national symbol to be allowed to fail.
Tsingtao is also one of 10 domestic brewing groups that have been promised preferential loans and conditions from the government to help them compete with joint venture breweries.
""(Tsingtao is) troubled, but they will survive,"" said the Beijing-based analyst. ""They have very powerful backing... a lot of people do not want to see it go down the tubes.""

4298,"A sprawling new copper production group in China's southwestern Yunnan province is planning to boost minerals output in the nation's ""kingdom of non-ferrous metals"", senior company officials said on Friday.
Yunnan Copper Industry (Group) Co, which opened for business this month after the merger of Yunnan's biggest copper mines, bureaux and a major smelter, had mapped out a five-year plan to increase production, said general manager Zhou Paixiang.
Metals officials had ordered the group's creation to boost efficiency and make metals exploitation a bulwark of the economy in Yunnan, one of China's poorest provinces, group president Zou Shaolu told Reuters.
""Minerals resources are very rich here,"" Zou said in an interview. ""This is the 'kingdom of non-ferrous metals'.""
Output of electrolytic copper would be raised to 150,000 tonnes a year by 2000, increasing from 90,000 tonnes last year, said Zhou, the general manager.
The group's mines would wrest about 60,000 tonnes of copper ore a year from Yunnan's mountains, up from 45,000 tonnes, he said.
""Formation of the group will improve distribution of resources and personnel and bring the strengths of the companies into play,"" said Zou, the president. ""We have to find ways to raise productivity, together we are stronger.""
The shortfall between mine output and demand at its smelters would be made up by buying on the domestic and international markets, Zou said.
Copper imports for the smelters were expected to reach an annual 50,000 tonnes or more by 2000, he said. The Yunnan group already accounted for about one-ninth of China's copper output, he added.
Managers said copper would remain the core business of the sprawling group, which also mines minerals such as gold, silver and zinc and makes consumer goods ranging from traditional furniture to soft drinks.
The group's 3.14 billion yuan ($378 million) assets included hundreds of subsidiary companies, with only about one-half of its 34,000 employees involved in copper production.
The group would try to progressively spin off many of its ventures and would also move to reduce the heavy burden of its welfare commitments, Zhou said, adding that medical costs for its employees were a major expense.
The group's diversity helps protect against price fluctuations in the copper market, he said.
Copper prices slumped after the disclosure of huge trading losses by Japanese trading giant Sumitomo Corp, though they have since recovered some of the lost ground.
The Yunnan group planned to raise gold production to five tonnes a year in 2000 from three tonnes currently, boost silver output to 150 tonnes from 100 tonnes, zinc to 20,000 from about 10,000 tonnes and sulfuric acid to 300,000 tonnes from about 200,000 tonnes, managers said.
Shortages of capital were a major difficulty and the group was in talks with foreign companies to create possible joint venture projects, Zhou said.
""We have made some connections with foreign firms but so far we have no fixed plans,"" he said without giving further details.

4320,"A monster shakeup of Canada's biggest city, Toronto, has sparked a citizens' revolt against Ontario's ruling Conservatives and raised eyebrows among those who do business in the country's financial capital.
This clean, peaceful city -- sometimes dubbed ""New York run by the Swiss"" -- has recently become a battleground in the so-called ""Common Sense Revolution"" initiated by Ontario's Conservative Premier Mike Harris.
Promising leaner, cheaper government, Harris wants to merge Toronto and six neighbouring municipalities into a single ""megacity"" of 2.4 million people. The new city would hold about 8 percent of Canada's 30 million people and dwarf all but three of Canada's 10 provinces.
Harris also plans a fundamental shift in how public services -- everything from education to welfare -- are delivered and paid for.
Opponents fear the municipal reform blitz will drive up taxes and lead to the kind of urban decay witnessed in many cities in the United States, just across the border.
The threat of such wrenching change being rammed through without a binding plebiscite has outraged citizens and prompted accusations of tyranny and fascism.
""Government is not elected for the politicians. It is elected by the people for the people,"" Toronto Mayor Barbara Hall told a crowd after residents in the seven affected areas voted three to one against a merger in a referendum earlier this month. The vote was not binding on Ontario's government, which has vowed to press ahead with its plan.
The referendum capped a campaign that saw an Ontario cabinet minister likened to Adolf Hitler, bomb threats against a polling firm, and thousands of protesters marching in the streets in a re-enactment of a civic rebellion in 1837.
Harris has held firm. ""I don't think we can withdraw the need for change,"" he said, adding that there may be amendments when the legislation is introduced.
The ""megacity"" revolt has grabbed headlines across the country and overseas, even prompting some foreign consulates to keep a wary eye on the political wrangling.
""There is some interest, but it's purely because it has appeared in the (British) papers,"" said Terry Curran, the British Consul in Toronto.
Meanwhile, high-profile Canadian business leaders, politicians and artists have joined to oppose the merger plan.
They include film director Norman Jewison, Molson Cos. Ltd Chief Executive Norman Seagram, and writer Margaret Atwood who compared the megacity's architects to the Three Stooges.
The ""No"" side captured 75 percent of the votes in the referendum, but the process was flawed and turnout was low.
Under draft legislation, known as Bill 103, the seven city halls and 106 politicians who now govern the Greater Toronto Area will shrink to one elected mayor and 44 councillors.
The government also plans to overhaul property taxes, eliminate more than half of the province's school boards, seize control of education funding and download a bigger share of social programme costs onto the municipalities.
Harris has said the reforms are revenue neutral, but critics say municipalities may be forced to raise taxes.
They fear welfare rolls could soar and one of the hardest hit communities would be Toronto, which has a heavier welfare caseload and nearly half of the province's social housing.
""You're doing something that is very volatile and on a tax base which has very little flexibility,"" said George Fierheller, president of Toronto's Board of Trade.
More than 75 percent of the board's members favour reducing the size of government through a merger but nearly half worry about dumping such heavy responsibilities onto municipalities.
""As a Torontonian and a businessman responsible for a large company, I'm wary of abrupt change without making sure you've thought it through,"" said Peter Godsoe, chairman of Canada's fourth-largest bank, Bank of Nova Scotia.
The influential debt rating agency, Moody's Investors Service, has warned ""the very nature and scale of the reforms...create new challenges that could affect the credit quality of some municipalities.""
The downloading trend has been a feature of government at all levels in Canada as they struggle with budget deficits.
Ontario is in a tougher bind than most. Faced with a huge C$10 ($7.38) billion deficit when they came to power in 1995, the Conservatives slashed spending and cut the deficit to C$7.7 billion in 1996/97, while easing some taxes.
The Harris revolution has kept the government high in opinion polls, but public support has slipped recently, with backing for the Conservatives down to 37 percent in Metro Toronto, compared with 41 percent for the opposition Liberals.

4325,"The fallout from the Busang gold controversy has tarnished Canada's junior mining sector and wiil scare off many investors in 1997, investment advisors said on Thursday.
But they predicted a healthier industry will emerge in early 1998 after the Bre-X Minerals Ltd meltdown has faded into history.
""The Busang bust, no matter what the outcome of the Strathcona report, has killed this particular junior resource market cycle,"" John Kaiser, editor of a financial newsletter, told a Toronto mining investment conference on Thursday.
If they have not already done so, fund managers will reduce their holdings of junior mining stocks in the wake of the Bre-X saga, said the editor of Kaiser's Bottom-Fishing Report.
""The juniors will face a funding drought that will likely last through the rest of the year. Retail investors will stick to the sidelines because they know this market cycle is over,"" he said.
But Kaiser predicted the bull market will return in 1998.
""By early 1998, the Canadian resource juniors will be ready to emerge from the bear market trough into which it is now sliding,"" he said.
Toronto-based Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd is conducting an independent audit of Bre-X's Busang project which was thrown into doubt last month.
Bre-X has heralded Busang as the gold find of the century, but preliminary tests by its partner Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc indicated the deposit may contain ""insignificant"" amounts of gold.
The announcement prompted panic selling of Bre-X shares last month, lopping almost C$3 billion, or more than 80 percent, from the company's stock market value.
Bre-X firmed C13 cents to close at C$2.30 on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Thursday.
The Strathcona report is expected in early May.
Other investment gurus at the conference said Busang has not dealt a fatal blow to Canada's junior mining sector.
""I don't give it (the depressed market) much more that 90 days or 120 days. We'll be back in business after that,"" predicted Brian Fagan, editor of the Asian World Stock Report, a newsletter focused on the mineral exploration sector.
Last month's Busang-driven selloff in Canadian junior mining stocks has served up some bargains for investors. But they won't pay a high premium anymore.
""The companies are still good, but people are not willing to pay more for them,"" Fagan said.
James Dines, the California-based editor of The Dines Letter, admonished Canadian investors for turning sour on the gold sector as a whole.
The stampede to sell all gold stocks was just lemming like. There is nothing wrong with your gold industry. It will survive Bre-X,"" told the conference.
Kaiser predicted a more sophisticated investor will emerge when the junior mining cycle turns upward again. The Busang saga will also force analysts to take a more critical eye at junior mining companies and their projects.
""Dowm the road we will credit the Busang bust with launching a revolution in the way Canadian juniors get covered,"" Kaiser said.

4327,"Shares in Canadian gold prospector Bre-X Minerals Ltd. resumed trading on Wednesday, but massive trading volumes again overwhelmed a creaky computer system on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Bre-X's stock fell C65 cents to C$3.20 on the TSE on Wednesday before it was stopped in late morning due to heavy order volumes and ""technical difficulties,"" the exchange said.
Despite an abbreviated trading session, Bre-X dominated the market with turnover of 11.7 million shares.
The stock was halted all day on Monday and resumed trading in Toronto for 22 minutes on Tuesday before it collapsed the 20-year-old computer trading system and was halted.
""This is brutal. They are not going to come away untarnished as an exchange,"" one trader said.
Shares in the Calgary, Alberta-based firm have traded for just two hours on Canada's biggest equity market since investors lopped almost C$3 billion ($2.19 billion) off Bre-X's market value last Thursday.
Bre-X has been under heavy fire since last week when its partner in Indonesia, Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc., revealed that early drilling samples performed during its due diligence process on the Busang gold property in the rain forests of Borneo turned up ""insignificant"" amounts of gold and ""visual differences"" from Bre-X's gold samples.
While the TSE experienced more computer headaches, Bre-X stock continued trading on Nasdaq and the Montreal and Alberta exchanges on Wednesday.
Bre-X closed down 19 cents at $2.315 on 9.4 million shares on Nasdaq. In Montreal, the stock fell C35 cents to C$3.15 on 6.2 million shares.
Analysts predicted more volatility. ""All I see happening in the market right now is the battle lines have been drawn between the believers and non-believers and the salting and non-salting crowd. At the end of the day we'll have to see if its zero or the moonshot,"" Merrill Lynch analyst David Christensen said.
Bre-X Chief Executive David Walsh has insisted tampering with core samples was impossible and an independent audit would prove the company's findings.
Bre-X has claimed Busang has an estimated 70.95 million ounces of gold worth $20 billion.
Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd., an independent mining consultant hired by Bre-X, was expected to begin analyzing its samples from independent drilling at Busang by mid-April, industry sources in Jakarta told Reuters.
""The (drilling) program should be finished by mid-April and the cores flown together to Perth (Australia) around 12 or 15 of April. Everyone is hoping for the results by the end of the month,"" one source said.
Meanwhile, Freeport said on Wednesday it would not comment on reports that its next round of Busang drilling results could be delivered to Bre-X soon.
""We just don't know what the timetable is,"" Freeport spokeswoman Kristen Lemkau said in a telephone interview.

4331,"U.S. mining giant Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc. has extended its review of a controversial Indonesian gold mining project until June 30, Canadian gold prospector Bre-X Minerals Ltd. said Wednesday.
New Orleans-based Freeport, a partner in the Busang project in Indonesia, requested the extension ""to allow for consideration of the findings of the Strathcona audit,"" Bre-X said in a statement.
Toronto-based Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd. is expected to deliver a key report on Busang to Bre-X on Thursday or Friday. Bre-X has said it will issue a press release on the report before North American financial markets open on Monday.
Rumours have swirled around Busang since what has been called the century's biggest gold find was cast into doubt on March 26 when Freeport-McMoRan said its preliminary tests found ""insignificant"" amounts of gold.
Bre-X has estimated Busang contains about 71 million ounces of gold, potentially the largest in the world.
Panic selling of Bre-X shares lopped almost C$3 billion ($2.1 billion) from the company's stock market value last month, wiping out 80 percent of its market worth.
Freeport spokeswoman Kristin Lemkau said on Wednesday the request for the extension was made within the past week.
""The original agreement with Bre-X signed on February 26 said that FCX's due diligence expired on April 30. This is really just to announce that we had pushed that date to June 30 to allow time for completion of the independent audit by Strathcona,"" Lemkau said in a telephone interview.
Lemkau declined to comment when asked if Freeport planned any further drilling at Busang over the next two months.
Bre-X shares led fell 32 cents Canadian (23 cents) to C$3.48 ($2.52) in heavy trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Some investors on an Internet chat page speculated that Freeport's extension was favourable to Bre-X, but mining analysts cautioned against reading too much into the announcement.
""I don't think we should read into the request, although obviously investors are,"" said John Ing, president of Maison Placements Canada Inc.
""Everybody is reading a lot into the rumours. But really they are just rumours right now,"" another Canadian mining analyst said.
An Indonesian newspaper, citing unnamed sources, reported earlier this week that leaked results of Strathcona's drill tests showed ""cheerful"" grades of gold.
But in a report in the Calgary Sun newspaper on Wednesday, Strathcona President Graham Farquharson said it was unlikely that his company's findings had been leaked.
""I still haven't seen the results myself -- the assays are still under way. So I have to doubt the claim,"" Farquharson was quoted as saying by the Sun. ""To the best of my knowledge there've been no leaks,"" he said.
Strathcona said last week it would maintain tight security over the assaying of its core samples at laboratories in Canada, Indonesia and Australia.
Only one or two persons in management at each laboratory would have access to the final assays and the results would not be reported until all the lab work was finished.
Strathcona has said its final report to Bre-X would be delivered about six weeks after an interim report.

4334,"Shares in Bre-X Minerals Ltd. soared on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Wednesday as rumors continued to swirl around the Busang gold deposit and analysts sifted through drill results from the site.
The Calgary, Alberta-based company's stock jumped C$1.22 to close at C$3.62 on massive turnover of 17 million shares on Canada's biggest stock market.
Frenzied late afternoon trading pushed the volatile stock to a session high of C$5.75.
Bre-X has been embroiled in controversy since preliminary tests by its partner, Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc., on the gold property indicated the deposit may contain ""insignificant"" amounts of gold.
The announcement prompted panic selling of Bre-X shares last month, lopping almost C$3 billion ($2.2 billion), or more than 80 percent, from the company's stock market value.
Reports on Wednesday that Freeport recently received the first independent tests of the Busang deposit by a Canadian firm were challenged by Freeport and Bre-X officials.
The reports said Freeport received the tests while Freeport Chief Executive Jim Bob Moffett was in Indonesia and held meetings with President Suharto.
""The testing is still going on and Freeport has not been informed of any assay results,"" Freeport spokeswoman Kristen Lemkau told Reuters by telephone.
Bre-X commissioned Toronto-based Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd. last month to conduct an audit of its Busang project. The results are expected in early May.
""The audit was commissioned by Bre-X and it is going to be submitted to Bre-X,"" said Bre-X spokesman Richard Wool, adding that it was Bre-X that would release the audit results.
Bre-X late on Tuesday released drill results from 22 holes at the Busang property that were not included in its resource calculation of 70.95 million ounces of gold released on February 17.
Bre-X said 16 holes produced values ranging from 1.05 grams per tonne to 7.58 grams per tonne, while six holes showed no significant amount of gold.
""They were sort of old holes, but I think investors are taking it positively,"" said one mining analyst.
John Kaiser, editor of the Kaiser Bottom-Fishing Report, said the drill results released on Tuesday were positive, but not enough to quash the controversy surrounding Busang.
He said the final word on Busang was still up to two weeks away.
""We need to know what the numbers for this deposit run as produced by strictly controlled sampling, drilling and assaying procedures. Until we get a batch of results where we know that there is nothing screwy along the way, everything is uncertain,"" Kaiser said.
The Busang saga took another curious twist on Wednesday when an Indonesian company linked to President Suharto raised its stake in the Busang property.
Nusamba Group, 80 percent-owned by three foundations headed by President Suharto, raised its stake in the main Busang II section to 25 percent. Pt Askatindo Karya Minerals reduced its stake to five percent from 15 percent, said a spokesman for the family-owned company.
Bre-X has a 45 percent stake in Busang, Freeport has 15 percent and the Indonesian government 10 percent.

4339,"Molson Cos Ltd will hold its annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, under pressure for a stock buyback as the cash-rich Canadian beer giant searches worldwide for a brewing acquisition.
It also marks the debut of a new chief executive to lead the company's return to its 210-year-old brewing roots after a failed foray into specialty chemicals.
With the C$1 billion sale of its Diversey Corp chemicals unit almost completed, Molson is looking for overseas opportunities to expand its core brewing business.  
But some investors, worried that a deal would be too pricey, are pushing the brewer for a share buyback.
""We're getting answers from across the spectrum,"" Brian Crombie, senior vice president of corporate finance, said of Molson's recent talks with investors.
""You've got some institutions saying they would prefer that the company buy back shares. You've got other institutions saying that they are willing to give Molson time to consider its options,"" Crombie said in an interview.
Molson owns 40 percent of Canada's largest brewer, Molson Breweries, which makes Molson Canadian, Golden and Red Dog.  
The rest of Molson Breweries is owned 40 percent by Australia's Foster's Brewing Group Ltd and 20 percent by Philip Morris Cos Inc's Miller Brewing unit.
Molson has expressed interest in buying a bigger stake in Molson Breweries, but neither Foster's nor Miller appears ready to part with its stake, Crombie said.
Looking offshore, analysts said good brewing assets would likely command a high price. ""There's a lot of work going on, but I don't think they can make an acquisition at a reasonable price,"" said Mike Palmer, an analyst with Toronto-based Equity Research Associates.  
Jitters about what Molson will do with the Diversey proceeds has weighed on the brewer's share price. Molson class A stock hit a 52-week high of C$25.125 after it announced plans to sell Diversey last winter. The stock has since drifted down to about C$20.
Norman Seagram, Molson's new president and chief executive, is expected to outline his vision for the company when he addresses shareholders at the meeting in Montreal.

4341,"The fallout from news that Bre-X Minerals Ltd.'s Busang gold discovery may be nowhere near as rich as it projected rocked the mining world and Canadian markets on Thursday, with securities regulators scrambling to investigate.
Gold shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange, Canada's biggest equities market, tumbled more than 300 points or almost 3.0 percent in frenzied trading on Thursday, dragging down the entire market.
Canadian regulators were working closely with Toronto exchange officials to unravel the biggest mining controversy in decades.
""We're working with the TSE on this matter. I don't know what will come of that. There really isn't more I can tell you,"" said a spokesman for the Ontario Securities Commission, the province's securities regulator.
While other small mining stocks were hammered, Bre-X remained halted in Toronto and on Nasdaq as huge questions loomed over its claim to have made the biggest gold discovery this century.
Bre-X, which soared to C$250 from mere pennies before a 10-for-1 stock split, last traded at C$15.50 before it was halted on Wednesday. The company was expected to issue a further news release on Thursday, the Toronto exchange said.
Several Canadian mutual fund managers planned to write down their Bre-X holdings, while market players speculated the stock could re-open below C$2.
""We have Canadian funds marking it at C$1, C$2. Two dollars is C$500 million ($365 million) in market cap -- that's still a lot of money,"" a New York arbritager said.
Calgary, Alberta-based Bre-X admitted on Wednesday that test samples from the Busang gold property on the island of Borneo may have been overstated.
The news came just one week after the mysterious death of Bre-X's chief Busang geologist, who plunged out of a helicopter into the jungle in an apparent suicide.
Bre-X Chief Executive David Walsh, who made millions from the discovery, is believed to have returned to the Bahamas where he now lives.
Walsh earlier this week complained about rumors that the find may be overstated and even threatened legal action ""against certain parties and publications.""
But he admitted on Wednesday that ""there appears to be a strong possibility that the potential gold resources on the Busang project in East Kalimantan, Indonesia have been overstated because of invalid samples and assaying of those samples.""
New Orleans-based Freeport McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc., Bre-X's partner in Busang, set off the alarm bells on Wednesday, saying that its own studies so far ""indicate insignificant amounts of gold.""
Shares in Freeport were up 50 cents to $30.125 on Thursday after sinking sharply on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.
Toronto, Canada's financial capital, has been a major source of capital for small mining companies venturing abroad. Analysts predicted the Bre-X story would hurt Toronto's image and make it much harder to raise cash.
""No matter who ends up wearing the blame for Bre-X's woes...and there looks to be plenty of blame to go around...the integrity of all junior mining stocks has taken a serious hit,"" Toronto Globe and Mail columnist Andrew Willis wrote.
Bre-X earlier this year issued confirmed estimates that the Busang deposit held at least 71 million ounces of gold, worth about $20 billion at current gold prices.
At that level, Busang would be the most significant gold find since the discovery of the Witwatersrand goldfields in South Africa in the late 1800s.
Bre-X's head of exploration John Felderhof, who was recently honored at a mining conference in Toronto, asserted last month that Busang may contain up to 200 million ounces of gold.
Bre-X shares sank last week after an Indonesian newspaper report quoted unnamed sources as saying Freeport, which holds 15 per cent of Busang, had doubts about the size and viability of the deposit.
The rumors were fanned to fever pitch by the death, billed as a suicide, of Bre-X chief geologist Michael de Guzman, who fell from a helicopter en route to Busang last week.
Bre-X and its maverick chairman Walsh have been the envy of the international mining community since Walsh gambled the company's last C$10,000 ($7,280) in 1993 and struck gold in Indonesia's East Kalimantan province.
""There's nothing like success. Our other explorations have been zero. I had never imagined it would be this big,"" Walsh told Reuters in an interview last month.

4345,"The presumed death of geologist Michael de Guzman, who helped discover Indonesia's rich Busang gold site, on Wednesday shocked fellow prospectors and highlighted the dangers of their profession.
De Guzman, chief geologist for Calgary-based Bre-X Minerals Ltd, fell out of a helicopter as he was returning to the Busang mine site in Indonesia's East Kalamantan province.
Rescue crews were still searching the dense Borneo jungle for 41-year-old Filipino's body after he fell about 800 feet from the helicopter.
""It's very tragic and he will be remembered as a fine geologist,"" Bre-X Minerals chief executive David Walsh said in a telephone interview.
De Guzman was a key member of the team which discovered Busang -- the richest gold find this century -- a few years ago. Bre-X has since agreed to develop the Busang site, valued at US$25 billion, with U.S.-based Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc and Indonesian partners.
""He (de Guzman) was a very respected geologist and well respected within the mining community,"" said Mario Steiner, president of Aerodat Inc, a geological survey company.
Bre-X's stock was halted for several hours on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Wednesday before Bre-X issued a statement.
The company's stock closed down 0.40 at 17.25 on volume of 5.2 million shares.
Bre-X senior vice-president of exploration John Felderhof, who is currently in North America, will return to Indonesia, Walsh said.
This is the latest tragedy involving Canadian mining and exploration companies in far-flung corners of the world.
In October 1995, nine employees of Saskatoon-based Cameco Corp were killed in a helicopter crash in Kyrgyzstan.
The Kyrgyzstan Air helicopter, chartered by a Cameco unit, was en route from the Kumtor gold mine when it went down.
The families of the nine Canadians killed in the crash have said they plan to file a C$20.7 million lawsuit alleging Cameco and other defendants were negligent.
Airborne surveyor Aerodat Inc has lost three aircraft since 1994, the latest in the dense eastern Amazon jungle of Peru.
In September 1996, Falconbridge Ltd chief executive Franklin Pickard died of a heart attack while visiting the company's copper site high in Chile's Andes Mountains.
""It puts you in circumstances that maybe other jobs wouldn't put you in, but the industry has very high safety standards,"" said Tony Andrews, executive director of the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada.

4355,"Tate &amp; Lyle Plc said Tuesday its U.S. subsidiary A.E. Staley continues to face reduced profit margins for high fructose corn syrup, a sweetener.
Fructose contract prices for 1997, which largely have been set, are lower than a year ago, as are corn costs, said Larry Pillard, chief executive of London-based Tate &amp; Lyle.
""On a margin basis (factoring out corn cost changes) they are maybe slightly lower,"" Pillard told Reuters at an analysts' conference here.  
Pillard blamed lower margins on overcapacity in the U.S. fructose industry. Staley's output accounts for a little over 20 percent of total U.S. fructose production.
To balance the softness in fructose margins, Staley has shifted some output to other corn-based products, including ethanol, starch used by the paper industry, and specialty food starches.  
""In addition to that, we've continued our very aggressive cost-reduction initiatives at Staley,"" Pillard said. ""Yes, we'd like higher margins in fructose. But we're not completely dissatisfied with Staley. We're still very bullish on the corn refining business.""
He added that U.S. fructose demand continues to grow by four to five percent a year.
Pillard acknowledged that ""in a worst case scenario"" it may be another two or three years before demand in the U.S. catches up with fructose supplies.  
But one promising variable is the potential for greater demand for fructose in Mexico.
Beyond fructose, Tate &amp; Lyle is investing in number of value-added products, including a lactic acid plant it likely will build in the United States and a citric acid joint venture in India.
Tate &amp; Lyle, as a producer of sweeteners and starches, is already expanding its global presence, with investments in developing markets.
Those investments, which have totaled $250 million over the past few years and spread over four continents -- is projected to generate a return on invesment of over 20 percent after five years, according to Simon Gifford, group finance director for Tate &amp; Lyle.
Investments have been made in Mexico, central and eastern Europe, Asia and Africa.
Tate &amp; Lyle also is building a world-scale starch plant in northern France, which will use wheat as a raw material.
""That will be completed by the end of this calendar year,"" Gifford said. ""We will start getting returns after commissioning in the second half of next year.""

4363,"Kellogg Co, whose profits for 1996 are under pressure from price cuts and promotions, threw down the gauntlet that it will take the necessary steps to preserve its category leadership, which may mean further discounts, analysts said.
""They (Kellogg) might cut prices again or increase promotions again,"" said Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette analyst William Leach.
On Wednesday, Chairman Arnold Langbo said Kellogg will direct its efforts away from deep price promotion.  
""..However, we are unwilling to see our leadership position compromised,"" Langbo added in a statement.
Earlier this year, Kellogg, General Mills Inc and the Post Cereal division of Philip Morris Cos Inc cut retail prices in an effort to spark a sluggish category.
""On balance consumers want lower prices still,"" Smith Barney analyst David Rabinowitz said. ""They'll either get that in the form of lower list prices or extraordinarily high levels of promotion.""  
While many analysts had expected Kellogg to report earnings below last year's $3.48 a share, the magnitude of the potential decline did come as a surprise for some.
""Their guidance has been much different,"" added Leach, who had been projecting full-year earnings of $3.15 a share.
In July, analysts said Kellogg was still guiding them that earnings for 1996 would match 1995 levels.
According to First Call, the consensus for 1996 earnings has been $3.35 a share, with a range of $3.15 to $3.50.  
Kellogg said it now believes earnings for the third quarter will be about 20 percent below the $1.05 per share earned in the 1995 period. It added that while earnings per share will grow in the fourth quarter, results for the full year will be less than $3.48 a share.
Kellogg said its results for the third quarter were hurt by competitive promotions in the U.S. cereal category.
In a report issued in late August, BT Securities analyst John O'Neil said there had been a disparity in promotional spending among major cereal manufacturers. Post, he said, continued some discounting and General Mills maintained an Olympics-themed promotion while Kellogg reduced promotion efforts after cutting prices.

4374,"Former Archer Daniels Midland Co. executive Mark Whitacre, who acted as an informant in an antitrust investigation, filed suit on Monday against the Federal Bureau of Investigation agent who allegedly recruited him.
In his suit, filed in the U.S. District Court of the Central District of Illinois, Whitacre charged FBI Agent Brian Shepard with allegedly violating his constitutional rights, inflicting emotional distress, and assault and battery.
Because the suit targets Shepard in his official capacity as an agent, Whitacre is effectively suing the FBI, according to a legal expert.
""It would be tantamount to suing the whole FBI,"" said Chicago attorney James Shapiro, who is a former assistant U.S. Attorney.
The FBI press office in Washington, as a matter of policy, declined to comment on Whitacre's lawsuit. ""We couldn't discuss or comment on pending litigation,"" an FBI spokesman said.
A Justice Department spokesman was not immediately available, and an FBI spokesman in Springfield, Ill., also was not available for comment.
The lawsuit is the latest twist in the legal tangle involving Whitacre, who said he acted as a government informant from 1992 through 1995 to assist in the Justice Department's antitrust probe of Decatur, Ill.-based Archer Daniels Midland, one of the world's largest processors of corn and other crops.
Whitacre had been president of ADM's BioProducts Division until he was fired in August 1995. ADM has charged that Whitacre allegedly stole about $9 million from it.
Whitacre has denied those charges, saying he received the money in off-the-books payments that allegedly were authorised by ADM officials.
In October 1996, as part of the antitrust probe, ADM pleaded guilty to two counts of fixing prices of lysine, a feed additive, and citric acid, which is used in food, beverages and other products. ADM agreed to pay $100 million in fines, a record for antitrust actions.
In December 1996, Whitacre was indicted for allegedly conspiring to fix prices of lysine. Also indicted at that time were Michael Andreas, former vice chairman of ADM and son of Chairman Dwayne Andreas, and Terrance Wilson, a former group vice president.
Whitacre, Michael Andreas and Wilson have pleaded not guilty to those charges.
In his lawsuit, filed in Urbana, Ill., Whitacre said he had repeatedly discussed with Shepard a grant of immunity in exchange for cooperating with the antitrust investigation.
Whitacre said he wanted to seek out an attorney regarding his role as a informer. He alleged that Shepard kept him from obtaining an attorney, in violation of his constitutional rights under the 1st and 5th Amendments.
Whitacre also claimed in his lawsuit that there were episodes when Shepard allegedly became ""angry, shouted, directed abusive language"" toward him and threatened him with criminal prosecution if he sought the counsel of an attorney.
In the lawsuit, Whitacre also claimed that in late February or early March 1993, Shepard allegedly struck him with a hard-sided briefcase.
He further charged that Shepard kept him from seeking medical treatment for depression and suicidal tendencies, which exacerbated his manic depression.
Whitacre said he attempted suicide on Aug. 9, 1995.
Separately, in U.S. District Court in Chicago, Cheil Jedang Ltd. of Seoul, South Korea, entered a guilty plea to charges of fixing lysine prices. The company agreed to pay a $1.25 million fine, which was suspended until the end of the ADM litigation.

4375,"Breakfast cereal price wars may make consumers smile, but they're putting frowns on faces at some of the nation's largest cereal makers.
Industry analysts said Kellogg Co., the No. 1 cereal maker, is expected to report flat earnings for the latest quarter, while Ralcorp Holdings Inc., a big maker of store brand cereal, was likely to report lower earnings.
Price cuts and promotions in the $9 billion cereal business have hurt results at both companies, analysts said.
Kellogg, based in Battle Creek, Mich., has lost sales to competitors such as General Mills Inc., its biggest rival, which cut prices early last year. General Mills' earnings rose 7.5 percent in its latest quarter, on an increase in market share sparked partly by promotions.
The price cutting, started by Post Cereal, forced Kellogg, General Mills and others to follow suit. Post, a unit of Philip Morris Cos. Inc., does not report results separately.
Kellogg said in November that it would take steps to counter the price cuts and other promotions that eroded its market share to about 33 percent from 35 percent, analysts said.
While its counterattacks appear to be paying off -- analysts said Kellogg's market share seems to have risen a bit in December -- they are also pressuring earnings.
""(Kellogg's) domestic earnings are clearly going to be down on lower sales and some increase in marketing spending,"" said Goldman Sachs analyst Nomi Ghez.
In October Kellogg said earnings fell 31 percent in the third quarter, hurt by promotions by rivals. It pledged at the time that earnings growth would resume in the fourth quarter, analysts said, but most are forecasting flat or slightly lower results. For the 1995 fourth quarter, Kellogg earned $166.7 million, or 77 cents a share.
Kellogg also moved to diversify its breakfast food business last month when it bought Lender's Bagels from Kraft Foods Inc. for $455 million.
Quaker Oats Co., a maker of cereals and other food products, is expected to report an operating profit for the fourth quarter, compared with a loss a year ago. But Quaker is also expected to take a charge in the quarter to write down the value of its Snapple beverage business.
""The issue for Quaker is how big of a charge they take for Snapple,"" said BT Securities analyst John O'Neil.
Quaker said in a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it was reviewing a possible writeoff related to Snapple. A Quaker spokesman declined to comment on the possibility of a charge in the fourth quarter.
Among other food companies, Sara Lee Corp. is expected to report a strong increase in earnings, with the biggest improvement in its meat and bakery division, said Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette analyst William Leach.
Analysts said CPC International Inc., which makes Hellman's mayonnaise, Mazola corn oil, Skippy peanut butter and Thomas' English muffins, would report a smaller than normal rise in quarterly earnings, due to high corn costs. Corn refining accounts for 15 percent of CPC's sales, which were $8.4 billion in 1995.

""We expect to finish the year with record earnings, record volume and record market share,"" General Mills Chairman Stephen Sanger said in an interview here after a presentation at an analysts' conference.  
In fiscal 1996, Minneapolis-based General Mills earned $3.00 a share with sales of $5.42 billion.
The company also reaped seven percent domestic volume growth and 13 percent international volume growth in fiscal 1997.
For the first nine months of the year, General Mills, which makes cereals, Betty Crocker baking mixes, Hamburger Helper skillet dinner mixes, fruit snacks and yogurt, is expected to reach its volume target of four percent growth, Sanger added.  
As previously reported, General Mills expects a recent decline in cereal prices will reduce earnings for fiscal 1997, which ends in May, by about $0.20 a share. Its recently completed acquisition of the branded cereal and snacks business of Ralcorp Holdings Inc, as previously disclosed, is expected to reduce earnings by about $0.05 a share.
In the first half of fiscal 1997, General Mills posted a profit of $1.80 a share, up one percent, and sales of $2.88 billion, up six percent.
Earnings in the first half were relatively flat, Sanger said, partly because of the cereal price reduction, while sales benefited from some strong promotion.
""The second half will be a bit of the flip of that with modest volume growth, but stronger earnings,"" Sanger said.
Looking ahead, Sanger said General Mills' goal continues to be to grow earnings per share ""over the long term,"" and to post a return on capital of at least 25 percent.

""With the right mix of acquisitions, I think we could do $75 million to $100 million (in sales) annually. We've (also) got some things that could really take off internally,"" Stephen Rubin, president, said in an interview. ""I'd like to see it (the sales target reached) before five years.""
Vita's sales amounted to $21.4 million in 1995.  
The company, with products such as salmon and herring sold under the Vita brand, expects to complete at least one acquisition by the end of the year, Rubin said.
Acquisition targets include companies that sell kosher food or products that could later be certified as kosher. One of the targets is related to seafood, he added.
Rubin added that Vita could also acquire a regional, non-kosher food company and take it national under the existing brand name through Vita's distribution network.
Over 95 percent of Vita's sales, however, are kosher products.  
Jay Dembsky, Vita's chief financial officer, estimated that the kosher food market overall is growing by 10 to 11 percent annually, whereas the overall food industry grows only in line with the population.
Kosher food, he added, appeals to consumers beyond those adhering to Jewish dietary laws. Kosher food carries ""a perception of higher quality,"" Dembsky said.
Vita also hopes to reap higher sales in 1997 from two new products that were rolled out in the fourth quarter of 1996 -- a line of hummus, a Middle Eastern dish made from chick peas, and frozen salmon burgers.
""We expect to see meaningful impact in 1997 from these products,"" Dembsky said.
Vita, which went public earlier this year at $6.00 a share, said it would make secondary offerings in the future if it needed to raise capital for acquisition programs, Rubin said.
Vita shres were up 1/8 at 5-1/8.

4389,"Former Archer Daniels Midland Co. executive Mark Whitacre, who acted as an informant in an antitrust investigation, filed suit on Monday against the Federal Bureau of Investigation agent who allegedly recruited him.
In his suit, filed in the U.S. District Court of the Central District of Illinois, Whitacre charged FBI Agent Brian Shepard with allegedly violating his constitutional rights, inflicting emotional distress, and assault and battery.
Because the suit targets Shepard in his official capacity as an agent, Whitacre is effectively suing the FBI, according to a legal expert.
""It would be tantamount to suing the whole FBI,"" said Chicago attorney James Shapiro, who is a former assistant U.S. Attorney.
The FBI press office in Washington, as a matter of policy, declined to comment on Whitacre's lawsuit. ""We couldn't discuss or comment on pending litigation,"" an FBI spokesman said.
A Justice Department spokesman was not immediately available, and an FBI spokesman in Springfield, Ill., also was not available for comment.
The lawsuit is the latest twist in the legal tangle involving Whitacre, who said he acted as a government informant from 1992 through 1995 to assist in the Justice Department's antitrust probe of Decatur, Ill.-based Archer Daniels Midland, one of the world's largest processors of corn and other crops.
Whitacre had been president of ADM's BioProducts Division until he was fired in August 1995. ADM has charged that Whitacre allegedly stole about $9 million from it.
Whitacre has denied those charges, saying he received the money in off-the-books payments that allegedly were authorized by ADM officials.
In October 1996, as part of the antitrust probe, ADM pleaded guilty to two counts of fixing prices of lysine, a feed additive, and citric acid, which is used in food, beverages and other products. ADM agreed to pay $100 million in fines, a record for antitrust actions.
In December 1996, Whitacre was indicted for allegedly conspiring to fix prices of lysine. Also indicted at that time were Michael Andreas, former vice chairman of ADM and son of Chairman Dwayne Andreas, and Terrance Wilson, a former group vice president.
Whitacre, Michael Andreas and Wilson have pleaded not guilty to those charges.
In his lawsuit, filed in Urbana, Ill., Whitacre said he had repeatedly discussed with Shepard a grant of immunity in exchange for cooperating with the antitrust investigation.
Whitacre said he wanted to seek out an attorney regarding his role as a informer. He alleged that Shepard kept him from obtaining an attorney, in violation of his constitutional rights under the 1st and 5th Amendments.
Whitacre also claimed in his lawsuit that there were episodes when Shepard allegedly became ""angry, shouted, directed abusive language"" toward him and threatened him with criminal prosecution if he sought the counsel of an attorney.
In the lawsuit, Whitacre also claimed that in late February or early March 1993, Shepard allegedly struck him with a hard-sided briefcase.
He further charged that Shepard kept him from seeking medical treatment for depression and suicidal tendencies, which exacerbated his manic depression.
Whitacre said he attempted suicide on Aug. 9, 1995.
Separately, in U.S. District Court in Chicago, Cheil Jedang Ltd. of Seoul, South Korea, entered a guilty plea to charges of fixing lysine prices. The company agreed to pay a $1.25 million fine, which was suspended until the end of the ADM litigation.

4394,"McDonald's Corp. Thursday reported a 12 percent rise in fourth-quarter profits, in spite of weaker U.S. results, and said it plans to cut back on its restaurant expansion.
The nation's biggest fast-food restaurant chain said its income rose to $410.0 million, including a $48.7 million after-tax charge, from $366.8 million a year ago.
The charge reflects the company's plans to close about 115 low-volume satellite units across the United States this year. As of Dec. 31, McDonald's had 2,218 satellite units, which typically have a limited menu and are located in non-traditional sites like shopping malls.
""These are really the sites that didn't pan out,"" said McDonald's Chief Financial Officer Mike Conley.
In 1997, McDonald's said it plans to open fewer satellite restaurants, while emphasizing full-scale units. As a result, McDonald's is trimming its overall restaurant opening plan for 1997 to between 2,400 and 2,800, compared with a previous target of 2,500 to 3,200.
""Going foward we think our emphasis is going to be traditional restaurants,"" Conley said in an interview.
McDonald's said more than 70 percent of the new restaurants will be outside the United States. In the past, about two-thirds of McDonald's new units have been outside the United States.
The fast-food giant, with more than 21,000 units worldwide, including 12,000 in the United States, said it is working to improve its U.S. results.
In the fourth quarter, McDonald's said its U.S. operating income fell 28 percent, including the charge, to $217.7 million. Excluding the charge, U.S. operating income fell 4 percent.
As analysts had expected, McDonald's said its domestic same store sales -- measuring results from units open at least a year -- were down in the fourth quarter and for all of 1996 compared with a year earlier.
Offsetting the decline domestically was a 14 percent gain in international operating income and an 11 percent rise in sales in the fourth quarter.
In the United States, however, McDonald's performance fell short of its goals, according to Jack Greenburg, company vice chairman and chairman-U.S.A. ""In 1997, our focus will be squarely on improving sales at existing restaurants through improvements in marketing, service and menu,"" he said in a statement.
Conley said McDonald's will continue to be aggressive on pricing in the face of competition, but declined to give any specifics.
""We want to provide the best value to our customers ... and a big part of it is price,"" he said. ""You'll see us being aggressive on price-value as we always have been.""
Schroder Wertheim analyst Wayne Daniels said he expects McDonald's to launch more national price promotions in 1997, as opposed to its current practice of giving franchisees the option to offer local promotions.
""(McDonald's) average ticket did climb during 1996,"" when it launched higher-priced premium sandwiches such as the Arch Deluxe, Daniels said. ""I do think that they will reverse that somewhat as they are a little more aggressive on national price promotions.""
Conley said McDonald's will continue to work on food taste, but said changes would be ""evolutionary and not revolutionary.""
""So don't expect a spate of new products,"" he said. ""That's really unlikely.""
McDonald's stock gained $1.125 to $46.375 on the New York Stock Exchange.

4399,"The stock of Kellogg Co. fell Thursday after it warned about lower earnings this year and sparked concerns that it could resort to increased promotions to protect its leading market share, analysts said.
Kellogg's stock fell $1.125 to $67.375 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
The leading producer in the $9 billion U.S. ready-to-eat cereal market said late Wednesday that its third-quarter earnings would be about 20 percent below the $1.05 a share it earned a year earlier, when it posted net income of $230 million.
Kellogg also said that, while it expected earnings will increase in the fourth quarter, its full-year profits for 1996 will be less than the $3.48 a year it earned in 1995. For all of 1995, Kellogg posted net income of $761.6 million before one-time charges.
The Battle Creek, Mich.-based company blamed competitive promotions by others in the cereal category for the decline in its third-quarter profits.
Earlier this year Kellogg and other leading cereal makers cut retail cereal prices. At the same time, Kellogg reduced promotional spending, such as offering special discounts in supermarkets.
Kellogg said it has cut back on promotional spending for more than two years.
""We will continue to direct our efforts away from deep price promotion; however, we are unwilling to see our leadership position comprised,"" Chairman Arnold Langbo said in a statement issued late Wednesday.
Analysts interpreted that as a warning that Kellogg might cut prices further or increase its own promotional spending if competitors continue their promotional practices in an effort to gain market share.
Kellogg accounts for nearly one-third of the U.S. cereal market, followed by General Mills Inc. with about one-quarter of U.S. sales. Third-place Post Cereals, including its Nabisco brands, accounts for about 17 percent of the U.S. market.
""It appears that Kellogg will be forced to deviate from its strategy of reducing promotions and will increase promotions to defend its market share,"" BT Securities analyst John O'Neil said.
On Thursday O'Neil reduced his estimate for Kellogg's 1996 earnings to $3.10 a share from $3.30 and his 1997 estimate to $3.60 a share from $3.70.
""If competitors do not scale back their promotional spending, (Kellogg) may reaccelerate its own spending or resort to another price cut,"" Goldman Sachs analyst Nomi Ghez wrote in a report.
Earlier this year Kellogg had predicted its earnings for 1996 would match the $3.48 a share it earned in 1995.
While many analysts at the time questioned Kellogg's ability to meet that target, the magnitude of the drop in the current earnings outlook took the market by surprise.

4402,"Hong Kong's top civil servant Anson Chan has signalled an open rift and rising tension in the new Beijing-approved administration to take over when Britain hands control back to China on July 1.
In two outbursts in as many weeks, the Chief Secretary has called for prompt elections, a credible legislature and respect for civil liberties - a clear warning to China.
Amid widespread doubt on the scope of freedom under Chinese rule, she said she was prepared to quit if asked to accept policies that clashed with her principles.
Chan, 57, is Hong Kong's top career administrator. She is deputy to departing colonial governor Chris Patten and has been asked to stay in the post as second-in-command to future leader Tung Chee-hwa.
Tung, a conservative and former shipping magnate, is waiting to take over at the head of a new administration that includes an assembly already chosen to replace the elected legislature.
Her tough words seemed to reflect speculation in Hong Kong of rifts opening up between Tung and his top officials, such as Chan and Financial Secretary Donald Tsang.
Her remarks were seen as a warning broadside just 28 days before the handover.""She is playing here her only trump card and I'm surprised she's had to play it this early,"" David Newman, political science professor at Lingnan College, told Reuters.
""I like to think I'm a loyal civil servant, but loyalty is not everything in my eyes,"" Chan told Newsweek International in the latest of a flurry of interviews by Hong Kong political leaders as the handover nears.
""There might be issues that are points of principle, and, as a matter of conscience, you feel you can't accept those decisions,"" she said. ""When that happens, you start asking yourself 'Do I stay or do I go?' And I think most people would know what my answer would be.""
""She is signalling she will have difficulty stomaching what the political appointees are going to try to do,"" Newman said.
""It is going to be very difficult for someone with high and sincere beliefs and a liberal mind to stand silently and watch what is going to go on around here,"" he said.
Touching on arguably the most important element of the handover to China, Chan expressed strong support for the gradual introduction of democracy.
But she called for public participation in the drawing up of the electoral system to ensure that Hong Kong does end up with a ""credible"" legislature.
Her comments appeared as Tung chided Britain for introducing democratic reforms without China's consent.
""The issue is that to go ahead without the consent of the future sovereign should not happen, it shouldn't have happened,"" Tung said in a British Broadcasting Corporation interview.
The reforms have become a major source of friction between Britain and China, prompting Beijing's vow to scrap Hong Kong's elected legislature on July 1. But departing governor Patten is far from remorseful.
""As it is, people in Hong Kong now have a few benchmarks,"" he said on Monday. ""They know what a free election is like.""
Chan's outspoken views drew praise from some commentators, but an editorial in the Hong Kong Standard newspaper said Chan had set ""a dangerous precedent"". ""Open challenges of this nature must not be allowed to happen,"" it said.
Bob Broadfoot, head of a think-tank, the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy, said the type of restrictions on the right to comment imposed on civil servants elsewhere did not apply in Hong Kong, where civil servants lead the government.
Broadfoot said he believed Chan and Tsang had decided to stay on to support Hong Kong through the transition, but he predicted their resignations within one year.
Chan is widely respected. ""A charmer and sophisticated with a core of steel,"" says one political insider.
She warned against any assault on the independence of the civil service by people with ""vested interests"" who were willing to invite China's intereference for their own benefit.
Chan said Tung was a man of principle but lacked  ""a really deep understanding of how government machinery works"".

4404,"Merging the Hong Kong dollar with China's renminbi is impossible in the short-term and unlikely in the long-term, a panel of experts said on Monday.
A currency merger could only be contemplated once China's capital account is fully open, allowing for free movement of financial assets in and out of the country, they told a conference organised by the Far Eastern Economic Review. They said this could take at least five years.
""Economically, the fact that the Renminbi is still not a fully-convertible currency also argues against a possible merging of the Hong Kong dollar with the Renminbi as Hong Kong needs a convertible currency to maintain its status as an international financial centre,"" said T.C. Chan, head of investment banking for Citibank in Hong Kong.
But Hong Kong can still look forward to 50 years of autonomous control of its monetary system, as enshrined in agreements governing Hong Kong's reversion to Chinese control and the Basic Law, Hong Kong's mini-constitution.
""If we set aside the political considerations, which are largely judgmental, the merging of the Hong Kong dollar with the Renminbi is simply legally not possible,"" Chan said.
Reforming state-owned enterprises (SOEs) will be key to convertibility for China, said Andrew Freris, Bank of America managing director in Hong Kong.
The SOEs, plagued by debt, have compromised China's banking sector. SOEs must be reformed to return integrity to China's banks, Freris told the conference.
Only when the banking sector has reduced its exposure to the SOEs will China be able to establish a fully-functioning interbank market, which can then act as the vehicle to establish market-determined interest rates, Freris said.
""The market must have the capacity to allow domestic rates (to) rise far enough to attract or repel capital,"" he said. ""If you do not have fully operational market-determined interest rates, convertibility is a non-starter.""
Instead of anticipating the eradication of its own currency, Hong Kong should look forward to convertibility of the Chinese yuan for the opportunities it will present, Freris said.
""Hong Kong will be able to derive more business from fund flows in and out of China,"" he said. ""But I do think that two monetary systems will remain separate. The fact the renminbi becomes convertible will not affect the separateness of the two systems.""
The idea of two monetary systems co-existing within one sovereign state is not unusual, Freris argued.
Argentina countered hyperinflation for many years by allowing its freely convertible peso to function alongside a U.S. ""dollarised"" economy.
Brazil and Uruguay are similarly dollarised, with U.S. currency used for all major transactions, he said.

4405,"Hong Kong's business and political leaders are gearing up to face a tough new world when the handover party is over.
Surrounded by rival Asian tiger economies, the territory can no longer rely on its historic role as the outside world's gateway to China to maintain its position as the world's seventh biggest trading economy.
""Our economic challenge is to improve Hong Kong's competitiveness in the new world order,"" future chief executive Tung Chee-hwa said in an interview with the South China Morning Post.
A quick glance at rivals Singapore, Shanghai, Kuala Lumpur and Tokyo has convinced Hong Kong's new leaders that drastic action is necessary.
Tung said Hong Kong had to become ""more compassionate and caring"" and tackle problems in education, housing and care of the elderly.
""Only if we succeed in meeting these challenges can we sustain our economic vitality and thereby continue to create wealth and improve the quality of life of all the people of Hong Kong,"" he declared.
""LIVELIHOOD"" ISSUES AT THE FOREFRONT
Tung's blend of economic and social policy into ""livelihood"" issues masks controversy over the prospect of government intervention in an economy dubbed the world's freest.
With a cash pile of HK$330 billion (US$42 billion) in reserves, Tung and his advisers have plenty of ammunition to fire at improvement targets.
Easy access to the cheap labour regions of southern China allowed Hong Kong's manufacturing base to explode and multiply when China opened its doors to foreign investment in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
Once a manufacturing base dependent on exports of labour-intensive, low-value goods, Hong Kong has been transformed into a service centre geared to China's emergence.
Manufacturing's contribution to Hong Kong's gross domestic product has plunged to single digits from more than 50 percent in the 1970s. Meanwhile, services have soared to 85 percent of GDP and are rising.
The speed of this process has amazed economists around the world -- and has created a new set of challenges for Hong Kong.
WAGES, PROPERTY CRUSH
The most obvious is a shortage of skilled workers.
""We need people, not machinery,"" George Leung, economic adviser at Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, said. ""This is the most serious issue in Hong Kong.""
Wage rates are rising, putting pressure on inflation rates even while unemployment rises -- a new phenomenon.
Demand is switching from high-labour, low-skilled jobs to white-collar occupations such as accountants, lawyers, managers and investment bankers.
The education system is ill-suited. Business leaders have called for government action to address a shortage of schools and properly qualified teachers.
""It's not a question of dumping money at the problem,"" Leung said. ""We need to come up with a helpful programme to train people and raise their quality. Otherwise, we will have no resources to expand our economy.""
With China's economy expected to double within the decade, Leung believes Hong Kong could face critical labour shortages in the next 10 years unless it acts aggressively now.
Rivals Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta and Tokyo are waiting to pounce on failure.
Tung has appointed one adviser to draw up a detailed education policy and asked another for guidance on how to tackle Hong Kong's critical property shortage.
Both wages and property make a major contribution to high costs, Hong Kong's major handicap in the competitiveness stakes. Rents and wages are higher than virtually anywhere else in Asia.

4408,"Rising corruption, declining English standards and an erosion in the overall quality of life cloud Hong Kong's future under China, the British Chamber of Commerce in the territory said on Thursday.
A survey of 196 British businesses operating in Hong Kong revealed key uncertainties for British business after the July 1 transition to Chinese sovereignty, despite an overall air of confidence in the future.
Half of those surveyed expected the rule of law to deteriorate, 72 percent forecast a decline in the quality of English and 85 percent were bracing for a rise in corruption.
""The overall message is one of British business confidence in Hong Kong, but that should be tempered by the realisation that business confidence is fragile,"" British chamber president Patrick Paul told reporters.
""Hong Kong has competitors within the region, such as Singapore and other locations, and I don't think Hong Kong can afford to be complacent,"" he said.
The survey revealed broad satisfaction with Hong Kong's communications network, its taxation and legal systems and its level of education.
But dissatisfaction surfaced in the costs of doing business, poor Sino-British relations and standards of English.
Looking to the future, most British businesses were optimistic about increased access to China, and they anticipated improvement in Sino-British trade as soon as handover-related hurdles were overcome.
But business costs, availability of skilled labour, English standards, quality of life and maintenance of the rule of law were all highlighted as sources of concern.
Echoing other surveys of ordinary Hong Kong people, a possible rise in corruption was by far the greatest source of worry associated with the return to Chinese sovereignty.
""The concern is whether or not that independent approach to dealing with corruption will be maintained,"" said chamber of commerce executive director Christopher Hammerbeck.
Paul said concerns about corruption flowing across the Chinese border into Hong Kong were offset by a highly transparent system that would quickly reveal any tampering, as well as an alert international business community.
""The British business community and the international business community will be watching,"" he said. ""If corruption becomes so bad that Hong Kong becomes a bad place for business -- I don't believe it will happen, but if it does -- business will doubtless vote with its feet.""
Even with a small rise in corruption, Hong Kong would remain one of the least-corrupt areas in Asia, he said.
Hammerbeck admitted that, as well as pollution, possible post-1997 discrimination against the British played a role in expectations of a deterioration in quality of life.
""It is a concern but that's not to say it will happen,"" he said.

4409,"The arrival in Hong Kong next week of a contingent of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) carries a symbolism far outweighing the numbers involved -- 40 unarmed soldiers.
After long and painful negotiations, Britain and China announced on Tuesday that in less than a week the PLA personnel would arrive in the territory as an advance guard prior to Britain's formal handover of the territory to China.
The sovereignty switch is not until the stroke of midnight on June 30, but the PLA personnel, who will not wear uniforms outside their barracks and will have no security role, will be an emphatic mark of Hong Kong's transition.
""This is the real thing. And the PLA, of course, has a central role in China and that also gives it significance,"" Michael DeGolyer political analyst at Hong Kong's Baptist University, told Reuters.
The diplomatic status of most other Chinese representative offices in Hong Kong, such as Xinhua News Agency and the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, had on occasion been uncertain, he said.
But there is no confusion about the status of the PLA. It is China's designated protector of both party and state.
""It will be interesting to see who they talk to,"" DeGolyer said. ""It would be appropriate to pay a courtesy call on the chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa.
""And it would be symbolically significant for the chief executive to meet with them simply because they are the first establishment of an official representation of sovereignty in the territory,"" he added.
Tung was appointed by China in December to become the first post-colonial leader, succeeding colonial Governor Chris Patten.
Details of the PLA deal were welcomed by some of those who had been previously alarmed by reports that a heavily armed advance guard might march into the territory before July 1.
Memories of the 1989 Beijing massacre, in which PLA soldiers crushed pro-democracy protests with heavy loss of life, remain vivid in Hong Kong.
""The PLA issue has been highly sensitive. At least they managed to persuade them not to come in heavily armed before July,"" said independent Democrat Emily Lau.
But senior government sources warned against reading any new mood of Sino-British reconciliation into the announcement.
""Politically, it's a minor sign they can agree on things but it really doesn't change things. I don't see any major turning point in this in terms of relationship,"" said PLA expert and political analyst Tai Ming Cheung.
In fact, there are increasing signs of strain in the Sino-British relationship.
On Monday, Beijing unilaterally announced who would qualify for permanent residency in Hong Kong after July 1.
The move prompted a rebuke from Britain for announcing a go-it-alone decision on an issue that it said should have been settled diplomatically.
Sources close to Patten said China cared less about the right of abode than it did about forcing the recognition of a Beijing-backed Provisional Legislature.
China insists that the provisional chamber will pass the residency law rather than the territory's existing elected Legislative Council, due for extinction on July 1.
Signs of a Sino-British standoff are evident everywhere as the colony's endgame unfolds and Britain, perceived by most Hong Kong people as increasingly irrelevant, packs its bags and prepares to leave town.
The only mainland China representation on Tuesday at a Foreign Correspondents Club reception for diplomats was a low-ranking Chinese official.
Xinhua director Zhou Nan, his senior deputies and China's chief handover negotiator Zhao Jihua, all stayed away.

4413,"Hong Kong's stock market has been reaching for record highs in anticipation of business as usual -- or maybe even better than usual -- after China takes control on July 1.
But the optimism is not shared by all.
As the handover approaches, the small but influential group surrounding former shipping magnate and future chief executive Tung Chee-hwa is having an anxiety attack about Hong Kong's competitiveness -- and with good reason, according to some.
Some of Tung's advisers even support intervening in Hong Kong's economy.
Everyone's inability to define, precisely, what it is that has made Hong Kong an economic marvel has prompted fears that some magical elixir will dissipate as soon as China takes charge at midnight on June 30.
A free port and strong markets, easy international access and firm defence of the rule of law are acknowledged as key underpinnings to Hong Kong's economic success.
But these features are common in cities around the world.
Most people believe that Hong Kong survives and thrives on a number of less quantifiable elements. Ranking high among these is the ""borrowed time, borrowed place"" mentality.
With the date July 1, 1997, etched in the backs of their minds, Chinese emigres worked against time in Hong Kong, using ingenuity and determination to transform themselves into some of the world's wealthiest people.
Often in the space of just a few years, the explosive energy of these time-sensitive tycoons spawned huge and diverse conglomerates, notable for their concentration of authority in the iron fist of the founder and his family.
But with China on the doorstep, Hong Kong has discovered that the days of rags-to-riches are not so much over as very, very different.
And that's where Hong Kong is having difficulty.
HONG KONG INC - JUST AN ACCIDENT?
Those who built Hong Kong Inc and know it best quietly fear its success was due more to accident than design, and that replication in the future will prove increasingly hard.
China's decision to slam its door shut following the 1949 Communist revolution forced Hong Kong to diversify away from its obvious strength as a deep-water port and trading entrepot.
Shanghai industrialists fled en masse to Hong Kong, bringing capital, know-how and drive, and a readiness to exploit cheap refugee labour flooding across the border from southern China.
""Hong Kong's natural advantage as an entry port to China disappeared. What emerged was an advantage in industry. Capital was there, management was there, labour was there,"" said Richard Wong, professor of economics at Hong Kong University.
It was a magic combination that established Hong Kong as a labour-intensive, low value-added manufacturing centre.
China's re-emergence into the world in the late 1970s merely added to the momentum. Hong Kong businessmen moved factories to where labour was cheaper -- into southern China.
It has been an intensive process that, 18 years later, is considered almost complete.
With the July 1 transition to Chinese rule now upon them, the Shanghai dynasties who made Hong Kong what it is today are asking, what next?
HONG KONG HARE RACING ASIAN TORTOISE
""We do not think that the present system can be sustained on its current trajectory,"" Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) professors Suzanne Berger and Richard Lester said in their study, ""Made by Hong Kong"".
MIT argues that, at some point, Hong Kong is going to have to stop seeking lower costs and start adding value. Labour costs are rising in south China, and factories are moving elsewhere.
MIT believes the incoming generation of ""Made by Hong Kong"" tycoons will have to shed the ""make a quick buck"" attitude of the past and invest for the long-term -- and they should do so soon because rising regional competition is starting to expose some obvious flaws in Hong Kong's short-term approach.
Almost like the hare that dashed ahead of the tortoise in the nursery tale, Hong Kong's ad hoc path to success could end up taking longer than the slow but steady course plotted by Asian tortoises like Singapore.
Singapore has already outpaced Hong Kong as the world's most competitive economy according to Harvard economist Jeffrey Sachs, who cites its better-educated and skilled workforce.
Singapore's labour and housing costs are lower and its English standards higher than in Hong Kong, reflecting the island's early recognition of its role as an Asian service centre in an increasingly competitive region.
""We are only now starting to talk about crafting competitive plans to attract the industries of tomorrow -- years after Singapore,"" one Hong Kong businessman told MIT.

4418,"Hong Kong's future leader Tung Chee-hwa has sparked fresh suspicions over China's plans for the territory by announcing changes to the lower tiers of government which critics see as a further rollback for democracy.
The move was followed on Tuesday by the release of a survey confirming a continued decline in political confidence in Hong Kong just days before the territory's return to Chinese rule.
On Monday Tung, who takes over as Hong Kong's chief executive on July 1, unveiled a system that will dilute democratic representation on second-tier government bodies through the appointment of a number of pro-China names.
Commentators welcomed the retention of all members of existing local councils and district boards but the Democratic Party, Hong Kong's most popular and vocal political group, saw the addition of pro-Beijing appointees as yet another attempt to roll back democracy in the dying days of British colonial rule.
""Mr Tung has put the old story back. It is a very bad message to the whole world that Hong Kong is going backward in terms of democracy,"" Democratic Party vice chairman Yeung Sum told government radio in Hong Kong.
""China resumes sovereignty over Hong Kong under the so-called (policy) 'Hong Kong ruling Hong Kong', (but) Mr. Tung has added the appointed system to the two councils as well as the district boards,"" said Yeung. ""It is very ironic.""
The confidence survey released on Tuesday was carried out by Baptist University of Hong Kong, which is monitoring local attitudes to the handover under its Transition Project.
""Political pessimism this time seems to have risen over the survey in February,"" political analyst Michael DeGolyer of Baptist University told Hong Kong radio.
The survey also underlines the division between economic and political confidence, with two-thirds of Hong Kong people confident about their economic future but uncertain about their political fate, DeGolyer said.
The findings confirm a prevailing attitude of ""doom and boom"" in Hong Kong, he said, with the stock market reaching new highs and red chips, or China-related stocks, roaring ahead on handover optimism while political confidence slides.
""Economic optimism has gone up, political pessimism has gone up. It's almost a kind of a schizophrenic attitude,"" he said.
Under Tung's changes, pro-Beijing names were handed the lion's share of 116 new appointed seats on urban and regional councils and district boards, the vast majority of whose existing members were elected under democratic reforms introduced i n 1994 by departing colonial governor Chris Patten.
Nine new members will be appointed to the Urban Council, which runs municipal affairs in Hong Kong proper while 11 new appointments will be made to the Regional Council, which performs municipal government functions in the New Territories.
Tung has also added another 96 appointed seats to Hong Kong's 18 District Boards, which advise the government on issues in various districts around the territory.
The changes, which take effect after the handover on July 1, complement plans to replace the territory's existing, elected legislature with an interim China-appointed body.
The interim legislature, which will govern Hong Kong until democratic elections promised within one year of the handover, has become a flashpoint of controversy between China and Western nations who object to the rollback of democracy in Hong Kong.
China, which was angered by Patten's reforms, has promised Hong Kong a staggered introduction of democracy.

4423,"An unskilled labour force is Hong Kong's biggest stumbling block to a successful future under China, Hongkong and Shanghai Bank economic adviser George Leung said on Friday.
""We need people, not machinery,"" Leung told Reuters, referring to Hong Kong's transformation into a service economy from the low-skilled manufacturing days of the past.
""This is the most serious issue in Hong Kong,"" Leung said.
""And it's not a case of dumping money at the problem. We need to come up with a helpful programme to train people and raise their quality. Otherwise, we will have no resources to expand our economy.""
An exploding service sector scrambling to meet the demands of the awakening Chinese economic giant has created a huge demand for properly qualified people in Hong Kong.
Investment bankers snowed under by listing applications from Chinese companies constantly complain they cannot find qualified workers, allowing barely-skilled expatriates to walk into highly-paid jobs far beyond their grasp back home.
The demand for all types of service professionals, such as lawyers, accountants, doctors, traders, analysts and others, has skyrocketed, putting upward pressure on overall wage rates and fuelling inflation.
The shortage can only get worse. China's economy is expected to double in size over the next decade, and Hong Kong's school system is unequipped to meet the new demand.
A shortage of school space is forcing Hong Kong's future workforce to attend school in shifts, and studies show Hong Kong students score lower in mathematics and science tests than rivals elsewhere in Asia.
This problem threatens to turn into a crisis within the decade, Leung warned. Under current circumstances, Hong Kong will be unable to find sufficient expatriates to meet its needs, possibly allowing centres such as Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Tokyo to step in to meet demand.
Standards of English, the language of international commerce, are already considered to be lower in Hong Kong than in Singapore.
They will worsen further following the reversion of sovereignty to China on July 1, with an increasing emphasis on Mandarin as the common language of China rather than English, a legacy of a period considered shameful to China.
""We have got to place more emphasis on this otherwise we will be at a disadvantage,"" Leung said.
Anybody who doubted the importance of English to Hong Kong needed only turn to Tokyo, said Leung, where a lack of language ability had caused Japan to lag Hong Kong and Singapore as an Asia-Pacific financial centre, despite Japan's bigger markets.
Hong Kong's future leader Tung Chee-hwa has appointed a special task force to review the education system, which Leung said was a good idea.
""At least they know it is one of the most important factors affecting Hong Kong,"" Leung said.
But he is waiting to see what recommendations surface, calling for practical steps to massively upgrade the labour force's skill sets to match Hong Kong's new economic identity.

4440,"A spectre of central planning seems to have settled over Hong Kong just as its future sovereign, China, tries to loosen the last chains of Stalinist economic doctrine.
Economic intervention heads the agenda of a number of hand-picked advisers to future Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa, many of them urging action to keep Hong Kong competitive in a region full of booming Asian ""tiger"" states.
Proposals so far include a government-funded science park, tax breaks to lure multinationals, a venture capital fund for high-tech businesses and most recently, a cross-border zone with an industrial park on the Hong Kong side and would-be immigrants on the Chinese side.
It all suggests a major policy shift on July 1, when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese control -- and a marked departure from the sort of free-wheeling past that saw Hong Kong dubbed ""the world's freest economy"" by the U.S.-backed Heritage Foundation.
The idea of state funding for business is anathema to Hong Kong, where a strict separation between government and business has long been considered essential to economic success.
""Hong Kong is like a Rolls Royce. All you need to do if you're in charge is slip into the drivers's seat, switch on the ignition, and away you go. I don't quite see the point of lifting the bonnet to tinker with the engine,"" said departing colonial governor Chris Patten.
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang, the man who balances the territory's books, recently gave a speech pledging government help for the economy -- but only after the private sector had taken the lead.
A SIGN OF THE TIMES ... AND NEW FACES
This is a hot topic in Hong Kong as it speeds towards unification with China on July 1. It is also one of the most important signs that faces are changing along with the times.
Over the past 15 years Hong Kong's economic success was virtually guaranteed by its location next to southern China's economic boom, the biggest on record.
But wage rates in southern China are no longer cheap. Vietnam and central Chinese provinces closer to Shanghai now offer lower pay than Guangdong, and even tougher competitors lurk on the horizon in India and elsewhere.
Hong Kong already suffers from stratospheric wage rates and property prices. And with most large Asian centres scrambling for service income higher up the economic food-chain, Hong Kong faces stiff competition from rival ""baby dragons"" such as Singapore.
Unnerved by an almost complete dependence upon services, Singapore recently altered its foreign exchange policy to support a lagging industrial base and declining exports.
Over the past 15 years, Hong Kong has experienced a similar decline in its own export base. Services now account for a rising 85 percent of gross domestic product while domestic exports continue to decline.
They are being replaced by soaring re-exports, goods shipped through Hong Kong for processing -- most of them to China -- in a trend that reflects the relocation of virtually Hong Kong's entire manufacturing base into southern China.
It all begs the question of just how vulnerable Hong Kong wants to become to the fundamental economics of regions outside its immediate influence.
Economists say diversification is a good idea to minimise risk associated with such a high dependence upon services, and opportunities could become more available after July 1.
Hong Kong entrepreneurs could soon gain easier access to Chinese land and labour that will enable the development of a high-tech sector, said economist Kevin Chan at Salomon Brothers.
""After July 1 we may be able to draw directly on resources from the mainland that would enable us to develop a high-tech manufacturing sector,"" he said. ""We will have a better foundation on which to do this.""
SHAPING HONG KONG IN THEIR OWN IMAGE
Many of the well-educated, well-heeled businessmen who hold Tung's confidence believe that intervention is essential to secure Hong Kong's long-term future.
With HK$330 billion (US$42.3 billion) in fiscal reserves, they have the means as well as the determination to effect great change. And if there is any opposition to the new proposals, it is unlikely to win a sympathetic hearing.
Most of these privileged tycoons and technocrats espouse elitist, almost anti-democratic views, having been raised in the autocratic, do-or-die tradition of Asian family business.
""There has been too much pandering to public opinion by the legislature,"" Leung Chun-ying, the property surveyor asked to map out a long-term housing strategy for the territory, told the Far Eastern Economic Review recently.
Two sources have been most outspoken about the new mood of intervention that marks the men closest to Tung.
Henry Tang, head of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries and a member of Tung's inner cabinet, is reported to have been asked to map out an industrial policy for Hong Kong.
James Tien, a pro-intervention businessman, is a high-profile member of the Provisional Legislature, the interim body that will replace the existing legislature on July 1.

4442,"Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd said on Monday it expects most of its grounded Airbus Industrie A330-300 aircraft to be back up and running within three weeks.
The British Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), meanwhile, urged PT Garuda Indonesia to ground its A330-300 fleet, the Civil Aviation Department (DCA) of Hong Kong said.
Cathay's fleet of 11 Airbuses was grounded on Saturday, the day after a Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engine failed on a Hong Kong Dragon Airlines (Dragonair) flight and forced the plane to make an emergency landing on one engine in the Philippines.
It was the fifth time since November that a Cathay Pacific or Dragonair A330-300 had made a single-engine landing. Rolls-Royce said on Friday that gearbox bearings were to blame for the problems with the Trent 700s, which were introduced in March 1995.
Dragonair, owned 25.5 percent by Cathay, has also suspended operations of its fleet of four A330-300 aircraft.
Roland Fairfield, engineering director for Cathay Pacific, told reporters that Rolls-Royce had proposed a modification to the Trent 700 engine gearbox, which the companies hoped to start incorporating into the Airbus fleet within one week.
""We expect the aircraft to commence re-entering service on a progressive basis in approximately one week's time,"" he said.
""The rate at which the remainder of the fleet enters service is going to be very much a function of how fast manufacturers can supply modification kits and we can get them embodied into the gearboxes, but I would expect at this stage that from the commencement of re-entry of the aircraft into service, the entire fleet will be back flying within two weeks of that date.""
Hong Kong's DCA said in a statement that the British CAA call for Garuda to ground its A330-300 fleet had prompted the DCA to tell Garuda that its services to Hong Kong ""should only be operated by aircraft other than"" Trent-powered A330s.
But Garuda said earlier it would only ground the airplane if there were an order from the aircraft maker or from the engine maker.
Stressing their primary commitment to safety, Cathay and Dragonair declined to give any indication of costs of the suspension, or its impact on 1997 profits.
""Clearly at the appropriate time in the appropriate way we will be discussing these issues,"" said Tony Tyler, director of corporate development.
""It is too early to make such comments we are all aware there are regulations covering what we can and cannot say ...stock market regulations ... and at this stage we are not in a position to comment on that particular feature of this issue.""
But analysts expected some erosion of 1997 profits, which some had forecast at HK$4 billion before the suspension. One analyst said the impact would depend largely on how long the fleet remained dormant.
Another analyst, Mark Simpson at Schroder Securities, said he was reducing his earnings forecasts for Cathay, but added that Rolls-Royce would almost certainly help defray Cathay's costs and reduce the bottom line impact.
Cathay declined to reveal whether any compensation agreement with Rolls-Royce was under discussion.
""We're not in the habit of disclosing the financial arrangements that go on with our suppliers,"" Tyler said.

4445,"The grounding of Cathay Pacific's Airbus fleet is just the latest blow for Hong Kong's flagship carrier, and analysts warned the picture was unlikely to improve soon.
After a turbulent five years, Cathay Pacific was starting to represent good fundamental value, with strong management, a healthy balance sheet and promised expansion with the April 1998 opening of Hong Kong's new airport at Chek Lap Kok.
""There have been some problems but now things seem to be going their way,"" said K.Y. Ng at BZW Asia.
However, that has not translated into a positive share price performance, and many Hong Kong analysts -- including Ng -- have a sell recommendation on the stock.
""I'm not saying this counter is poor fundamentally,"" said Andrew Fernow at Vickers Ballas. ""But we don't think it can perform in line. The market is being driven by China-related factors and U.S. interest rates and Cathay isn't benefitting.""
Cathay's share price barely moved on news that its Airbus 330-300 fleet had been grounded because of problems with its Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engine.
From a high of HK$14.80 last June, the stock has been trading at about $12 per share for the past four months, failing to gain from record highs on Hong Kong's Hang Seng index. The stock closed Tuesday's morning session at HK$11.70.
""It's a laggard,"" another analyst said.
Most analysts said they were negative on Cathay before the Airbus grounding, but they were also unconvinced by reports of massive losses associated with the problem.
They estimated costs at about HK$200 million after compensation, and said it was unclear at this point how they would be managed. Some costs would be offset by a stronger yen.
Those analysts forecasting 1997 earnings at HK$3.6 billion were holding steady while those with higher estimates of HK$4.0 billion or above were expected to make downward revisions.
At a news conference on Monday the company declined comment on expected losses.
The engine failure is the latest blow for Cathay, which also faces labour unrest and a decline in Japanese tourism heading into what had expected to be a strong summer as travellers flock in for the territory's July 1 handover to China..
""That (Japanese tourism) would be a bigger factor than the loss of the engines,"" said Mark Simpson at Schroder Securities.
Analysts said Cathay's problems started with a strike in 1993 and culminated with China National Aviation Corp's (CNAC) threat last year to compete directly with Cathay in Hong Kong.
In a compromise deal, CNAC instead bought 36 percent of Hong Kong Dragon Airlines (Dragonair), mostly from Cathay Pacific and Swire Pacific Ltd
One of Hong Kong's oldest British ""hongs"" or trading houses, Swire owns 44 percent of Cathay with another 25 percent held by China's CITIC Pacific Ltd Swire and Cathay together hold about 26 percent of Dragonair.
China's evident interest in grabbing a piece of Hong Kong's lucrative aviation sector has cast a cloud over Cathay's future.
""What will the competitive picture be in Hong Kong (after Hong Kong reverts to China on July 1),"" asked Fernow. ""One can conclude it's not going to get better, it's going to get worse. The extent to which they will get routes in China is not known.""
If it does, Cathay will be competing against Dragonair, persuading some analysts to forecast a disposal of Cathay's stake in the airline. Others were expecting Cathay to move into high-margin North American routes dominated by overseas Chinese.
But rumours persist that, in the face of such uncertainty, Swire will divest its Cathay stake -- a rumour Swire has denied.
""What do you expect them to say,"" said another analyst. ""I'm getting tired of people putting the boots into this company.""

4448,"Hong Kong democracy activists will raise the stakes this week in a bid to bring international pressure on Beijing over its plans to curtail political and civil liberties in the territory.
Martin Lee, the leader of Hong Kong's Democratic Party who is in the United States to lobby against China's plans, will meet with U.S. Secretary of State Madelein Albright on Monday and U.S. President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore sometime in the week.
Lee received a warm welcome last week in an address to the U.S. Senate's Foreign Relations Committee, in which he pleaded for U.S. support for democracy in the territory after it reverts to Chinese rule.
""How the U.S. and other Democratic countries of the world react to China's many breaches of the joint declaration will make the difference in whether Hong Kong remains the free society it is today or whether the democratic elections, human rights and the rule of law Hong Kong people have heretofore known and cherished will be extinguished,"" Lee told U.S. senators on Thursday.
Despite assurances of substantial automony under handover agreements, Beijing has begun moves to change civil liberties laws, including the Bill of Rights, a 1992 election law and a law on creation of political parties.
Future chief executive Tung Chee Hwa last week unveiled additional plans to restrict public protests and foreign funding for political organisations from July 1, when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese control after more than 150 years as a British colony.
Beijing considers the most recent proposals essential for compliance with the Basic Law, Hong Kong's post-handover constitution. But democracy activists in Hong Kong see them as further signs of an erosion of basic rights and freedoms now enjoyed by the territory's 6.4 million people.
""It is tantamount to taking away the rights...recognised by the constitution, that are recognised by international covenants,"" Democratic Party member Albert Ho said last week.
The proposals also have been condemned by the colonial government and last week drew admonition from the Clinton administration, which called them ""disturbing"".
Beijing reacted angrily to the comments, accusing Washington of meddling in Chinese affairs.
But a poll by a Hong Kong newspaper indicated that dissatisfaction with Tung was growing at home as well.
The poll of 803 people residents, released by the Ming Pao newspaper on Sunday, showed Tung's popularity has hit a new low since his office unveiled the plans to amend Hong Kong's civil liberty laws.
The newspaper said the rating of Tung's fitness for the post of chief executive had slipped 5 percent to 4.65 points on a scale of zero to 10. Meanwhile, his ""trustworthiness"" rating sank 10 percent to 4.35.
It said the survey was done after Tung's office made proposals on two key laws -- the Public Order Ordinance and the Societies Ordinance, to curb protests and foreign funding for political groups in Hong Kong after the British colony reverts to China on July 1.
As the sovereignty transition nears, however, nothing is expected to derail Beijing from implementing its plans.
""To Beijing, time is running out for dilly-dallying on procedural and formal matters. It is time for action and decision because there is work to do in the next 80 days,"" the South China Morning Post newspaper said.
Meeting across the border in the Chinese city of Shenzhen to avoid threats of legal action by the Democrats, future Hong Kong lawmakers on Saturday agreed on a formula to enact laws that would govern the territory after July 1.
Condemned by the Democrats as unconstitutional and illegal, the Chinese-annointed Provisional Legislature is proceeding with readings of about a dozen bills that Tung believes must be passed before July 1.
But concern is mounting that the Provisional Legislature, in its haste, will ram through loophole-filled laws that will be easy to undermine.
""Laws full of loopholes and ambiguities -- and a legislative process vulnerable to challenge -- would become a source of more friction and legal dispute,"" the South China Morning Post warned.

4459,"China is on target with plans to to promote 100 large chemical groups by 2000 by tapping a $1.6 billion war chest, Minister of Chemical Industry Gu Xiulian said on Friday.
The industry hoped that 10 of the groups, which are being groomed to compete in the export market, could eventually list their shares either on domestic or foreign stock exchanges, she said.
""Currently, we have 13.6 billion yuan ($1.6 billion) to support development plans,"" Gu told reporters. ""Some of this was made available under the previous five-year plan (1991-1995). All of the money is to support development projects.""
China has been trying to promote big companies to give its ailing state sector a more competitive edge.
""One of the problems in the industry is that we've had too much small-scale production which was protected under central planning. But now we have a market economy,"" Gu said.
The government aimed to build up companies which could each export $10 million worth of chemicals a year. There were now 80 such companies, she added.
Asked about plans to publicly list the firms, Gu did not name any company or group but said the ministry's policy was to support companies ready to go public.
Listing plans would then require approval by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, China's top securities watchdog.
Chemical companies Tianjin Bohai Chemical Industry (Group) Co Ltd and Jilin Chemical Industry Co Ltd are some of the companies listed in China and abroad.
Gu said some of the state-run chemical companies were among the firms losing money, and that subsidiaries were needed to offset rising raw material costs. She did not mention any companies by name but said chemical fertilisers were one area where subsidiaries were necessary.

4469,"China is expected to unveil a cautious budget this weekend, avoiding bold but risky moves in 1997, the crucial year of the recovery of Hong Kong and a major meeting of the Communist Party elite, economists said on Friday.
The 1997 budget would again show a hefty deficit although it could be smaller than the 61.442 billion yuan ($7.4 billion) estimate for 1996, they said.
""This should be a year for a steady-as-she-goes budget,"" said a foreign diplomat who follows economic issues.
Finance Minister Liu Zhongli is expected to announce the budget to the National People's Congress, or parliament, on Sunday or Monday.
The recovery of the British colony of Hong Kong at midnight on June 30 and the scheduling of the Communist Party congress for later in the year will most likely ensure cautious fiscal policies, economists said.
Beijing wants to see the Hong Kong handover proceed smoothly and its leaders have little inclination to take risks ahead of the congress which will set policies and decide who gets the top jobs for the next five years. Beijing's leaders also have an added reason for caution as they can no longer rely on the steadying hand of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, who died this month.
""I am not looking for anything startling in the budget,"" said another foreign diplomat.
Even if the deficit is not reduced this year, it will still be manageable. Last year's deficit was only 0.99 percent of estimated 1996 gross domestic product.
Economists said they expected to see higher tax revenues this year as China's economy grows at a steady pace and tax collection improves.
China has already forecast economic growth of 10.5 percent for the year, up from 9.7 percent recorded in 1996. Premier Li Peng on Saturday is to set a yet more cautious goal of 8.0 percent growth.
State revenues expanded 18.1 percent in the first 11 months of last year, and economists said more efficient tax collection and better management of state finances were key factors.
Inflation will also be relatively modest this year, limiting upward pressure on government spending. Retail price inflation is forecast at less than the 6.1 percent of 1996.
Despite lower interest rates, Beijing will need to meet increased payments of interest and principal on past debts, said economist Li Yang, of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
""This will mean more bonds will be issued this year,"" he said.
Economists said, however, this was not a major concern as it was largely in line with China's efforts to issue more tradeable debt to create an active secondary market and strengthen its financial sector.
But a cautious budget will mean China cannot afford to make deep cuts in subsidies to ailing state industry in 1997.
Many overstaffed state companies badly need to shed workers from their payrolls but Beijing's leaders are fearful this could lead to social unrest.
Economists will also be watching the military budget closely, where further increases in spending are expected.
Deng's chosen successor, President and Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin, needs the support of the army to retain his grip on power.
In his eulogy for Deng, Jiang referred to the army as the ""pillar of the state"".
China has said it wants to reduce the size of its three-million-strong army but it is likely to more than offset savings with stepped up spending on advanced weaponry, analysts said.

4470,"China has scored new successes in its fight against inflation and economists said on Friday that price rises this year could be well below target.
Some economists say inflation has been squeezed out of the economy with only a modest impact on growth as economic expansion continued at a fairly rapid pace.
""This is better than expected,"" said Chen Dezun, head of the price research institute of the State Planning Commission.
""We could see inflation of between three and four percent this year,"" he told Reuters. The benchmark retail price index rose a meagre 1.7 percent in March and 2.6 percent for the first quarter of the year, the State Statistical Bureau said on Thursday.
China forecast a 6.0 percent rise in retail prices this year after a 6.1 percent increase last year. That was already well below the 14.8 percent recorded in 1995 and a communist-era high of 21.7 percent in 1994.
China's economic growth is expected to top 10 percent this year after a solid 9.7 percent in 1996.
The inflation figure for the first quarter was also below an estimate by Premier Li Peng this week that retail price inflation would average 3.0 percent in the January-March period.
Chen said good weather had been a factor, ensuring steady supplies of agricultural goods and keeping prices down.
What China officially refers to as ""appropriately tight"" monetary policies had also been a crucial factor, he said.
""The appropriately tight monetary policies are now showing results,"" he said.
China has kept controls on fixed asset investment, keeping government spending down, and that has kept a cap on the demand for goods such as construction materials.
After adjusting for inflation, the real rise in fixed asset investment last year was a fairly modest 11.5 percent.
""The key has been control over fixed asset investment,"" said Zhong Jiyun, an economist at the state think tank, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
Some economists have argued that with the battle against inflation proceeding favourably, China can now afford to ease its monetary policies.
Many inefficient state-run enterprises are swimming in red ink and saddled with debt they cannot repay.
Managers of these companies and their local government officials have called for easier credit to help to reduce their heavy financial burden.
But Zhong is among the economists who believe that China is not yet able to declare the war on inflation over.
""I believe we still need to keep the controls on,"" he said.

4477,"The Australian stock exchange on Tuesday used the China visit of Prime Minister John Howard to make a high profile sales pitch for Chinese companies to list shares on Australia's stock market.
The Australian prime minister, before meeting China's President Jiang Zemin, found time to open a seminar for China's market regulators and top-level managers of its state-run companies designed to show them why they should look to Australia to raise capital.
Senior officials from the Australian Stock Exchange as well as brokerages and legal firms delivered the message that Australia had much to offer.
""Cross-border equities trading now amounts to around $4 trillion a year, which no stock market can afford to ignore,"" Australian Stock Exchange chairman Maurice Newman told the seminar.
""I hope that one day we may be able to welcome you to our market.""
Most Chinese companies that have listed their shares abroad have chosen Hong Kong where investors have been snapping up China-related stocks.
One recent listing of a China-linked company was nearly 900 times oversubscribed, and Australia may find it difficult to generate that kind of interest.
Newman later told reporters that 19 of 31 Asian-owned companies on the Australian exchange already had a China connection. These companies have often used a corporation not based in China to make the listing, in effect sidestepping regulatory curbs in their home country.
Trading in some of those issues has not been active.
""The liquidity of those companies is mixed,"" said Newman. ""As a group we would prefer that it were greater.""
Australia may soon get its first direct Chinese listing.
Taihang Cement, a cement producer based in the northern province of Hebei, has already gained approval from Chinese regulatory authorities for a foreign listing.
Company officials told reporters they hoped to list their shares in Australia by the year-end.
""We chose Australia because we have a foundation there,"" said Zhang Zhixian, Taihang's manager of investment development, noting that the company exports cement to Australia.
Company officials said the exact size of the offer had not been set but would range between 100 and 200 million yuan ($12-24 million).
Other participants at the seminar said Australia might target its efforts at sectors where Australia is already strong, such as in natural resources.
""Australia would have a natural advantage in infrastructure and resource-based companies,"" said Tony Greenwood, of law firm Blake Dawson Waldron, noting the heavy weighting of such stocks in Australia.
One area of concern for Chinese companies will be financial transparency, which has posed a problem for them in the past.
Some Chinese companies have had trouble complying with domestic regulations and others have come under criticism in Hong Kong for lack of transparency.
""Our concern must also be the integrity of our market,"" said Newman.
""It is important that companies are familiar with our listing requirements and they observe them faithfully.""

4479,"A top Chinese official for contacts with Taiwan ruled out an early resumption of talks on reunification because the island's leaders were pursuing ""splittist"" policies, the China Daily said on Tuesday.
It also quoted Tang Shubei, vice-chairman of the Association for Relations across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), as saying that Taiwanese authorities did not want the handover of Hong Kong to go smoothly and might try to disrupt the transfer of power.
""In the long term the mainland and Taiwan should sit down at the negotiating table to discuss cross-straits issues under the 'one-China' policy,"" Tang was quoted as saying.
But he said the atmosphere for talks would not improve in the short term unless Taiwan's leaders, including its ""so-called"" President Lee Teng-hui, halted their ""splittist"" activities aimed at independence for the island.
China and Taiwan have been rivals since the Nationalist government fled to the island after its defeat by the communists in the Chinese civil war in 1949.
Beijing regards Taiwan as a renegade province and tries to isolate it diplomatically.
Talks between the two sides were broken off after President Lee made a landmark private visit to the United States in mid-1995, enraging Beijing.
""We have the patience to handle the issue of the peaceful reunification of the motherland,"" Tang said.
The newspaper also said Taiwan authorities would likely take measures to reduce the impact on the island from the success of China's policies towards Hong Kong, which reverts to Beijing sovereignty on July 1 after 150 years of British rule.
""According to Tang, there is information that Taiwan forces in Hong Kong are planning to cause trouble, such as demonstrations around July 1, when China resumes its exercise of sovereignty over the territory,"" the newspaper said.
Tang also repeated Beijing's long-held stance that the United States should halt arms sales to Taiwan.
The Chinese official's remarks were published by the English language newspaper as the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, was visiting Taiwan.
Beijing insists the 1989 winner of the Nobel Peace prize is waging a campaign for independence for Tibet.
Tang made no mention of Beijing's announcement last week that it would return a Taiwanese man suspected of hijacking a Taiwan passenger jet to mainland China.
Beijing wants Taiwan to return Chinese hijackers now in Taiwanese jails but so far it has been disappointed.

4481,"China published on Saturday a list of anti-dumping rules to protect local companies from unfair foreign competition.
Chinese economists said the rules would help domestic companies, many of them targets of similar dumping claims overseas, protect their share of the domestic market.
They also said the move appeared to be aimed at giving a legal framework to protection from unfair competition and clarifying procedures for its use.
""Many Chinese companies are unable to compete in the face of unfair trade practices,"" economist Cheng Xiusheng of the State Council (cabinet) development research centre told Reuters.
""Many other countries have imposed anti-dumping duties against Chinese products and China needs a system to regulate its own market and protect its companies,"" he said.
The rules, published in the official People's Daily, give the government the right to determine whether imported goods are aided by official subsidies and impose anti-dumping duties on foreign goods. Cash guarantees can be demanded to ensure payment.
Prices in the exporting country or third countries will be used to determine a fair price for goods in dispute and set a countervailing duty.
The rules also provide guidelines for domestic companies to file complaints about unfair competition and set a maximum length of 12 months for an investigation. Special cases are allowed to take 18 months. The rules also empower the state to take retaliatory measures against countries that impose ""discriminatory"" countervailing duties against Chinese goods.
Beijing's official media have said the dumping of foreign goods on the domestic market had cost China some 10 billion yuan ($1.2 billion) a year and had caused the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs.
Many domestic manufacturers were pressuring the government to take steps to offset these policies, newspapers have said.
Other economists said China was trying to codify the protection of its industries and bring its trade policies more in line with international practice.
They added that as China sought to join the World Trade Organisation it was being forced to make its polices more transparent.

4489,"China hit back on Tuesday at U.S. accusations of human rights abuses, saying Washington was distorting facts while turning a blind eye to problems in its own back yard.
In a lengthy riposte to U.S. State Department criticism of China in its annual report on human rights, Beijing described the United States as a land of guns, terrorist bomb attacks and racial discrimination.
China's angry attack, carried by the official Xinhua news agency and titled: ""A Look at the U.S. Human Rights Record"", also said American-style political democracy was a game of the rich and faulted the U.S. constitution for providing inadequate guarantees.
The U.S. report, released in January, accused Beijing of effectively silencing public dissent in 1996 through jailings, intimidation or exile.
China said the State Department was ""once again distorting and attacking at length the state of human rights in China and more than 190 other countries and regions"".
""The U.S. government, posing as the 'human rights judge of the world', turned a blind eye yet again to the serious human rights problems in its own country,"" Xinhua said.
""There are 220 million firearms in private hands, which translates into nearly one gun per person,"" it said. ""Armed criminals are on the rampage, shootings are non-stop and a large number of innocent people have fallen prey to violence.""
Xinhua cited the deadly 1993 World Trade Centre bombing in New York, the 1995 bombing in Oklahoma City and the explosion during the Olympic Games in Atlanta last year as symptoms of America's deep-rooted problems.
""It is not accidental that terrorist bomb attacks continuously occur in the United States, an excessively violent country where terrorism is deeply rooted in society.""
The news agency said the United States had one of the world's largest police forces relative to its population and the largest prison population.
The report described crowded U.S. prisons as places where ""prison guards mounted on horseback keep watch on inmates as though they are herding animals"".
""Inmates are sometimes forced to fight among themselves and are whipped"".
It condemned pervasive racial discrimination, saying blacks and other ethnic minorities had always been second-class citizens.
The agency went on to say the United States had a less than exemplary record abroad, inflicting human rights violations on other nations through wars and acts of aggression throughout its history.

""Without question, this is a groundbreaking move for AT&amp;T,"" said Joseph Nacchio, executive vice president of AT&amp;T's consumer and small business division.
Shaklee, part of Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. of Japan, currently sells nutritional supplements, personal care products, household cleaners, and water treatment products.
It is particularly strong among ethnic minorities, non-English speakers and in inner cities. These markets can be tough to crack by other routes, but quite lucrative.
""Shaklee will help us expand our personal presence in communities exponentially and create a whole new network of representatives with roots in neighbourhoods across the country,"" Nacchio said.
To start with, Shaklee will sell only AT&amp;T's long-distance calling plans, but AT&amp;T wants to sell new services too once the sales force is trained on their complexities.
""AT&amp;T would like to give Shaklee that opportunity,"" said Shaklee spokeswoman Karin Topping.
The move shows AT&amp;T is neither too big nor too proud to take a leaf out of the marketing books of its competitors.
Small aggressive competitors like Excel Communications Inc. have powered their growth through exactly this kind of ""multi-level"" marketing. The approach is so named because each salesperson recruits others, and continues to benefit from their recruits' sales efforts as they rise up the hierarchy.
MCI Communications Corp. has a similar relationship with direct sales organisation Amway Corp.
""Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. And it certainly validates this sales strategy,"" said Eric Strumingher, industry analyst at brokers Chicago Corp. ""I think this could be very significant for AT&amp;T,"" he said.
For AT&amp;T the alliance is aimed at reaching new customers cheaply, and keeping them.
AT&amp;T's market share in the $70 billion long-distance market has sunk to about 55 percent from 90 percent over the last decade. They have been hit not only by traditional rivals MCI and Sprint Corp., but a host of tiny new competitors.
Recent attempts to regain customers by offering $100 checks have been expensive but without increasing loyalty, so Thursday's initiative marks a new departure.
""We do believe the nature of this sales channel will be much more likely to increase loyalty and retention among customers,"" Jack McMaster, AT&amp;T's vice president for domestic consumer long distance, said in an interview.
Shacklee salespeople sell to their friends and neighbours. Customers are expected to be more reluctant to switch away from a service recommended by a friend.
""It's potentially much more lucrative than selling lipstick or vitamin supplements for the salesperson,"" said David Goodtree, an analyst at consultancy Forrester Research.
Shaklee said an average salesperson earns $14,000 a year part time, with earnings ranging from $1,000 a month at the entry level to six figures for the long-established.
Shaklee said that cars and vacations would typically be incentives for upper echelon sales representatives.
For AT&amp;T a crucial question will be the value of the customers won in terms of their long-distance spending, and the chances of selling new services like satellite television, pagers or mobile phones to them too.
AT&amp;T wants all of Shacklee's half million salespeople to be involved with the programme, which means they must be AT&amp;T customers themselves.
""It is our ambition that all of them will participate in this programme,"" McMaster said.
This will mean a boost of several hundred thousand good customers who will not be able to switch, even before the sales effort gets underway.
""Thats one of the reasons we are so excited about this,"" McMaster said.
AT&amp;T's stock edged down 12.5 cents to $37.125 on the New York Stock Exchange.

4510,"Aerospace company Hughes Electronics Corp heads the list of bidders to buy satellite services provider PanAmSat Corp with a strong offer, a source close to the talks said on Friday.
""I think they are just looking at the best offers on the table now,"" the source told Reuters, adding that Hughes' offer was currently about the best on the table.
Both PanAmSat and Hughes declined to comment on what they called speculative reports. Hughes is part of General Motors Corp.  
However, Hughes chief executive Mike Armstrong told Reuters on Wednesday that the company was considering a multi-billion dollar acquisition in aerospace and defense.
""We are always looking at ventures that will make our business grow"" said Hughes spokeswoman Marcy Garber.
Analysts say PanAmSat could be worth $3.5 billion or more, a substantial premium over the $2.75 billion market capitalization of the company. The stock was trading at 27-3/8, up 3/8 late on Friday morning.  
The source, who spoke on condition of not being identified, said that talks are continuing, but no deal is imminent. He would not say how much Hughes was offering.
PanAmSat's majority owners are Grupo Televisa SA of Mexico and the family of founder Rene Anselmo, which each own 40.5 percent of the company's 100 million shares. The rest are publicly traded.
""Rene Anselmo did a great job and took a lot of risks, and now his benefactors are going to reap the rewards,"" said analyst Jimmy Schaeffler of the Carmel Group.  
In April Televisa and the Anselmo family asked investment bankers Morgan Stanley to find a takeover or joint venture partner for the company, or to plan a secondary stock issue.
The source said that Televisa preferred a sale option, though the Anselmo family had no preference.
Other rumored bidders include Lockheed Martin Corp, General Electric Co Loral Space &amp; Communications Ltd, and Deutsche Telekom of Germany according to press reports.
PanAmSat has a unique franchise as the only global competitor to Intelsat, which is owned by numerous governments and was set up under a treaty.
PanAmSat's customers include a vast array of international broadcasters from Time Warner Inc to News Corp, the British Broadcasting Corp and China Central TV.
Schaeffler said its expansion plans put it in a powerful position for new services and covering new areas like Africa and the central Asian republics which so far have no western satellite coverage. -- New York Newsroom 212 859 1712

4513,"AT&amp;T Corp. on Wednesday said basic U.S. rates for state-to-state calls made from a home would rise by 5.9 percent effective Dec 1., adding an average 60 cents a month to the typical residential bill.
The company said it was raising rates to pay for investments made to broaden its service line, build technical infrastructure and improve customer service.
Small business call rates will rise 4.8 percent for international, toll free and some other services.
The Basking Ridge, N.J.-based company is raising the cost of calls made with a calling card by 5 percent and those made with the assistance of an AT&amp;T operator by 2.6 percent.
It also said it would increase monthly fees on its Reach Out America, SelectSaver and AnyHour Saver calling plans. AT&amp;T said it stopped marketing those plans in 1993 when it introduced its ""True"" family of calling plans.
However, rates on the True savings plans will also rise, an AT&amp;T spokesman confirmed, because they are based on a percentage discount from the basic rate. The new One Rate plan introduced this fall will not be affected as it is flat rate.
AT&amp;T stock rose 87.5 cents to $39.25 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
AT&amp;T last raised rates in February, with a 4.3 percent increase. The previous increase was in December 1994.
Asked why announcement of the latest rate hike was made Wednesday, when most peoples' attention was on Thursday's Thanskgiving holiday, an AT&amp;T spokesman said, ""It is a coincidence.""
Analysts said the increases continue the policy adopted by most big long-distance companies of increasing basic long distance rates while promoting more generous calling plans to satisfy those customers who are price sensitive.
""In the last three or four years long-distance prices have actually been going up,"" said industry analyst Jeffrey Kagan, who runs his own consulting firm.
He said that AT&amp;T and others were trying to build up some fat ahead of the battle in 1997, when regional Bells are expected to drive into long distance markets in force and push rates lower.
In the meantime, he said, it pays for customers to take a hard look once a year at the call rates they are paying, and to choose the calling plan best for them.
""Only a third of long distance customers are actually on calling plans at all, and it is the rest who are paying the freight,"" Kagan said.
AT&amp;T also launched a cut-rate, international call-back service in Tokyo on Wednesday. In a call-back service, users first call a switching centre in the United States and calls are then connected at cost-effective U.S. rates.
The Tokyo call-back service marks the first time AT&amp;T has started such a service, AT&amp;T Asia/Pacific President John Legere said.
""We are the first major telecommunications carrier in Japan to introduce a low-cost, flat-rate international calling option,"" he said.
AT&amp;T's Japanese unit said it would charge 240 yen ($2) for a three-minute call to Canada or the United States from Tokyo, compared with the 450 yen ($3) Japanese customers now pay.
The service, which will at first be offered only to business customers in Tokyo, could be used for sending data and faxes, Legere said.

4522,"Anne Bingaman, former chief of the Justice Department's antitrust division, has been named president of LCI International Inc.'s local telecommunications division, the company announced Friday.
Bingaman will also hold the title of corporate senior vice president, the McLean, Va.-based company said in a statement.
She will have an operating role, which will include relationships with all local-exchange carriers and state utility commissions, LCI said.
""They are a very impressive hands-on, go for broke group, and it really matches my own temperament,"" Bingaman said in an interview.
The appointment is not only a coup for LCI, which was not the only phone company seeking Bingaman's talents, but is also unusual in giving a former U.S. official a business operating role as opposed to a non-executive or advisory role.
""That was what attracted me to this, a chance to...roll up my sleeves and get down to it,"" Bingaman said.
She did not expect that her inexperience in business would be a disadvantage because of the time she spent learning the complexities of the telephone business.
""Put it this way, I know a lot more about this business than any other business,"" she said.
Bingaman, 53, headed the antitrust division from 1993 to 1996, holding the title of assistant attorney general. In her first year at the department, she opened more than 70 civil investigations.
She challenged more than 60 mergers, most of which prompted the partners to restructure their deals. Among more noteworthy cases, she negotiated an antitrust settlement with Microsoft Corp. announced in 1994 and opposed Microsoft's failed acquisition of personal finance software maker Intuit Inc.
LCI has received permission in 17 states and the District of Columbia to offer local telephone service on a resale basis, and the company has applications pending for approval in at least 11 other states, it said.
LCI is also negotiating with most of the regional Bell companies and major independent telephone companies for interconnection and local service resale, the company said.
Bingaman said as with 60 percent of LCI's employees, her package would include a stake in the company.

4523,"GTE Corp on Wednesday said it had 800,000 long distance customers at the end of 1996, six percent above the target of 750,000 it set itself after it entering the $80 billion long distance market last March.
GTE gave the new figures in a press release announcing a new flat rate long distance calling plan. It said by the end of this quarter it may up customer targets for 1997, and pull forward the unit's expected break-even target.
""We are evaluating that on a daily basis,"" Rob McCoy, president of GTE long distance, told Reuters in an interview.  
McCoy did not give the current target for end-1997 customers. The unit is currently expected to break-even by the last quarter of 1998 with a full year profit contribution to the parent company for 1999.
GTE is targeting customers who would spend an average $25 a month on long distance. McCoy said bills were at present above $17 reaching towards $20, adding they would rise further as more users emerged from the first few weeks of promotional service.
""We have had some terrific success in our first 10 months,"" McCoy said.  
GTE is approaching the ferociously competitive market cautiously, picking at customers in niches who may switch to the company and stay. Switching and not staying -- called churn in industry jargon -- has been the bane of the industry.
The new ""GTE's Easy One Rate"" plan is aimed at users who want simplicity, and those who make a lot of daytime long distance calls. Several providers offer cheaper off-peak rates than GTE's $0.14 per minute.
""We don't have a mass market strategy,"" McCoy said. GTE is only initially offering the calling plan in 27 states where it already offers local or wireless services.  
The idea is to build a customer base which uses a bundle of services and -- according to business models and market research -- will be less likely to switch carrier than those who only take one service.
GTE has set up a rate plan customer line, 1-800-GTE-3737, and will monitor which areas among the other 23 states where it offers long distance have high demand. This will help it determine where to expand the rate plan, McCoy said.  
GTE's next market niches to attack will include markets for ethnic minorities. This may bundle international calling to the country of origin with multilingual customer service and other services needed in that community marketplace.
""It will be coupled with marketing best able to reach those marketplaces,"" he said.
McCoy said that GTE's long distance unit would shortly be announcing a business data network resale deal with one of the big three long distance carriers, AT&amp;T Corp, MCI Communications Corp or Sprint Corp.
He declined to say which.
GTE resells the network of WorldCom Inc for its basic long distance, so its increased customer tally will also benefit that carrier as the number of network minutes bought rises.

4530,"Ameritech Corp is confident that it has a three-part strategy to keep its earnings growth intact even when new competitors enter its midwest region in force later this year in search of new customers.
The Chicago-based regional Bell has strengthened its core local calling business, moved to enter new businesses like cable TV and security which add value to the network, and sought out profitable niches abroad.
""The beauty is we started these strategies three years ago and they work,"" said Chief Executive Richard Notebaert.
Over lunch in a Manhattan restaurant, Notebaert told Reuters that the costs of fighting new competitors would be significant, but would not seriously hinder growth.
""Will it affect us? Yes. Will it takes us below double digit earnings growth? I don't think so,"" he said.
While some Bells have sought safety and market strength in mergers, Notebaert said Ameritech had not so far found any business combinations that met the acid test.
""We haven't seen anything that would add value for shareholders,"" he said, declining to give details.
Ameritech has taken an individual path in its core business by pushing software calling features like call-waiting and caller ID -- which are very profitable -- instead of extra lines which may not be so profitable.
""We just stopped stimulating it (demand)"" he said, adding that growth in lines had fallen to 3.5 percent a year from 4.5 percent when new lines were actively marketed.
New lines have a very long payback when cable reinforcement is needed in the street, Notebaert said. The additional revenue may be small, especially if the line is used solely for a facsimile machine or Internet usage.
Ameritech also struck out alone in its foray into the security business, which concentrates on remote monitoring of premises. The company bought SecurityLink in 1994 and National Guardian in 1995 and now has 367,000 users, mostly businesses of which 78 percent are outside its home region.
""We are number two in the U.S. and we need to be number one,"" Notebaert said.
Ameritech, which is licensed to offer long distance services in 42 states, has considered using its security  customer base as a launching pad to sell other telecom services outside its region, Notebaert said.
Ameritech has quietly become a force in cable TV, offering service in 20 of 32 franchises it owns in its local region.
The programming is supplied by Americast, which Ameritech owns with BellSouth Corp, SBC Communications, Walt Disney Co, GTE Corp and Southern New England Telecommunications Corp.
Ameritech is shy about revealing cable TV customer numbers. It would only say they number tens of thousands. Of customers approached, 25 percent have taken the service.
The offering is typical of Ameritech's down to earth approach. Notebaert has shied away from futuristic services when it is not clear what the market will support.
""Everyone who went into interactive and multimedia lost their shirts,"" Notebaert said.
Ameritech powered 30 percent of its earnings growth in the fourth quarter of 1996 came from overseas investments, which includes stakes in companies in New Zealand, Hungary, Belgium, Norway and Germany.
""We could have done much more, but we didn't want to take our eye off the ball at home,"" Notebaert said. ((-- New York Newsrom 212 859 1610))1

4531,"Gail McGovern, AT&amp;T Corp.'s new executive vice president for the consumer and small business division, is new to the big challenge facing her: boosting AT&amp;T's share in the consumer long-distance market.
Like her boss, Chief Operating Officer John Walter, McGovern has made a reputation in a different area but will bring a fresh approach, analysts said Monday.
""Gail is very experienced, but her experience is on the business side, and AT&amp;T is facing the bigger challenges on the consumer side,"" said Richard Klugman of brokerage PaineWebber.
McGovern, 44, was named to succeed Joseph Nacchio, who is leaving AT&amp;T to join Qwest Communications Corp., a small telecommunications company in Denver, as chief executive.
She said in an interview Monday that her top priority would be to improve revenue growth and to retain customers.
""I can tell you that focusing on reducing churn will be a top priority in 1997,"" she said in an interview.
As the most senior woman AT&amp;T has ever employed, McGovern will be responsible for more than half the company's revenues.
She expects to apply the same packaging of services to suit consumer customers that she has done in the business market. A single bill for a variety of services will help show the simplicity of offerings, she said.
""Billing is an essential ingredient,"" McGovern said.
AT&amp;T, based in Basking Ridge, N.J., has seen its market share in the $80-billion-a-year long-distance market dwindle from a near-monopoly when a federal judge ordered its divestiture in 1984 to around 55 percent today, according to analysts' estimates.
Apart from MCI Communications Corp. and Sprint Corp., AT&amp;T has recently faced competition from a host of small yet aggressive long-distance companies like LCI International Inc. and Excel Communications Inc..
AT&amp;T has been able to attract consumer customers, at a cost, but has had trouble retaining them.
Analysts who have met her had little doubt McGovern would be up to the task, after winning back major corporate contracts, including IBM Corp., McGraw-Hill Cos. Inc. and Textron Inc..
""She's very bright and very quick,"" said Richard Toole of brokers Merrill Lynch and Co. She has fewer rough edges than Nacchio. Joe was unique, and streetwise, but could be a little brutal,"" he said.
Walter, who was appointed as chief operating officer in October, takes over from Robert Allen as chief executive in May at AT&amp;T's shareholders meeting. McGovern's appointment was his first visible mark on AT&amp;T.
""I see his hands on this promotion, though she was a star to begin with,"" Toole said.
In the interview, McGovern said tying in satellite TV services and other forms of marketing was a great way of reaching new markets.
AT&amp;T has a stake in Hughes Electronic Corp.'s DirecTV direct broadcast satellite venture, and in November set a deal with Shaklee Corp. under which their 500 sales representatives will talk to potential customers about AT&amp;T services.
""We have to explore as many indirect sales channels as possible,"" McGovern said.

4532,"LCI International Inc said on Friday it expected to post a 75 to 80 percent increase in operating earnings in 1996 and a 65 percent increase in revenue.
Brian Thompson, chief executive of the long-distance company, said he never told analysts to expect lower growth from the company. He said he was standing by his long-term forecast of 30 to 40 percent annual revenue growth.
""I told them I never changed that (forecast),"" Thompson told Reuters in a telephone interview. He said he expected the company to put in a strong performance in 1997, too.  
LCI's stock plunged in December after conversations with analysts were interpreted as indicating slower revenue growth. Thompson said he was unable initially to correct the impression because the company was in a quiet period.
""I didn't say we were going to drop in the future. As it turns out, the company will do very well this year (just finished),"" he said.
""I think we will end up around 65 percent (in revenues) for the year. Operating earnings are going to be up even more than that -- they are going to be closer to 75 or 80 percent,"" Thompson said.

4533,"Two major Wall Street brokerages lowered their earnings estimates for AT&amp;T Corp. Monday amid growing competition in the industry, sparking a heavy sell-off of the stock.
The stock slid $2 to $39.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was the second most-active issue. MCI Communications Corp. lost 75 cents to $33.125 on Nasdaq and Sprint Corp. also lost 75 cents to $39.25 on the NYSE in sympathy.
""It is in AT&amp;T's court,"" said analyst Barry Sine of SBC Warburg. ""The more they spend on marketing their new services for the long term, the lower 1997's results will be.""
The market was spooked by Salomon Brothers analyst Jack Grubman, who cited higher spending and greater competition in the telecommunications market. He cut his estimate of AT&amp;T's 1997 earnings to $3.00 per share from $3.60 and his 1998 estimate to $3.25 per share from $3.80.
Fourth-quarter 1996 earnings per share will be closer to 70 cents than the previously forecast of 78 cents, he added.
Grubman said his new estimates may ""still be too high,"" but he continued to recommend holding AT&amp;T stock.
AT&amp;T reported third-quarter profits of $1.4 billion, or 89 cents a share, on revenues of $13.2 billion.
First Boston Corp. also lowered its AT&amp;T earnings estimates, but agreed with most analysts that Salomon's view was too bearish.
""Salomon's number is for a dire outcome,"" said Frank Governali of First Boston, who expects AT&amp;T to earn $3.25 to $3.45 a share for 1997.
""I would be shocked if AT&amp;T diluted its 1997 earnings down to $3.00 per share,"" said Richard Klugman of PaineWebber.
AT&amp;T said it does not comment on stock activity or analysts' reports.
""We have not yet determined what 1997 will bring, but it is safe to say we do not agree with the more pessimistic comments,"" said a source at AT&amp;T who declined to be identified.
The source acknowledged the company was facing stiff competition from traditional rivals like MCI, as well as small aggressive competitors and soon, the regional Bells.
Governali said AT&amp;T had a choice to make: ""Either to run the business for 1997, in which case they could make $3.60 per share, or to position itself for the long-term, in which case there is no way they can"" earn that amount.
Analysts say the whole industry faces the same dilemma.
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 will release the regional Bells into the long distance market place this year, on top of a horde of tiny rivals that have been nibbling away at the customers of the big three.
Though AT&amp;T, MCI and Sprint can enter the local phone market, they will have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to advertise their services, push their brand names and build network facilities to key business customers.
Grubman's research note said he believed AT&amp;T was losing hundreds of millions of dollars on its popular Worldnet Internet access service too, because of high costs.
Analysts said MCI and Sprint have already bitten the bullet by warning analysts of increased spending, but AT&amp;T had not done so.
""Sprint and MCI have already done it. MCI's merger with British Telecommunications Plc is a tacit admission of that fact (that you need very deep pockets to succeed),"" Governali said.
SBC Warburg's Sine said MCI told analysts it would spend an extra $200 million to $300 million this year on marketing, but the stock was not hit because it is supported by the value of the planned British Telecom merger, announced in November.
Separately, AT&amp;T said it won a $341 million contract from Delta Air Lines Inc. for worldwide voice and data services.
The seven-year contract extends an existing agreement between the two under which AT&amp;T provides a virtual network for the airline. The new contract will provide Delta with intelligent call-processing to reduce reservation backlogs.
In another announcement, a partner in an African consortium that is bidding to take over Ivory Coast's Ci-Telcom telephone company said AT&amp;T agreed to buy a 35 percent stake in the consortium, Africa Bell.
Ci-Telcom, with an estimated value of between $200 million to $350 million, is the most important company on Ivory Coast's privatisation programme.
AT&amp;T's involvement, if the Africa Bell bid succeeds, would represent a major breakthrough for an American company in a traditionally French domain. Ivory Coast is the most important economy in France's former colonies in West and Central Africa.

4539,"Fourth quarter results from Sprint Corp showed extremely strong growth in the core long distance and local phone businesses, but earnings trailed consensus estimates because of dilution from new ventures.
""I was pretty pleased. It continues to show strong core growth offset by increased dilution from new ventures,"" said Simon Flannery, an analyst at J.P. Morgan.
Sprint's volume of business in long distance jumped 20 percent in the fourth quarter from a year ago, and operating margins improved.  
Local calling was less outstanding, analysts said, but included a 5.6 percent increase in lines to customers and a 40 percent increase in revenues for smart phone features like Caller ID and voice dialling.
""The core business was an absolute blow-out,"" said Michael Elling of Prudential Securities.
The stock rose 1/2 to 40-3/4 by midsession.
""Investors continue to focus on the strong core growth and the prospects of the emerging businesses,"" said Flannery.  
Sprint is now gearing up to add thousands of PCS and Internet subscribers in 1997, when its vision of a package of services on one bill should reach fruition.
Sprint produced $0.57 earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 1996, compared with a loss of $0.98 a year ago. Analysts added  back an $0.08 charge for comparison with their projections, reaching $0.65 in the quarter.
That was four cents below their consensus of $0.69 carried on First Call, which already assumed considerable dilution from new ventures like Personal Communications Services (PCS) wireless and Global One.  
""That four cents could be placed at the feet of one product, the Internet roll-out,"" said Elling.
Global One, an international venture jointly owned with Deutsche Telekom AG and France Telecom, cost Sprint $0.05 a share in 1996's fourth quarter up from $0.02 a year ago, but costs should decline from now on, analysts said.
""The true-up at Global One seemed to be worth about two cents per share,"" Flannery said, referring to a fourth quarter catch up to costs incurred earlier.  
Sources close to Global One last week told Reuters that the venture had racked up almost $370 million of losses in 1996 instead of $250 million budgeted. Neither Sprint nor Global One would confirm these figures.
The venture serves multinational firms telecom needs and carries traffic for other telecom firms.
The cost of all the new ventures was around 20 cents to Sprint in the fourth quarter, according to Richard Klugman, an analyst at PaineWebber.  
""You will not see the return on these (investments) until 1999 at the earliest,"" said Klugman. However, like other analysts polled he backed the company's strategy. ((-- New York Newsrom 212 859 1610))

4544,"Citizens Utilities Co. said on Thursday it is aiming to be among the largest eight or 10 U.S. telephone companies by the year 2000 by buying up companies in small but important local telephone markets across the country.
""We are looking at acquisitions of this type every day,"" Ronald Spears, vice president for Citizens' telecom business, told Reuters.
Citizens, currently the 15th-largest U.S. phone company, is looking for new properties on both the western and eastern seaboards, particularly in the South and Southwest, where people are already concentrated or are expected to move.
The Stamford, Conn.-based company is a big stakeholder in wireless telephone firm Centennial Cellular Corp. and owns Electric Lightwave Inc., which provides telecommunications services in five western cities.
To facilitate the growth it needs, Citizens is seeking regulatory changes in the markets where it is the incumbent local phone company, hoping to encourage competitors to come in.
""We want to bring the benefits of a competitive market to customers in the second and third tier markets ..."" he said.
Citizens was to file with New York state regulators Thursday to request price cap regulation for the 250,000 customers it has in upstate New York instead of a cap on its rate of return.
Citizens acquired the business in this area from GTE Corp. in 1993.
If approved, Citizens will also change its New York rate structure, merging local calling areas and making wholesale rates on its network more attractive for new market entrants in a plan it has dubbed ""Customer Wins"".
At the moment it is regulated with a cap on its rate of return, which discourages efficiencies because savings have to be shared with customers.
Price caps instead allow companies to keep their cost savings so long as they meet price targets.
While most regional Bells are being accused of dragging their feet over competition, why would Citizens want to encourage rivals to snare its customers?
The difference, Spears says, is in the type of markets. ""The introduction of competition should stimulate demand in these markets, which is historically what happens,"" he said.
Spears said Citizens would get 85 percent of the revenues as a wholesaler, compared with 100 percent as a retailer -- but the market would be larger and grow more quickly.
Already about 20 companies, mainly cellular telephone providers, are lining up to talk to Citizens about interconnection and resale agreements.
The process is being played out in other parts of the country. Citizens has already moved to price cap regulation in California, Tennessee and West Virginia, and plans to do so in the remaining eight states where it operates as soon as possible.
Citizens Utilities' revenues in the first half of 1996 were up 25 percent at $647 million, with telecommunications the main engine of growth.
This year telecom will account for 65 percent of revenue, and in 1997 near 70 percent, with electricity, natural gas and waste water services taking the rest. Telecom operating margins are a healthy 30-33 percent of revenues.
""We're taking a very aggressive posture for what has been recognised historically as a small independent telephone company,"" Spears said.

4548,"At the end of this month, AT&amp;T Corp. will finally untether Lucent Technologies Inc. as a separate company, a year after the telecommunications behemoth first said it would split into three businesses.
For some of AT&amp;T's 3.3 million shareholders -- it has more than any other U.S. corporation -- it may be a confusing time.
Telecom equipment maker Lucent already had an initial public offering of stock in April, but on Sept. 17 AT&amp;T stock will be shorn of the rights to the remaining 82.4 percent of Lucent shares.
AT&amp;T will then made up only of the telecommunications services and computing businesses. The last part of the three way split-up will be around the end of 1996, when shareholders receive stock in computing company NCR.
Existing shareholders on Sept. 30 will receive one new Lucent share for about every three AT&amp;T shares they hold, and if they intend to hold both stocks, they need do nothing.
But the confusion arises because of the necessity to create two new classes of stock -- one for the rump portion of AT&amp;T and one for Lucent -- in the weeks leading up to the  Sept. 30 split.
The New York Stock Exchange said that these classes of temporary ""when issued"" stock -- which are rights to the respective new shares -- will effectively form a market in the new companies before formal trading begins.
""AT&amp;T has done a pretty good job of keeping people informed. But inevitably there will be some confusion,"" said Michael Macleod, a vice president and partner at Shareholders Communications Corp., which specializes in shareholder issues and odd-lot stock programs.
For example, someone selling 100 AT&amp;T shares between Sept. 17 and 30 will in effect be selling rights to 100 new AT&amp;T shares, and rights to just over 30 Lucent shares, although the total proceeds will be the same.
Buyers in that period will be able roughly to reconstruct the old AT&amp;T by buying rights in the same 100 to 30 proportion, or they can buy AT&amp;T or Lucent rights as they see fit. Sellers also can dispose of rights to just one stock and keep the other during that period.
No date has yet been set for the creation of the ""when issued"" stock. AT&amp;T ""when issued"" will be allocated the trading symbol T wd.N, a NYSE spokesman said.
It will not entitle you to any Lucent shares, nor to AT&amp;T's regular 33-cent quarterly dividend, even if it is possible to buy it before the AT&amp;T dividend record date of Sept. 12. On Sept. 30, the AT&amp;T stock symbol will revert to T.N.
The ""when issued"" stock in Lucent (LU wi.N) will carry no rights to Lucent's dividend of 7-1/2 cents a share even if it starts trading before the record date of Sept. 12. At Sept. 30 it will revert to the stock symbol LU.N.
The worst confusion will come for those people who still own stock from the pre-1984 split-up of the Bell system.
""A majority of shareholders -- though representing a small minority of the overall stock held -- still have the original pre-1984 AT&amp;T stock which includes rights to regional Bells,"" said AT&amp;T spokeswoman Eileen Connolly.
If these shareholders want to sell, working out the stock rights and especially the costs for capital gains taxes, could be very complex.
AT&amp;T's 24-hour shareholder information line is 1-800-756-8500.

4550,"The stock of VLSI Technology Inc. took a nose-dive Friday, losing over 25 percent of its value, after projecting that revenues in the 1997 first quarter would be equal to or below the fourth quarter of 1996.
VLSI stock fell $5.875 to close at $17.325 on Nasdaq Friday. More than 19 million shares changed hands, topping the Nasdaq actives list.
The San Jose, Calif.-based high technology company late Thursday reported a loss for the fourth quarter of 1996 of $63.6 million, or $1.38 a share, on revenues of $183.6 million, including a pre-announced charge for closing a factory.
After speaking with analysts, VLSI's vice president of corporate communications Allen Marcow said, ""We did not see a lot of first quarter growth in revenues"" compared with revenues the 1996 fourth quarter.
In the 1996 first quarter, the quarter that will be used for comparison when 1997 figures are released, VLSI earned $3.2 million, or 7 cents a share, on revenues of $167.7 million.
VLSI appears to be facing competition or other problems in three of its four business groups, said C.B. Lee, an analyst at Hancock Institutional Equity Services.
Problem areas are computing, hurt by the recent sales slowdown at a key customer Apple Computer Inc.; digital entertainment where it faces stiff competition from SGS-Thomson, and the Compass software unit.
The key exception is VLSI's wireless communications chip business, which remains strong, Lee said.
Merrill Lynch analyst Tom Kurlak said the stock decline was also a delayed reaction to the Wednesday resignation of VLSI Chief Financial Officer Gregrory Hinckley.
Hinckley left to join Mentor Graphics Corp. as finance chief and chief operating officer. He was replaced at VSLI by Bala Iyer, the company's former controller.
The San Jose, Calif.-based company is a maker of high-end Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) used in communications, digital entertainment and, to a declining extent, in personal computers.
For several years, the company has been undergoing a transition out of the computer chipset business and into more profitable areas such as communications and TV set-top boxes.

4554,"Computer network company 3Com Corp. will acquire modem giant U.S. Robotics in a deal valued at $6.6 billion, the companies said Wednesday, in a deal that would create a counterweight to industry powerhouse Cisco Systems Inc.
The merger -- the largest ever in the computer network industry -- will create a company with more than $5 billion in annual revenues and more than 12,000 employees in 130 countries, U.S. Robotics and 3Com said.
Under terms of the deal announced after markets closed, each share of U.S. Robotics will be swapped for 1.75 shares of 3Com. The deal is valued at $6.6 billion based on the $39.125 Tuesday closing price of 3Com stock, the companies said.
3Com closed Wednesday down 12.5 cents at $39 and U.S. Robotics was down 50 cents at $61, both on Nasdaq.
The companies said the merger would create a company that would provide end-to-end equipment for computer networks.
U.S. Robotics, based in Skokie, Ill., is the world's largest maker of consumer modems, which enable personal computer users to connect to the Internet and online services and to send and receive faxes from their PCs. Santa Clara, Calif.-based 3Com is one of the biggest computer networking companies.
Industry analysts were divided over whether the merger of two of the top six network equipment suppliers would be enough to offer one-stop shopping for network equipment on the scale of No. 1 company Cisco Systems Inc.
""No more 'Cisco and the Seven Dwarfs',"" Bear, Stearns analyst Eric Blachno said, invoking a nickname frequently heard in the industry to describe Cisco's dominant position. ""It appears the Cisco has acquired a large competitor.""
Veteran industy analyst Frank Dzubeck, however, questioned the viability of combining the two companies in light of precedents set by previous mega-mergers in the industry.
""This could be another Bay-Wellfleet-Synoptics deal,"" he said, referring to the 1994 merger that formed Bay Networks Inc. That merger ran into problems over conflicts in combining product lines, company cultures and management teams, analysts have said.
The U.S. Robotics-3Com deal calls for 3Com Chairman Eric Benhamou to remain chairman and chief executive officer of the combined company. U.S. Robotics Chairman and Chief Executive Casey Cowell will join 3Com's board as vice chairman.
""The combination of 3Com and U.S. Robotics dramatically alters the networking landscape with the industry's broadest set of innovative, feature-rich network access solutions,"" said Benhamou. ""Together, with an installed base of over 100 million network connections, we can offer network users the fastest access to their local and wide area networks.
Cowell said, ""By providing faster, more intelligent, and easier-to-use products for connecting the broadest array of users to local and wide area networks, we can accelerate the deployment of networking worldwide.""
Cowell founded the company in 1976 with four college friends, working day and night in a windowless workroom above a military surplus store in Chicago.
U.S. Robotics, known for its Sportster and Courier modems and for being the first to market with 56-kilobit-per-second modem technology, became the darling of Wall Street in its relatively short stint, taking advantage of the Internet craze of the 1990s.
""They've become the bride, one of the most prized catches of networking,"" said Amar Senan, an analyst for investment bankers Volpe, Welty &amp; Co.
""They've come from a humble analogue company to one of the most formidable networking companies,"" Senan said. ""They started with 300 (bits per second) modems"" and just this week shipped their first 56 kilobit ""x2"" modems.
The company's first modems were sold under the names of Apple Computer Inc. and Commodore Computers. In 1987, the company began to focus on selling its own brand of products and posted revenues of $21 million. For fiscal 1996 which ended on Sept. 30, U.S. Robotics reported revenues of $1.98 billion.
U.S. Robotics went public in October of 1991 at $13 a share. After stock splits, a $1,000 investment made in 1991 is worth about $30,000, Cowell said.

4555,"3Com Corp Chairman Eric Benhamou said he plans to use the company's proposed merger with U.S. Robotics Corp to expand the reach of 3Com's office-oriented equipment into small business and home markets.
In a telephone interview Wednesday evening after the announcement of the $7.3-billion-merger (on a fully-diluted basis), Benhamou said a key force behind the deal was the prospect of enlarging the market for its corporate network equipment into retail sales channels.
As the leading supplier of modems, U.S. Robotics' strong presence in retail outlets can be used to propel sales of 3Com's core network adapter card business, he said.
3Com is by far the world's dominant supplier of adapters, or network interface cards (NICs), used to link personal computers to networks.
""Our OfficeConnect product line is perfect for the retail market,"" Benhamou said, referring to products it introduced in 1996 that repackage its other corporate office equipment -- hubs, switches and routers -- for small business and home users.
OfficeConnect products link the computers, printers, modems and telephones found in home offices in a low-cost network.  
Benhamou also sees opportunities to sell U.S. Robotics modem products for desktop and laptop computers to corporate offices using 3Com's 500-strong enterprise sales force.
""We will just leverage Robotics strength in retail outlets,"" he said in reference to his plan to shoe horn 3Com equipment into consumer markets that -- until the recent demand explosion for Internet links -- was largely confined to office networks.
""(The new demand for network connections) even reaches into your shirt pocket with products like Pilot,"" he said. Pilot, a product 3Com will acquire in the merger, is a shirt-pocket sized personal information organizer that offers ties to the Internet.
Further growth will come from Robotics efforts to develop higher speed modems like the 56 kilobit ones it introduced on Monday and future cable modem and digital subscriber line modems that transit up to six megabits per second.
He said the merger would also give 3Com access to a growing base of telco carrier customers who use Robotics hubs equipment to provide Internet dial-up services, saving 3Com from having to invest on its own to enter the Wide Area Network (WAN) market.  
Robotics focuses heavily on WANs, providing equipment for both ends of an Internet connection: modems for consumers and hub connections for service providers. Fifty percent of its revenue come from modems, a third from hub equipment and about 20 percent from sales of Pilot and miscellaneous products.
""As far as technology is concerned, we are very focused on LANs,"" Benhamou said, contrasting his company's traditional focus on local area networks (LAN) found in corporate offices.
Of 3Com's $2.3 billion in fiscal 1996 revenues, 40 percent came from network adapter cards and 60 percent from sales of hubs, switches and routers systems, largely to corporations.
""We only have about one to two percent overlap in terms of product revenues,"" Benhamou said of the two companies.

4573,"3Com Corp and U.S. Robotics Corp's merger promises to create a second powerhouse in the data networking industry capable of competing head-to-head in the Internet access business with Cisco Systems Inc.
The merger, valued at $6.6 billion in stock, represents the largest such deal ever in the computer network industry.
But analysts were divided on whether the merger by two of the top six network equipment suppliers will be strong enough to offer end-to-end network connections on the scale of Cisco.  
""No more Cisco and the Seven Dwarfs,"" Bear Stearns analyst Eric Blachno said, invoking an analogy frequently heard in the industry to describe Cisco's dominant market leadership.
""It appears the Cisco has acquired a large competitor,"" he said in reaction to the latest industry consolidation move.
However, veteran industry analyst Frank Dzubeck questioned the viability of combining the two companies in light of precedents set by previous mega-mergers in the industry.  
""This could be another Bay-Wellfleet-Synoptics deal,"" he said, referring to the 1994 merger that formed Bay Networks Inc, a union seen as running aground over conflicts in integrating product lines, company cultures and managements.
Similarly, Dzubeck, president of Communications Networks Architects Inc, an industry consulting firm, said 3Com and U.S. Robotics represented ""two cultures, two different product streams, two managements.""
""A lot depends on how they meet the organizational challenges,"" the analyst said of the complexities inherent in combining companies centered about 2,000 miles apart.  
3Com is headquartered in Santa Clara, Calif., the heart of Silicon Valley, while U.S. Robotics is located in Skokie, Ill.
3Com is known as the leading maker of network adapter cards used to connect personal computers to office networks. Roughly 40 percent of its $2.3 billion in fiscal 1996 revenues were derived from adapter card sales, analysts say.
By contrast, Robotics is the top maker of computer modems for consumers and other products providing Internet access.
The $1.9 billion company also sells switchboard-like data communications hubs, which Internet Service Providers (ISPs) use to handle scores of simultaneous incoming consumer calls.  
""The whole concept of those two companies getting together is a very strong one,"" said Paul Deninger, chief executive of Broadview Associates, a high-technology investment banking firm, when asked Tuesday to speculate on rumors of the merger.
""Robotics is a remote access company,"" Deninger said. ""3Com has no remote access strategy. This provides them one.""
While Deninger is an active dealmaker in the networking industry -- completing 24 smaller technology acquisition deals in the last 18 months -- the latest merger was managed by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, according to the companies.  
In a conference call, executives of the two companies said 3Com's strength as a corporate equipment supplier and U.S. Robotics' strong retail presence would allow the company to compete in both local-area and wide-area networks.
But several industry analaysts said rather than allowing 3Com to compete head-to-head in every market segment of the networking industry, the merger was best seen as allowing it to create a defensible niche in important segments.  
3Com Chairman and Chief Executive Eric Benhamou acknowledged as much in saying his company's strengths lie at what he called ""the edge of the network"" -- selling products to connect office workers and consumers to computer networks.
""We are much stronger at the edge of the network,"" Benhamou said, allowing that archrival Cisco dominates the core of office networks and long-distance ""backbone"" networks.
Cisco's strength in the larger network equipment used to build these portions of computer networks was bolstered by a major acquisition of its own last April, when it paid about $4 billion to acquire Stratacom Inc.  
The combination of 3Com and Robotics comes no where near Cisco in several vital respects. Their combined revenues are running at roughly $5 billion a year, officials said, compared with Cisco's current annual run rate of more than $6 billion.
But Cisco's daunting advantages become more apparent when the underlying growth rates of the companies are compared.
While the 3Com and Robotics businesses are estimated to be growing at 40 percent per year -- a healthy rate by most any industry measure -- Cisco continues to outrun all major competitors by its explosive 80 percent per year pace.
""That's an amazing growth rate,"" Deninger said of Cisco's market momentum. ""Especially since no one else in the industry is growing faster than 40 percent,"" he said.
Across a variety of measures Cisco remains the dominant player in the industry, followed by a 3Com/Robotics combination, Bay Networks Inc and Cabletron Systems Inc.

4575,"On top of its domestic troubles, AT&amp;T Corp must now contend with new threats to its international strategy after Friday's defection of Spain's Telefonica into the rival British Telecom-MCI camp.
""They certainly have a lot of balls up in the air,"" Bear Stearns telecommunications analyst Bill Deatherage said, referring to the multiple battles facing AT&amp;T, the largest U.S. telephone company.  
The international rebuff comes just ahead of AT&amp;T's first-quarter earnings report, slated for release Monday.
Wall Street expectations are set low after the company's warning to financial analysts in early March that heavy investments in competitive initiatives would cause earnings in 1997 to fall substantially short of profit last year.
Analysts on average expect AT&amp;T to post first-quarter earnings of $0.69 per share, down from $0.90 in the 1996 first quarter.  
Analysts agree AT&amp;T's primary focus must remain on shoring up its domestic results, most of all in its core long-distance business, which is contending with market share losses to large long-distance rivals as well as smaller niche players. At the same time, it must gear up for the emerging competition in local phone and wireless communications services, they said.
Nonetheless, global alliances are forming fast, and AT&amp;T is widely perceived to have been put on the defensive after recent moves by Concert, the British Telecommunications Plc and MCI Communications Corp alliance.  
On Friday, Telefonica de Espana SA said it struck an alliance with MCI and British Telecom, a move that is expected to open up the vast Latin American market for Concert.
Later, AT&amp;T said Telefonica's new relationship was ""incompatible"" with the Spanish company's membership in the Unisource telecom alliance backed by AT&amp;T.
The U.S.-based company said it expected to spend $8 billion to $9 billion this year -- mainly on new high-speed data networks and to expand wireless services -- which would dilute earnings by $0.75 to $1.00 per share.

4587,"Seeking to show its readiness to compete in high-speed networking, Bay Networks Inc on Tuesday unveiled a set of products and strategies aimed at shoring up its reputation as a technology leader and helping it recover from the stumbles of recent years.
David House, Bay's recently hired chairman and chief executive, outlined the company's new ""Adaptive Networking"" strategy for making the plumbing of Internet-based networks easier to upgrade to the higher-speed networks now emerging.  
""Everybody's goal is networks that are invisible to the user,"" House said during a Las Vegas press conference at Networld+Interop, the semiannual trade show of the Internet equipment industry.
""We want networks that behave like electricity and water,"" House said, comparing computer networks to other well-developed infrastructures.
""Adaptive Networks are the products and technologies that will transition us to the Internet-optimized networks of tomorrow,"" he said.  
His appearance came exactly six months after House joined Bay Networks from Intel Corp, where he served as a respected senior executive for more than two decades.
Highlighting the company's new product announcements was a new single, application-specific networking chip capable of carrying up to 1.5 million packets of Internet data a second --- allowing networks to carry billions of bits of data per second.
The company said the new Route Switch Processor (RSP) integrates the manageability of routers with the speed of switches -- two traditionally separate product categories.  
House said the RSP chip, now running in Bay laboratories, would be offered in new routing switch products due out in 1998.
The RSP chip is designed to solve the growing demand for high-speed Internet transmission, while reducing technical bottlenecks that cause congestion on overloaded data networks.
House said RSP would serve as the core technology in its main product lines, including local networks used in corporate offices and in products serving telephone and Internet carriers.  
He said the chip would allow Bay to cut switch product prices tenfold over time, driving the cost of advanced switching down to $500 per connection from $5,000 currently.
Sounding like the old chip revolution evangelist he is, House described what he said were the semiconductor-driven dynamics of the networking business, which is seeing benefits from both exponential jumps in the power of computer chip technology and commodity-style price cuts.

4588,"Shareholders of MCI Communications Corp. are expected to vote overwhelmingly in favour of the proposed merger with British Telecommunications Plc at MCI's annual shareholder meeting Wednesday.
The shareholder vote is one of the first major milestones on the road to winning approval for the $23 billion trans-Atlantic merger, which would create a combined company known as Concert Plc with $40.6 billion in revenues.
The merger awaits regulatory approvals in Washington, London and Brussels, the headquarters of the European Union. Company officials are confident the merger -- announced in November -- is on track to close in the fall of 1997.
The annual meeting, to be held in Wilkes Barre, Pa., two hours north of Philadelphia, is expected to be a quiet affair, with only three items on the agenda -- the shareholder vote, and election of directors and auditors.
Wilkes Barre was chosen because it was the hometown of William McGowan, the legendary founder and former chairman of MCI, who died in June 1992. Washington-based MCI is the nation's second largest long distance company.
In his speech to shareholders Wednesday, Bert Roberts, MCI's current chairman and chief executive, is expected to focus on the projected benefits of its merger, which creates one of the world's first global communications carriers.
One industry analyst briefed by the company said he expected Roberts to reveal some of the early products and services that may result from its ties to British Telecom.
Among the possible offerings would be seamless services connecting the United States and Britain, including wireless phone transmission, faxing, electronic mail, voice mail and the Internet, the analyst said.
Industry analysts believe the MCI official will also respond to AT&amp;T Corp.'s initiative to offer local phone service using a fixed wireless system attached to the side of a customer's premises as a means of bypassing local networks controlled by regional Bell companies.
Through interconnection pacts and the new wireless technology, AT&amp;T has said by 1998 it plans to offer local service to the vast majority of the U.S. population.
MCI made an early move into local phone markets with its MCI Metro unit, but has appeared less aggresive than its peers since the passage of the U.S. Telecommunications Act of 1996 in evolving a strategy to expand its local phone presence.
A key benefit of the merger with cash-rich British Telecom is the financing muscle that MCI can tap as MCI seeks to slice substantial market share away from the incumbent regional Bell telephone companies in various local service markets.
MCI provides local service in 20 U.S. metropolitan markets through a mix of company-owned facilities and resale agreements to use other companies' networks. It has said it plans to be in 31 local service markets by the end of 1997.

4591,"Computer Associates International Inc shares gave up six percent of their value Wednesday and analysts said the fall reflected concern over an unexpected secular decline in mainframe revenues.
While the company had issued cautionary comments in late December that revenues were unlikely to meet expecations due to sales problems in its European operations, analysts said they were caught off guard by the mainframe sales slippage.
By midday Wednesday, the stock had fallen three points to 43.  It was the second most active issue on the NYSE.  
In addition, analysts said CA's decline may be tied to broader weakness in the mainframe business, citing disappointing growth in International Business Machines Corp's own hardware business during the December quarter.
IBM is the world's dominant supplier of mainframe software, while Computer Associates is a leading independent supplier of software used to run mainframe machines.
""People got spooked about the mainframe business,"" said Alex. Brown analyst Chris Mortenson, who noted the company told analysts in a conference call Tuesday night mainframe revenues had fallen eight percent in the December quarter.  
Cowen &amp; Co analyst Drew Brosseau said mainframe sales were a primary reason why he had lowered his revenue estimates for the fiscal fourth quarter ending in March and for its fiscal 1998 year.  He also tied the stock decline back to IBM.
""Anything that affects IBM mainframes positively or negatively is going to have an impact on CA,"" he said, noting how IBM's mainframe growth is considered a key indicator of the health of the mainframe business overall.
The analyst said he trimmmed his March fourth quarter revenue estimate by $40 million to $1.6 billion and reduced fiscal 1998 revenues by $150 million to $4.55 billion.  
But despite mounting mainframe revenue concerns, most analysts left earnings estimates and stock ratings untouched.
""Most of that near-term transitional challenge is in the stock so we are still recommending it,"" Brosseau said. ""But I expect the performance to come mostly in the second half of the (calendar) year."" He stood by his $55 12-month target.
Mortensen added that, ""I find today that most investors are asking, 'What's going to make the stock go up in the next 30 days?' If you don't have a good answer, they sell it.""
The stock has fallen back in recent weeks from the historic high of just under 68 it acheived in early December.  
Although the company said in October that it was planning to focus its business increasingly on client/server instead of mainframe software, and warned in December of a transitional revenue shortfall, analysts said they were suprised to see an absolute decline in mainframe sales during the latest quarter.
In a published note, Furman Selz analyst Sanjiv Hingorani said mainframe revenues fell eight percent to $640 million, mostly in Europe.  He said CA had suggested the shortfall in the region amounted to $200 million in unrealized revenues.
Especially troubling to analysts was a sequential decline in mainframe MIPS among existing customers CA had described.  
MIPS, or Millions of Instructions Per Second, is a measure of the capacity of the mainframe systems shipped to customers.
In its own commments to analysts Tuesday evening, IBM said MIPS grew 35 percent in the fourth quarter compared with 80 percent in fourth quarter 1995.  MIPS are the primary indicator of mainframe growth IBM discloses to analysts.
Mortenson said Computer Associates executives said they had never encountered such a decline in mainframe capacity. Under grilling by analysts, they said they believed it to be an anomaly which would disappear in the current quarter.
The company, which has historically derived more than 70 percent of its revenues from mainframe sales, said mainframe software accounted for 61 percent of revenues in the December quarter, while client/server software amounted to 39 percent.
Computer Associates reported operating earnings of $0.75 per share for its fiscal third quarter ended in December versus $0.60 per share in the December 1995 quarter. The latest quarter excluded a $598 million acquisition charge.

4600,"News that Colombia's largest truck drivers' association is preparing its second nationwide stoppage in five months has set alarm bells ringing among private coffee exporters.
The Colombian Truckers' Association (ACC), which comprises 5,000 owner-operators and at least 180,000 drivers -- an estimated 80 percent of all truck drivers in the country -- will set the start date for the strike at a meeting on March 22, one of the organization's senior officials told Reuters this week.
One private exporter said he feared the action could delay 250,000 60-kg bags of coffee scheduled for April shipment if the stoppage begins as predicted after Easter week.
Another described the strike threat as ""very serious"" and said it may also delay the tail end of March exports if these are held up by the Easter bank holiday.
A fax sent to ACC members this week stated: ""In the meeting of the association's national directorate to be held March 22 we will definitely be setting the zero hour for the start of a new stoppage by all our members and affiliates at national level with the aim of demanding the fulfillment (of the earlier accord).""
National directorate member Mario Quiroga told Reuters that initial plans were to begin the strike before Easter. He said, however, that realistically it would probably start later but was unable to give an exact date.
The ACC staged a crippling 11-day strike last October which paralyzed virtually all road freight across the country and delayed the shipment of at least 250,000 60-kg bags of key coffee exports, according to a statement by the National Coffee Growers' Federation at the time.
One private exporter predicted the impact of a new stoppage would be similar.
""If this strike starts in the last week of March I believe it could delay 200,000 bags and if it doesn't begin until April then we would be talking about 250,000 bags of export commitments in the first two weeks,"" the exporter, who did not wish to be named, said.
The truckers have renewed their strike call, arguing that transport companies and cargo owners have not fulfilled the 19-point deal which was hammered out to end the October stoppage.
The accord, underwritten by the government, included an agreement for an immediate 16 percent hike in freight rates with a further 14 percent rise at the start of this year. It also included provisions for cuts in the cost of highway tolls, operating licenses and other associated taxes as well as a pledge to review maximum load restrictions.
""There has been a lack of seriousness on the part of the government. There has been a total lack of commitment. None of the points have been fulfilled,' said Quiroga.
If there is no 11th-hour deal to avert the stoppage it will be the fourth strike to hit the coffee sector in five months.
In addition to the first truckers' strike in October, industrial action by dock workers in the main Pacific coast port of Buenaventura paralyzed an estimated 300,000 60-kg bags of export coffee for nine days in January and a week-long national strike by public sector workers in February interrupted road freight -- including coffee -- in the first few days.
""It's difficult to put a figure on how much coffee would be delayed by a new truckers' strike but this is very serious. It could delay March and April commitments,"" another private exporter said.
Fabio Trujillo, chairman of the National Coffee Growers' Unit, which represents coffee growers in 100 towns across nine provinces, branded the strike threat ""irresponsible"".
""This is an irresponsible attitude, especially on the part of those who have not fulfilled the previous agreement. Last time this type of strike paralyzed exports and cost the nation such a great amount,"" he said.
""What we really have to do now is to be exporting all we can to take advantage of the high international prices,"" he added.
Trujillo, however, doubted the strike would have an impact on the so-called Mitaca harvest which provides about 40 percent of Colombia's total production. He said the harvest was late and would likely begin toward the end of April.
The National Coffee Growers' Unit has been at the forefront of the fight to win debt relief for coffee growers.
Finance Minister Jose Antonio Ocampo announced Monday that those growers who had contracted less than 5 million pesos debt before December 1994 would be excused. Trujillo welcomed the move but called for a debt moratorium for medium-sized growers with larger debts.

4602,"Horacio Serpa, Colombia's Interior Minister and the strongman of President Ernesto Samper's administration, resigned on Tuesday to prepare his bid for the presidency.
In accepting Serpa's public letter of resignation, Samper wished his right-hand man ""every success in your new activities"" in a laudatory reply made available to the media.
""Long ago, I took the commitment to serve the country in public office and I wish to continue that task ... I present my resignation from my current post,"" Serpa said in his letter to Samper that revealed the pair's close political and personal friendship.
The move comes less than a week before the May 31 deadline by which prospective candidates must step down from public office if they wish to run in the May 1998 elections to choose Samper's successor.
Serpa, 53, a ruling Liberal Party member, has been at the helm of the Interior Ministry since Samper took office in August 1994. An able politician and fiery public speaker, Serpa earned himself a reputation as the president's staunchest ally, defending him against accusations that he financed his 1994 election campaign with drug money from the infamous Cali cartel.
Samper was cleared of wrongdoing in a congressional inquiry last year. But Serpa, one of the campaign organisers, is still under investigation on suspicion of knowingly accepting illicit donations.
""These years have been a great and difficult experience. There has never been so much controversy or such acute confrontations,"" Serpa said in his letter, in reference to the drug-funding scandal that has dogged most of Samper's rule.
In addition to rounding on Samper's opponents at home, Serpa launched outspoken attacks against the president's fiercest international critic -- the United States.
He recently dubbed U.S. Ambassador Myles Frechette, a ""sick gringo"" for what he claimed was the envoy's constant meddling in Colombia's internal affairs, especially those relating to anti-drug policy.
In the letter accepting his minister's resignation, Samper wrote: ""In these times devoid of values and ideals, your brave attitudes against violence, corruption ... or in defence of sovereignty are refreshing examples of a clean career.""
Recent opinions polls show Serpa lagging behind the former Chief Prosecutor turned presidential candidate Alfonso Valdivieso, a thorn in the side of Samper's administration for his pursuit of political corruption.
But Valdivieso, also a Liberal, shunned his party's backing and announced that he would run as an independent. Serpa, meanwhile, is likely to be able to count on the full political and financial support of the well-greased party machinery, which political analysts believe will greatly strengthen his hand as the presidential campaign gets into full swing.

4610,"BOGOTA, April 23 Reuter - Colombia will draw heavily on its coffee stockpiles to meet export commitments, given that the 1996/97 harvest seems set to come in lower than previous estimates of 10.4 million 60-kg bags, the country's coffee czar Jorge Cardenas said this week.
Many private exporters and independent analysts, however, believe that much of the powerful National Coffee Growers' Federation's stocks are old crop or even beans that have been damaged by the so-called ""broca"" or berry borer - thereby making much of it unfit for export.
Gloomy harvest predictions by federation head Cardenas coincided with a report in Colombia's leading political magazine Semana that said serious underlying structural problems were the prime cause behind falling production levels.
In an impromptu press conference after the weekly federation meeting Monday, Cardenas said the 1996/97 harvest would come in at little over 10 million 60-kg bags. He predicted coffee inventories would drop to 3.5 million bags from current levels of about five million bags by the end of September this year as Colombia sought to meet export schedules.
He declined to comment on independent sources' claims that much of the stocks were old.
Quoting a range of experts, Semana magazine said the gradual fall in coffee output was due to the progressive aging of coffee plantations or because growers were abandoning them altogether.
A separate report in the respected El Espectador daily newspaper cited National Statistics Department figures saying that the dismal 0.21 percent growth rate of the agricultural sector in 1996 was largely due to the poor performance of coffee, with an 18.5 percent drop in production.
Also at Monday's federation meeting, the organization's technical director Antonio Herron, warned that ""broca"" was continuing to spread and could affect all Colombia's 900,000 hectares of coffee by 1999. At present about 680,000 hectares are affected by broca, about 75 percent of the country's plantations.
Federation officials previously said growers were managing to keep broca in check thanks to a vigorous TV advertising campaign. Growers themselves complain that the fight against broca has pushed up production costs.
The federation estimates that about five percent of the 1996/97 coffee crop will be damaged by broca -- a little more than 500,000 60-kg sacks -- further forcing down the amount of excelso coffee available for export.
The prevailing gloom was partially lifted by predictions by U.S. brokerage Merrill Lynch that international coffee prices could stay high until September.
Cardenas predicted July-September coffee prices would rise to somewhere around current spot May levels because of continuing supply jitters in the international markets.
A second bright point came at the end of last week with the negotiated end to a five-day truck drivers' strike, which Cardenas said had done ""a lot of damage to coffee flows"" and delayed shipment of 200,000 70-kg bags.

4614,"A nationwide public workers' strike entered its second day in Colombia Wednesday, but it was soccer that brought the nation to a standstill.
Thousands of workers deserted picket lines to watch television coverage of a World Cup eliminator clash between Colombia and arch-rivals Argentina in the Caribbean port city of Barranquilla.
""There were meetings and pickets this morning but most people went home because the strike has more or less come to a halt because of the soccer,"" said Wilson Borja, leader of the public sector FENALTRASE union.
In a country full of soccer fanatics, a match featuring Colombia's undefeated World Cup contenders would understandably get a bigger draw than picket lines. But even the private sector ground to a halt as employees crowded around TV sets to watch the nail-biting match.
But some say the government has purposely used soccer in the past to deflect attention away from perceived or actual political crises.
""It goes back to the Roman times when emperors offered bread and circus to the people. The problem in Colombia is that there is circus but no bread for the masses,"" said Enrique Parejo, a former justice minister.
Few are better placed than Parejo to comment on the link between politics and sport.
He was justice minister, in November 1985, when leftist rebels of the now-defunct M-19 movement stormed the Palace of Justice in downtown Bogota, taking more than 300 hostages and prompting a violent counter-attack by the army.
At the height of the battle the government encouraged radio and TV stations to halt live broadcasts from the scene and transmit a series of soccer matches instead.
""I didn't take part in the decision but I think undoubtedly it was aimed at diverting attention from what was going on,"" Parejo said.
Likewise, on the first day of the nationwide strike by an estimated 800,000 state workers Tuesday -- which government officials predicted could spark widespread violence -- a state-run TV channel re-broadcast Colombia's 1993 5-0 soccer victory over Argentina in Buenos Aires.
""I think they did it deliberately to try and neutralise the strike and get people off the streets,"" Parejo said.
Underscoring the fanaticism surrounding soccer in Colombia, 120 people were murdered across the country in celebrations that followed that thrashing of Argentina four years ago.

4624,"Hundreds more families are continuing to flee violence through the jungles of northwest Colombia, adding to a burgeoning refugee crisis in the town of Mutata, its mayor said on Tuesday.
At least 2,500 people arrived in a village close to Mutata in the violence-torn Uraba region over Easter, and Mayor Luis Renteria said another 1,500 mostly women and children were expected to arrive in the next few days.
In the first international response to the drama, a British embassy official said on Tuesday that Britain's Overseas Development Agency had approved an $80,000 emergency aid package of tents and food supplies, due to be sent to the region before the weekend.
The army has accused Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrillas of ordering the peasants to abandon their homes in the Rio Salaqui basin of neighbouring Choco province in order to create ""social disorder"" in the main towns of Uraba.
But a FARC spokeswoman said the people had fled in the face of ""indiscriminate"" aerial bombardments by the army and threats from right-wing paramilitary groups.
""These people say they will not return home until they have guarantees from the government that paramilitary groups will be forced out of their communities,"" Renteria said.
He said one-third of the refugees in Pavarando, in the municipality of Mutata, were children, and that more than 80 women who spent up to four weeks walking from their homes along treacherous jungle tracks were pregnant.
A British embassy official said tents and food would be purchased locally and channelled to the refugees via the International Committee of the Red Cross.
The human tide of refugees has drawn an angry response from army commander Gen. Manuel Jose Bonett, who said: ""The guerrilla strategy is to force these people to move out and occupy towns to create a huge social problem.""
But a FARC spokeswoman told Reuters: ""We have been in contact with our people in the area and they say there has been intense fighting with the army. Because the army has not been able to wipe out the guerrilla it has staged indiscriminate aerial bombardments of the area.""
Interior Minister Horacio Serpa and provincial governor Alvaro Uribe are scheduled to visit the refugees in Mutata on Wednesday.
Uraba, which covers parts of Choco, Antioquia and Cordoba provinces, is the scene of bitter conflict between the army and the guerrillas. The army says it is a key arms and drug smuggling route for the rebels, while the guerrillas say right-wing forces are trying to force peasants out of the strategically important, resource-rich region close to the border with Panama.
There are an estimated 7,000 internal refugees spread across Uraba and more than 900,000 people have been displaced in the last decade by Colombia's long-running guerrilla war.

4629,"Gloria Cuartas is still haunted by the image of two gunmen who beheaded a child as she watched from the gates of a school in this troubled northwestern town.
The men tossed the severed head toward her as she shepherded young pupils back into the classroom seconds before a rival gang arrived and a shootout erupted. That experience is at the heart of why Cuartas, the mayor of Apartado, is raising a rare voice for peace amid the drums of war that thunder across the killing fields of Uraba -- one of the most violent regions of Colombia.
Since she took office in January 1995 Cuartas has battled to build an oasis of neutrality to shelter the civilian population from the crossfire of a savage war between leftist guerrillas, right-wing paramilitaries and the army.
""I was visiting a school last August when two men grabbed a child behind the school. They punched him in the stomach and then cut his head off and threw it toward me,"" Cuartas told Reuters. ""There was a shootout and I took refuge with the children in the classroom and then in a nearby house.""
She believes the attack was an attempt by paramilitaries to frighten her into quitting her post. But like most crimes in the area, the child's killers were never brought to justice.
CONSENSUS CANDIDATE
The gutsy, pint-sized mayor was elected as the consensus candidate of political forces ranging from the traditional Liberal and Conservative Parties to the left-wing Patriotic Union, seen as the political wing of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the country's largest guerrilla army.
She realised that in the short term it was impossible to take the guns out of local politics in this strategically located region where left and right have killed with impunity for more than a decade. But she has made repeated calls for townspeople to declare ""active neutrality"" and not take sides in the sectarian violence.
""You can't issue a decree about that because there's pain, suffering, refugees, resentment and people buried in shallow graves. But I do know the people of Apartado are tired of suffering,"" Cuartas said.
Apartado, with a population of 80,000, is the regional centre of this banana-growing region, which spreads across the provinces of Antioquia, Choco and Cordoba.
There were three massacres in and around the town last year, contributing to a death toll of more than 350 -- more than four times the national per capita average. Peasants are gunned down on a daily basis as they walk along dirt tracks that wind through lush banana plantations. And last month 11 civilians were killed and 60 others injured when FARC rebels detonated a massive car bomb in the town centre.
LIBERATION THEOLOGY A HELP
Cuartas, 36, a trained social worker, grew up near Medellin, Colombia's third largest city, and was educated by Carmelite nuns. ""I always read a lot about liberation theology -- that has been my guide. I was educated not just to talk of Jesus and justice but to construct it,"" Cuartas explained.
Her work has received wide international recognition and last year she won the United Nations UNESCO Mayors for Peace award. But with less than a year before her mandate ends many at home are sceptical of her project for peace.
""Gloria Cuartas' neutrality is in question. She's more a friend of the guerrillas than of the other political actors,"" said Hernan Correa, one of the leaders of the banana workers' union Sintrainagro.
Townspeople frequently complain about a lack of progress on public works projects and most adopt their own strategy of ""seeing but not looking and hearing but not listening"" to stay on the sidelines of the dirty war raging around them.
Other critics believe Cuartas has gone too far for a supposedly neutral mayor in voicing claims of a secret pact between the army, the banana companies and right-wing death squads. The fact that those views feature on an Internet page (http://www.igc.apc.org/csn/gloria.html/) set up by the Colombia Support Network rights group based in Apartado's sister town of Madison, Wisconsin, has further raised hackles in the military.
""She uses the image of violence to sell her political ideas ... and gives a distorted view of what's going on and gets a page on the Internet. What does she want? She will be a tireless champion of the violations against the Patriotic Union,"" said Col. Mario Correa.
But Cuartas, who shuns police protection and private bodyguards, continues to speak out regardless of the clamour of verbal attacks and a daily diet of death threats.
""I ask you who is killing the people. It's not peasant against peasant, are you blind? The whole world must speak out about this -- there's no room for another single body in this cemetery,"" she said.

4631,"Manuel de Jesus Pena does not want to know who blew his legs off in an indiscriminate grenade attack last year -- he just wants the dirty war to stop.
Like thousands of other civilians in this northwest region of Uraba -- the most violent corner of Colombia -- Pena is caught in the crossfire of a bitter conflict between Marxist rebels, right-wing death squads and the army.
""I don't know if it was the guerrillas, the army or the paramilitaries. The important thing is that I survived and that I carry on living,"" Pena told Reuters as he sat in his one-room home in the regional center of Apartado. ""I would just tell the men of violence to stop this madness because those who are suffering are not directly involved in the war.""
In the last year alone, more than 2,000 people were killed in tit-for-tat political violence across Uraba. At least 350 of those deaths were in Apartado.
Of the dead, 51 were slain by gunmen of the left and right in seven cold-blooded massacres last year, according to figures compiled by Maria Girlesa Villegas, head of the Human Rights Ombudsman's office in Apartado.
Foreigners have not completely escaped the violence. A Russian cyclist was killed last year and a German and an Austrian tourist were kidnapped this year and later killed by guerrillas in the western part of the region.
PARAMILITARIES WAGE SCORCHED EARTH OFFENSIVE
The upsurge in violence in Uraba coincided with the political rise of the leftwing Patriotic Union (UP) party a decade ago, culminating in its victory in mayoral elections in the region's main towns in 1992.
Spawned from a failed government peace process, the UP was seen by detractors on the right as the political wing of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the country's largest rebel army, formed as a pro-Soviet force in 1964.
In a ""fire and blood"" offensive, paramilitaries drove the UP and what they saw as other potential rebel sympathizers from the north and south of Uraba. For the past year they have focused on the central zone, known as the ""banana belt.""
Jose Herman, a UP leader who fled Apartado last October, is convinced the paramilitaries have forged a covert pact with the army and the banana companies to spearhead a scorched earth policy aimed at annihilating leftists in the region.
""There's strong links between the banana companies and the paramilitaries. Their theory was to take the water away from the fish and they began to kill us, calling us guerrilla collaborators,"" he said, adding that although UP and the FARC shared many ideals their command structures were separate.
REBELS IN IDEOLOGICAL ABOUT-FACE
In a confusing ideological about-face, the FARC's former allies, the Maoist-inspired People's Liberation Army (EPL), are now their bitter enemies. Most EPL fighters laid down their arms in 1991 and went on to form the Hope, Peace and Liberty political movement, which now dominates the main banana workers' union Sintrainagro.
But some former EPL rebels joined the ranks of the paramilitary death squads, sparking reprisals by the FARC against all Hope, Peace and Liberty members. ""The abuses were committed by the FARC and now they're paying the price,"" said Hernan Correa, a Sintrainagro leader and former EPL insurgent.
Underlying the bitter sectarian rivalry is the battle for economic control of this strategic region nestled between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans near the border with Panama. The military say it is a key transit route for drugs and arms.
Some local experts believe the only real hope for an end to the killing is for one side or the other to drive its rival out of the area. But for the moment none of the armed actors has the firepower to fight a classic war of positions and hold on to the territory it gains -- not even the army.
""We lack mobility. We need more budget for arms, ammunition and helicopters. We only have three helicopters here. If they just gave me 10 more then I'm sure that within less than six months we would finish this problem,"" regional army commander Gen. Rito Alejo del Rio said.
But no argument will convince one 18-year-old police rookie, who arrived in the town the day before the FARC killed 11 people with a massive car-bomb in February, that this is a war worth fighting and even less one that can be won.
""This is war of the mad, the demented and the psychopaths,"" he said.

4633,"Colombia's main truck drivers' union has voted to stage a nationwide strike from April 20 but the move has failed to unnerve the country's normally jumpy private coffee exporters.
The Colombian Truck Drivers' Association (ACC), which represents about 80 percent of the nation's truckers, has called the stoppage to protest transport companies' failure to fulfill an agreement to raise freight rates, which was hammered out at the end of a crippling 11-day strike last October.
That strike paralyzed all the country's road freight including 200,000 60-kg bags of coffee.
But one private coffee exporter, who did not wish to be named, said he was confident his firm would be able to fulfill its April export schedule before the latest strike hit.
""Most people will try and move their coffee quickly so that we don't have problems with the truckers,"" he said.
He estimated Colombia's total export commitments for April, including private and National Coffee Growers' Federation exports, amounted to about 520,000 60-kg bags.
Another private exporter, who declined to be named, even doubted the ACC strike would materialize. He believed it had been set a month in advance as a means of pressuring the transport companies and the government into seeking a negotiated solution.
""This is a joke, setting a strike one month in advance. If they were going to strike I think they would have gone out straight away,"" he said.
""Even if there is a strike then we're already preparing April shipments, the coffee is currently being processed and it should all be shipped by April 20,"" he added.
The exporter calculated that a strike starting April 20 could last for at least 10 days before it began to have the slightest impact on coffee export schedules.
On voting the strike last weekend, one of the ACC leaders Mario Quiroga said it had been necessary to set the strike date a month in advance in order to inform members and prepare the action.
When asked about the possible impact of the stoppage on coffee, he said: ""Of course it will have an impact on coffee and everything else because we will not be moving a single kilo of freight along Colombia's roads.""
In addition to higher freight rates, the October deal, which the ACC says was not fulfilled by transport companies, included extra payments to truckers waiting to on- and off-load goods and a pledge from the government to revise vehicle licensing fees and highway tolls.
In further strike news, Colombia's main dock workers' union SINTRAMARITIMO is threatening to call a fresh stoppage at the main pacific coast port of Buenaventura. In similar circumstances to the truck drivers, the dockers say that cargo operators never fulfilled the deal hammered out to end their January strike, which would have granted them an increase in wages and sickness, injury and social security entitlements.
The nine-day strike by dockers in January wreaked havoc with coffee exports -- about 60 percent of Colombia's coffee is shipped out through Buenaventura. More than 300,000 60-kg bags were locked in port.
In a fresh twist, Nelson Amaya, the regional head of the Unitary Workers' Confederation (CUT), to which SINTRAMARITIMO is affiliated, warned a new port strike could have more serious consequences than that in January.
In a whirlwind recruitment drive last week, Amaya signed up an additional 5,000 hitherto non-unionized members in the Atlantic coast ports of Cartagena, Barranquilla and Santa Marta, and said they too would heed any strike call.
Dock workers are scheduled to meet on April 1 to vote on whether to call a new strike. Amaya said the atmosphere in Buenaventura was ""healthy"" but said the dockgo operators' failure to keep their side of the bargain.

4644,"Hefty budget cuts are sounding the death knell for Colombia's efforts to reverse social inequalities and undermine guerrilla movements in the poorest areas of the country, politicians and analysts say.
President Ernesto Samper announced in January that he would slash 1.3 trillion pesos (about $1 billion) from the 1997 budget to rein in a yawning fiscal deficit. He pledged that social spending and public works would not be affected.
But Finance Minister Jose Antonio Ocampo said earlier this week that more than two-thirds of the spending cuts would hit precisely those sectors the president said would be spared.
A central plank of his 1994 election platform was the so- called ""social leap forward"" that aimed to end the chronic isolation of many rural communities, virtually cut off from the rest of the country by poor access and communications.
""This is a significant step backwards for the social leap. The social programme has been failing for some time, and these cuts leave it virtually dead,"" said ruling Liberal Party Sen. Luis Guillermo Giraldo.
He accused Samper of taking the easy route by cutting funds for health, education, hygiene, drinking water and rural programmes instead of pruning government bureaucracy that soaks up three quarters of the cash destined for social spending.
Political analyst Eduardo Pisarro doubted that the reduction in social spending would spark protests among Colombia's poor, who stand to be most affected by the cuts.
But he said it would do little to loosen the grip of Marxist revolutionaries, already estimated by some analysts and defence officials to have de facto political and economic control over 40 percent of Colombia.
""Colombia has traditionally had a weak welfare state and so the impact (of these cuts) will be much less immediate. But one can forsee that the guerrilla and other groups will maintain their capacity to recruit followers in pockets of poverty,"" said Pisarro.
Armando Montenegro, head of the influential National Association of Financial Institutions (ANIF), welcomed the cuts and believed they would stem the fiscal deficit that ran at 4 percent of gross domestic product last year.
He argued that the social impact would be minimal, saying: ""Social investment is so inefficient and there's so much waste that in any event the money would not have reached the poor people.""
Montenegro hoped the budget reduction would open the way for wider private sector participation in infrastructure projects, such as road building. But he thought few private firms would be interested in building roads to remote areas needed by peasant farmers to take their produce to market.
Agriculture and defence are the other areas that will bear the brunt of the cutbacks, although the revised budget for military spending of about $350 billion pesos will be more than doubled thanks to a cash injection from the mandatory sale of so-called ""war bonds"" to rich Colombians.
Individuals or businesses with a net worth of more than $85,000 are required to spend 0.5 percent of their funds above $85,000 to purchase five-year bonds, which the government is using to finance the military.

4650,"The Czech Republic recorded its first budget deficit, despite last ditch efforts by its fiscally-hawkish government to achieve its fourth consecutive surplus.
The government a final effort in December when the budget looked headed for a more than five billion crown deficit, by freezing some outlays until 1997, and requiring early repayment on credit granted to a deposit insurance fund.
But the measures were not enough and the Finance Ministry announced on Friday that definitive results show the budget ending 1996 with a deficit of 1.562 billion crowns.
Ministry spokeswoman Ludmila Nutilova said revenues for the year totalled 482.8 billion crowns, while expenditures were 484.3 billion.
The Czechs have had three year-end budget surpluses since Czechoslovakia split in 1993.
Fiannce ministry officials have said that the deficit may edge up even further since more bills may be delivered after the deadline.
The budget has been hampered continually by lower-than-expected tax revenue and delayed repayment on credits to Russia.
The 1996 budget was originally approved as a balanced budget totalling 497.6 billion crowns, but an autumn round of spending cuts knocked the forecast expenditure down to 491 billion crowns.
Parliamentary budget committee chairman Jozef Wagner, a member of the largest opposition party, the Social Democrats, said the 1996 deficit was not troublesome, but he was concerned with the effects government payment adjustments may have on the 1997 budget.
Part of the December stop-gap measures included postponing payment of 800 million crowns in state subsidies for housing loans which was due to the partially-privatised banks Ceska Sporitelna a.s. and IPB a.s.
Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, who calls balanced budgets the ""alpha and omega"" of his government, hailed initial reports of a 1996 budget surplus, made by the finance ministry soon after the new year, as a sign of the country's continued fiscal responsibility.
Parliament approved a fifth straight balanced budget plan in December, with both expenditures and revenues forecast at 549.1 billion crowns in 1997.
But the 1997 budget was based on economic growth of 5.4 percent, and many independent analysts have forecast growth for this year at under five percent, after growth between 4.0 and 4.5 percent for the whole of 1996.
Many have voiced concern that slower than expected economic growth might force the government to consider major changes in the 1997 budget to keep a much larger deficit at bay.

4652,"The Czech central bank, for the second time in a week, said on Tuesday that it was prepared to intervene to stop the crown from strengthening further, pushing the crown lower and prompting a sell-off by London traders.
""Our starting point is that parity is a base, and this is the right level (for the crown),"" Jiri Pospisil, the head of the Czech National Bank's (CNB) monetary department, told an economic conference.
After the comment, the crown was still well above its mark/dollar basket midpoint at 28.750/dollar 16.873/mark, or 3.68 percent over parity with the basket, but down nearly 100 basis points from the CNB's daily fixing at +4.65 percent.
""There is a debate going on at the central bank over the nature of the appreciation of the exchange rate, and on the most suitable way to react to it,"" Pospisil, who is also on the CNB board, said.
""The debate has not been finished but our possibilities are clear: either we can react through interest rates or through direct intervention on the market,"" he added.
One of post-Communist Europe's most stable currencies, the crown consistently reached record highs in late January and early February, fuelled by demand brought about by a wave of more than 30 billion crowns in Eurobond issues since the start of the year.
The crown's surge has also been boosted by investors taking advantage of interest rate spreads against major currencies and an inverted yield curve.
Dealers said Pospisil's comments had shaken the market, especially some foreign investors, and could force the crown down further before it finds support.
""This has really shaken the market badly,"" said one London analyst. ""I think a sell-off could push it down to as low as three percent above parity before finding some support.""
It was the second time in the past week that central bank comments have pushed the crown sharply lower.
Last Wednesday the central bank said it had the option of intervening on the market when necessary, prompting London dealers to bail out over the next two days and pushing the crown down some 200 basis points against parity.
Despite Pospisil's words, dealers said that it did not appear that any intervention was imminent as it could not lower rates due to concerns over controlling the money supply and inflation.
""I think the central bank is trying to make the crown more volatile by its comments, but I'm not sure if it is ready to do anything real such as intervene,"" said Breta Tichanek of ING Bank. ""They are just trying to push the crown back to parity by letting the market do it in its own way,"" he added.
The CNB has not intervened since last February when it propped up the crown after widening the fixing corridor to plus/minus 7.5 percent against the basket from 0.5 percent.
The CNB's repo rate remains solidly at 12.4 percent, while its discount rate has been at 10.5 percent since it was raised a full percentage point last June. Meanwhile, inflation in January slowed to 7.4 percent, year-on-year, from 8.6 percent in December.

4654,"The Czech Republic's trade deficit nearly doubled in January, year-on-year, as exports stagnated, and analysts said they saw little change in the trend of the burgeoning trade shortfall.
The Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) on Monday said the January trade deficit hit 13.6 billion crowns compared with a 7.86 billion crown deficit in January 1996.
The CSU added that imports, led by continued strong inflows of machinery and raw materials, grew by 8.2 percent year-on-year, while exports contracted by 2.5 percent, spurred by a sharp 11.8 percent decrease in raw material exports.
""The figures are better than expected...the market expected above 15 billion crowns...but I don't think it will mean any change in the trade (balance's) development,"" said Petr Tomek of Zivnostenska Banka.
The bureau did not issue a revised end-year 1996 figure for the trade balance, which hit a record 160.3 billion crowns. It has forecast the 1997 trade deficit to rise to about 215 billion crowns.
The CSU said overall nominal imports for January firmed to 60.04 billion crowns from 55.5 billion for the same month last year, while exports totalled 46.45 billion, down from a previous 47.63 billion.
Boris Gomez of ING Barings said that while January's trade figures were an improvement from December, where the monthly figure was 17.996 billion crowns, the beginning of the year is traditionally a period of slowing trade.
""We're not overly encouraged since historically the first two months of the year we usually see relatively lower deficits because of generally weaker trade flows,"" he said.
""We are hoping for a stabilisation of the deficit. If what happened last year when the deficit picked up pace in the second quarter, it's not good, though we are banking on import growth slowing a bit given the tight monetary environment.""
Last summer the central bank tightened its monetary policy, raising its discount rate one full percentage point to 10.5 percent, and minimum reserve requirements on primary deposits to 11.5 percent from 8.5 percent. Interbank money market rates up to three months in the Republic hover around 12.5 percent.
Analysts added that the trade figures were also influenced by the strengthening of the currency, the crown, which gained some three percentage points against its dollar/mark basket in January, boosted by demand brought about by a wave of over 35 billion crowns worth crown-denominated Eurobonds.
""If the Bundesbank sees it policy down the road of keeping the mark relatively weak to help the economy, that's not good news for the Czechs, nor are the rumblings that the economic recovery of the EU may be slower than expected,"" Gomez said.
CSU figures showed EU countries accounted for more than 60 percent of both imports and exports with the Czech Republic.

Klaus, speaking after a meeting on financial market regulation on Sunday, said the market was moving from its first phase, when it was created under the mass voucher privatisation programme of 1992-95, towards becoming a standard market.
He added that everybody understood that this process would happen gradually.
But analysts and traders said that while the moves are a welcome start, only concrete results will now be able to lure investors back to the market.
""It shows a trend that the government knows there is a problem and is working on solutions,"" said Jan Sykora, a broker at Wood and Company.
""But confidence in the Czech market has been decimated and there is a strong lack of confidence, especially among foreign investors...who now want to see real results, and not just proclamations.""
Added Radim Bajgar of ING Barings: ""It's positive, but we have heard these announcements before -- results will be the best medicine for the market.""
While markets in Poland and Budapest have posted solid gains this year, the Prague Stock Exchange has sputtered, especially since the beginning of September when a bear run triggered by a foreign investor selloff took some 20 percent out of the ailing bourse.
These investors, and some local players, have been highly critical of the lack of transparency on Czech markets, and particularly about the failure of the Securites Centre, where the overwhelming majority of trades are registered, to release detailed price information.
""A lot international clients shudder when you mention the Czech market. They just don't know what real prices here are because so little information comes from the Securities Centre, where so much of the trading occurs,"" said one fund manager.
Until now, Klaus has showed little enthusiasm for a plan by PSE Chairman Tomas Jezek to create a body modelled on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Klaus has long believed market regulation, now conducted by a department in the Finance Ministry, should be minimal.
But he capitulated on Sunday, saying ""there is a dominant opinion that there is little transparency on the our capital market"".
""As a long-term solution we want to create an independent capital supervision (body). That requires legislation and an number of other things,"" said Klaus following the meeting.
He also announced that all prices of OTC deals registered at the central securities centre (SCP) would be published from February 1. He gave no indication of whether the names of buyers and sellers would also be released.
Jezek wants to create a Czech SEC by 1998 but Klaus gave no indication of when he thought it could be set up.
Klaus said that as a first step the market supervision department of the Finance Ministry would be transformed into a ""Securities Bureau"" also from February 1, 1997.
It would remain under the ministry but would have more staff and an 11-member advisory commission for the bureau would also be set up including market participants. The bureau would intensify control of investment funds and companies, he said.
Analysts said that once more regulation did find its way to the market, those same investors who have shunned Czech shares will probably return.
""Because most foreign investors have such a poor view of this market, they are under-invested here. So once you start to create better conditions, you should see it translate into a strong positive trend next year,"" Sykora said.

4669,"The Prague Stock Exchange, boosted by strong blue chip gains, hit a year-high on Thursday, but analysts said any strong bullish sentiment was tempered by a lack of liquidity and low foreign investor interest.
At the heart of the bourse's rise has been a resurgence of the market's two most-capitalised issues -- SPT Telecom and CEZ -- which account for over one-third of the PX50 index.
Both hits 52-week highs at the daily price fixing on Thursday to push the index 1.1 percent higher to 586.5, but analysts cautioned that the market was still plagued by a lack of liquidity, which was distorting price movements.
""Volumes are very thin, when you come to the market looking for a bigger parcel of shares it doesn't take much interest to move the prices. But the truth is, not a lot of foreign money is flowing in,"" said Jan Sykora of Wood and Company.
SPT Telecom shares, which account for 20 percent of the PSE's market capitalisation, jumped 85 crowns to 3,660, while CEZ, which account for 14 percent, rose 34 crowns to 1,193.
Dealers said they did not see any fundamental reasons for SPT shares to rise much further, but that CEZ could climb another two or three percent.
The PSE has recently showed signs of life after a fourth quarter 1996 slump took 25 percent off the index after a lack of commitment on the part of government officials to strengthen minority shareholder rights and increase market transparency undermined the market.
The index has gained a modest 8.7 percent so far in 1997, and a new commitment from Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and bourse officials to clean up the market is slowly luring back many disgruntled foreign investors.
Though it may not be a panacea to the market woes, most analysts agree that the oversight commission could be the most important step the PSE could take in 1997.

""The market will probably edge up slightly with such low liquidity. Hopefully when 1996 earnings begin to come in the bourse will have a new impetus,"" he added. Company results are expected to begin flowing in at the beginning of March.

The crown has gained some three percent against its dollar/mark basket since the beginning of the year, and analysts have predicted it will hold its value or strengthen further in the coming weeks.

4675,"The Czech Republic took both reverse singles matches from India on Sunday clinching a berth in the second round of the Davis Cup, but lost its number one player, Petr Korda in the process.
Jiri Novak gave the Czechs a 3-2 victory with a straight set 6-1 6-4 6-3 victory over Mahesh Bhupathi after Korda, who announced he was retiring from Davis Cup play, had brought his team level with a 5-7 6-3 6-4 6-1 win over Leander Paes.
Novak barely broke a sweat against Bhupathi, who is ranked more than 400 places lower, needing just 90 minutes to dispatch the Indian number two.
Jumping out to a quick start, Novak, ranked 67th in the world, took the first set 6-1 and went up 5-0 in the second before losing his rythmn, and four consecutive games. But he regrouped to hold serve in the tenth game for the set.
He then broke Bhupathi twice in the third set to clinch the tie. ""This is one of the biggest matches I have won in my life,"" said an elated Novak following the match.
Korda, ranked 33rd in the world, also had little trouble in his matchup with Paes, overpowering the Indian at the net and unleashing powerful groundstrokes from the baseline.
He squandered five break points in the first set, while Paes, ranked 105th in the world, took advantage of the only one he had to take the first set in 53 minutes.
But Korda showed no signs of a cold that has plagued him throughout the week, quickly getting back on track to take the next three sets.
""Overall though, I am still really happy both myself and the team performed,"" said Olympic bronze medalist Paes.
After the win, Korda said he would no longer play for the Czechs in the Davis Cup, complaining of the demands it put on a player.
""There was a lot of pressure on me for this match, but I showed the kind of player I am,"" he said.
""I have thought about retiring (from Davis Cup) for a while and it's time to leave. It is a very tiring, draining experience and I think you should leave at the top. Now is the right time.""
Korda, who was once ranked as high as fifth in the world, has been the anchor of the Czech team since his debut in 1988, compiling a 30-12 overall record, including three wins against India this weekend.
The loss of Korda is the second setback for last year's semifinalists, after Czech number two Daniel Vacek bowed out of action to concentrate more on his performance on the ATP tour.

4677,"The United States on Tuesday raised the stakes in a battle to supply NATO aspirants in central Europe with advanced fighter aircraft by offering the Czechs free use of seven Navy Hornet jets for five years.
Representatives of the U.S. Navy, on behalf of the U.S. government, offered to lease the Czech Republic seven McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 ""Hornet"" fighter planes under a no-cost, five-year agreement, McDonnell Douglas Corp.said.
Czech officials reacted warmly to the offer, saying the support of the U.S. government was welcome, but that it did not guarantee success for the bid.
""We welcome the U.S. government's support but we will look at all bids. We have experts who will examine all of them and investigate which is the best,"" said Petr Necas, chairman of the parliamentary defence committee after a meeting with U.S. Navy vice-admiral John Allen Lockard.
On offer are six single-seat F/A-18A and one two-seat F/A-18B aircraft currently used by the U.S. Navy.
The offer also includes the supply, at cost, of replacement parts, pilot and ground personnel training programmes and support equipment. ""Supply and service costs will be the subject of further discussions,"" a company statement said.
""The advantage of the lease is that it allows the Czechs to quickly obtain the Hornets, and they would gain almost immediate operational and maintenance experience with these aircraft,"" McDonnell Douglas spokeswoman Barbara Anderson told Reuters.
""As opposed to purchasing, they can take that experience and then make a more sound purchase decision later,"" she added.
Also competing for post-Cold War business in central Europe are U.S. Lockheed Martin, which makes F-16s primarily for the U.S. Air Force, the Anglo-Swedish consortium of SAAB and British Aerospace,, which makes the Gripen, and France's Dassault Aviation makers of the Mirage.
Necas expressed disappointment that governments from other competing countries had failed to step forward formally to lend their support, saying it appeared the U.S. was far more active in the pursuit of a contract.
""I have to say that it's too bad for the Czech side that the activity of the French, Swedish or British governments from the perspective of cooperating (with their companies)...isn't comparable with that of the U.S.,"" he said.
The Czech government, seeking to prepare for eventual membership in NATO, has been debating whether to buy any aircraft as proposed cuts in defence spending have clouded the debate over the upgrading of the fleet.
The Czechs, along with Poland and Hungary, are seen as leading candidates for early NATO membership, when the western security alliance expands.
Czech defence officials have said they have the will but not the wallet to buy brand new Western-made advanced fighters, but are keeping their options open as a battle over the long-term military budget goes on.
They have said they would need about 24 fighters to replace their ageing Soviet made MiG-21s to be more compatible with NATO, but at more than $20 million per fighter, new western planes are too pricey.
Czech pilots could begin training in the planes in six months, with delivery of the aircraft 18 months after the contract is signed, the statement said.
To strengthen its bid, McDonnell Douglas also said that it is preparing to locate component production for the Hornet at Czech Aero Vodochody a.s. regardless of whether new or leased aircraft are chosen to re-equip the Czech Air Force.
Cooperation could also include Czech engineering concern Skoda a.s., the firm added.

4678,"The Czech Republic has recorded its first budget deficit despite last ditch efforts by the government, which has staked its reputation on fiscal responsibility, to achieve a fourth consecutive surplus.
The Finance Ministry said on Friday that definitive data showed the budget ending 1996 with a deficit of 1.56 billion Czech crowns ($57.28 million).
Modest though the budget may be by Western standards, it was the first shortfall since the Czech Republic became a sovereign nation in 1993 following the demise of Czechoslovakia.
The centre-right government made a final effort to balance the books in December when the budget seemed to be heading for a deficit of more than five billion crowns.
It postponed some spending until 1997, and required early repayment of credit granted to a deposit insurance fund.
Finance Ministry spokeswoman Ludmila Nutilova said revenues for 1996 totalled 482.8 billion crowns, while expenditures were 484.3 billion.
Ministry officials have said the deficit might edge up even further since more bills might be delivered after the deadline.
The budget has been hampered continually by lower than expected tax revenue and delayed repayment of credits to Russia.
The original 1996 budget was balanced with spending and revenue at 497.6 billion crowns, but an autumn round of cuts knocked the forecast expenditure down to 491 billion crowns.
Parliamentary budget committee chairman Jozef Wagner, a member of the opposition Social Democrats, said the 1996 deficit was not troublesome. But he was concerned about the effects that government payment adjustments might have on the 1997 budget.
Part of the December stop-gap measures included postponing payment of 800 million crowns in state subsidies for housing loans which had been due to the partially-privatised banks Ceska Sporitelna a.s. and IPB a.s.
Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, who calls balanced budgets the ""alpha and omega"" of his government, hailed initial reports of a 1996 budget surplus made by the finance ministry soon after the New Year, as a sign of continued fiscal responsibility.
Parliament approved a fifth straight balanced budget plan in December, with both expenditures and revenues forecast at 549.1 billion crowns in 1997.
But the 1997 budget was based on economic growth of 5.4 percent, and many independent analysts have forecast growth for this year at under five percent, after growth between 4.0 and 4.5 percent for the whole of 1996.
Many have voiced concern that slower than expected economic growth might force the government to consider major changes in the 1997 budget to keep a much larger deficit at bay.

4681,"Czech annual average consumer inflation eased slightly in 1996, pleasing analysts even though the rate overshot original government forecasts.
The Czech Statistical Bureau said on Thursday that its key sliding average inflation figure closed the year at 8.8 percent, down from 9.1 percent in 1995.
Despite missing the government's original eight percent forecast, analysts said they were optimistic the central bank's tight monetary policies were bringing inflation back under control after a first half surge.
""The final outcome on average inflation is a success because of its favourable development in the second half of the year,"" said Martin Kupka, economist at investment bank Patria Finance.
""Of course in the longer run, we still need to see a more rapid decrease in inflation,"" he told Reuters.
The Bureau said month-on-month inflation for December was 0.5 percent, unchanged from November. This put consumer prices 8.6 percent higher than the same month last year, also unchanged from November.
Bureau chairman Edvard Outrata told Reuters that 1996 core inflation remained around five percent, with government price deregulation accounting for the rest.
But 1997 inflation would depend on whether the government took further, stronger steps on freeing up energy and housing prices, he said.
Price increases in the foodstuffs, leisure and textile sectors accounted for about 80 percent of the monthly CPI rise.
Other Bureau data showed that industrial output slowed in November to an increase of only 1.4 percent year-on-year, from a 5.3 percent rise in output in October, while industrial wages were 17.1 percent higher for the first 11 months of the year.
After the release of the figures, Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy said wage growth without productivity increases stemmed from a lack of industrial restructuring.
""We thought it (inflation) would be lower, and what I see, above all, is a fundamental wage problem,"" he said.
""The slower restructuring in some companies...is also a source of inflation, because it is generating inflationary money, mainly through rising wages, without a respective effect (in output),"" Dlouhy added.
The government battled wage growth throughout the economy with wage controls, ended in 1995, which tied rising wages to corresponding increases in industrial output.
Pay rises in 1996, not matched by an increase in productivity, have accelerated an already large trade deficit, by sparking domestic demand which has in turn caused higher inflation and made exported goods less competitive.
Boris Gomez of ING Barings Capital Markets said that attempts to force inflation down further in 1997 might be thwarted if wage growth could not be brought under control.
""The December CPI figure was positive even though there was a strong Christmas shopping spree by Czechs...But we still are concerned about the effects of wage growth since it will be tough for the government to cap it,"" he said.
Most analysts agreed that the central bank would continue its tight monetary policies at least for the first quarter of 1997 to keep a lid on inflationary pressures.
The Czech crown is expected to remain stable in the short-term despite the problems in cutting inflation. Traders said the crown was unaffected by December's CPI figures since they were in line with forecasts.
The central bank fixed the crown on Thursday at 3.72 percent above its dollar/mark basket midpoint, slightly stronger than its +3.57 percent fixing the previous day.

4703,"Australia's largest home mortgage lender, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), announced a surprisingly strong 11 percent surge in first half 1996/97 profits on Wednesday, despite erosion of its interest margins.
CBA said good cost control and a 33 percent surge in business lending more than offset a further squeeze in home loan margins.
""Business volumes during the first half of 1996/97 were pleasing, leading to a better than expected interim result,"" CBA managing director David Murray told a news conference.
""This is likely to lead to a slightly better than expected full-year result,"" Murray said.
CBA's net profit for the six months to December 31 rose to A$602 million (US$455 million) from A$542 million in the comparable period a year earlier.
CBA had itself been saying until now that it expected hot competition in its key home loan market would squeeze margins and keep profits flat in the year to June 30, 1997.
Analysts too had expected a subdued profit performance, forecasting a profit of between A$535 million and A$560 million.
CBA's shares rallied sharply on the profit and on news of a interim dividend of 45 cents per share, up seven cents on the previous interim dividend.
CBA's shares closed up 50.1 cents at A$13.91, having climbed in afternoon trade to a record high of A$14.00. CBA's surge led the All Ordinaries index overall to a record closing high of 2,473.5, up 25.4 points.
""Obviously the market liked it. The profit was probably about A$50 million above expectations and there was a nice increase in the dividend,"" said Lance Jones dealer Hamish Dee.
Analysts later said they would increase their forecasts for CBA's full-year profit by about A$50 million to A$1.15 billion.
But CBA dampened optimism about its business lending boom on Wednesday by cutting its key varible home mortgage rate to 7.55 percent from 8.25 percent, ensuring further margin pressure.
CBA's group net interest margin fell to 3.71 percent in the first half from 4.12 percent in the first half of 1995/96 and Murray said the latest cut would further erode margins.
This is CBA's second unilateral home loan interest rate cut in less than a year. The bank cut its key variable home loan rate to 9.9 percent from 10.5 percent in May.
That cut triggered a round of mortgage rate cuts by the other major banks and was generally seen as the catalyst to a 50 to 75 basis point cut in big bank home loan margins.
But CBA's pre-emptive strike was also popular with home lenders, who increased their lending from the bank by 14 percent in the half.
Murray said the latest home loan cuts had more to do with increasingly aggressive competition in the home loan market than with any pre-emption of another cut in official cash rates.
Non bank lenders like Aussie Home Loans have snared about 10 percent of the home loan market in the last three years with cheap loans funded by securitised bond issues.
CBA also said its efforts to control costs and increase productivity were a factor in the better than expected profit.
Meanwhile, CBA confirmed that it was looking closely at securitising some of its mortgage portfolio and that it was not looking at issuing a special dividend, contrary to speculation.

4707,"Investment bank Natwest Markets Australia Ltd said on Tuesday it aimed to hold on to its leading market share in equities broking in Australia in 1997 but would stay clear of the burgeoning mortgage securitisation sector.
""The first thing is to make sure we maintain our market position,"" Natwest Markets Australia Ltd chief executive Peter St George told Reuters in an interview. ""We want to broaden and deepen our penetration of the market,"" St George said.  
Natwest Markets currently leads the rankings of equities brokers in Australia as measured by the latest Australian Stock Exchange data with a 9.8 percent market share.
St George said Natwest would need to widen its research and distribution activities to keep up with the likely changes in the Australian stock market over the next two to three years.
The impending privatisation of Australia's largest telecoms group, Telstra Corp, as well as the sale of government-owned airports and the demutualisation of Australia's largest insurance and investment group, The Australian Mutual Provident Society, would change the shape of the market overall, he said.  
""If you look on a two to three year horizon you should see big movements in the market in telecoms, infrastructure and insurance,"" St George said.
""These are some changes for people to get their research capabilities and international delivery mechanisms in place for,"" he said.
Earlier on Tuesday Natwest Markets Australia, a unit of National Westminister Bank Plc, reported a 40 percent rise in operating profit before tax to A$70.5 million for calendar 1996.  
""The areas we will focus on in terms of the equities business are advancing some of the work we've been doing in the structured products and derivatives products,"" St George said.
Natwest's debt and corporate finance divisions would aim to extend non-government debt operations but would stay away from the structuring of securitised mortgage deals for now, he said.
""In the debt markets, we're getting away from some of the meatier bonds like government bonds and looking into some of the other areas, like corporate bonds and infrastructure financing,"" he said.  
St George said Natwest Markets was involved on a large scale in the mortgage securitisation market in the United States and elsewhere but would concentrate on the wholesale sector in Australia.
""It's quite labour intensive. It hasn't been attractive to us because we don't think the profits are there,"" he said.
""I wouldn't particularly think we're going to make a big move in there at this point in time.""
Natwest Australia Corporate Finance currently manages the wholesale securitised vehicles, Prime Asset Vehicle (PAV) 1 and PAV 2.  
""They take really high quality paper and recyle those into the United States and international markets,"" he said.

4708,"Transport equipment hire and logistics firm Brambles Industries Ltd said on Friday that it was on track to achieve current market expectations for a full year net profit of about A$240 million.
Brambles chief executive John Fletcher told Reuters in an interview that analysts should not extrapolate the stronger than expected first half profit growth into the full 1996/97 year.
""The message is that the existing market expectations for the full year that were there before this announcement, they're still looking O.K,"" Fletcher said.  
He said the average of the Barceps survey of analysts' forecasts for the 1996/97 year to June 30 was A$240.3 million.
This would be a near 12 percent rise for the full year on the A$214.8 million pre-abnormal net profit posted in 1995/96.
Earlier, Brambles reported its first half net profit rose 14.3 percent to A$117.2 million. There were no abnormals. Pre-abnormal profit rose almost 15 percent to A$117.2 million.
But Brambles warned in its profit statement that it expected the rate of improvement evident in the first half to slow in the second half because of difficult trading conditions in Australia and Europe and a smaller boost from lower net interest costs.  
Fletcher said economic conditions in Australia remained subdued in the transport and logistics sectors and were likely to stay that way for the remainder of the 1996/97 year.
""Volumes are flat and the unions are looking for five to six percent per annum wage increases,"" he said.
He said Brambles and others servicing the manufacturing sector, which was under intense price pressure from imports, were stuck between union demands for higher wages and the inability to pass higher costs in the form of higher prices.
""I don't think we're in a position to look for wage increases of four to five percent,"" he said.

4718,"Australia's largest locally-owned investment bank posted a stronger than expected annual profit on Monday, citing bullish investment markets and steady flow of corporate advisory work as the driving factors.
Macquarie Bank Ltd's net profit for the year to March 31 rose 25.4 percent to A$116.94 million, producing a return on average shareholder funds or equity of 25.2 percent.
Macquarie raised its annual dividend to 43 cents from 36 cents a year earlier on an earnings per share rise to 74.9 cents per share from 61 cents per share.  
Analysts had forecast a net profit of around A$105 million.
""All five major business groups performed well,"" Macquarie Bank Managing Director Allan Moss told a news conference.
""We were assisted by by favourable market conditions, with a good level of corporate activity and fairly strong security markets,"" he said.
The Australian stock market rose 8.7 percent over the year to March 31 and 10 year bond yields fell to 8.16 percent from 8.81 percent.  
Macquarie's Corporate Advisory division, which advises companies on takeovers and mergers, benefitted from an active year of corporate plays and had 130 advisory mandates, up significantly from 1995/96.
Among others, Macquarie advised Placer Dome Inc on its takeover of Highlands Gold Ltd and TNT on its response to a bid by Dutch postal and telecoms group KPN NV.
However, Macquarie's advisory work with TNT produced the bank's one major hiccup for the year.  
One of Macquarie's most senior corporate advisory executives, Simon Hannes, was charged with insider trading last month after he allegedly bought TNT options before KPN's takeover bid and made a notional profit of A$2 million.
Hannes, who was not working on the TNT project, allegedly had access to TNT documents at Macquarie.
His lawyers have said he would be pleading not guilty.
Moss said the Hannes matter had not affected corporate advisory work and was not expected to in the current year.  
""Our perception is that flow of business was unaffected by the Hannes matter, because our clients recognise this matter relates to an individual and not the bank as a whole,"" he said.
Meanwhile, Moss and analysts said the outlook for Macquarie was as bullish as that for the market overall, due in large part to low interest rates.
""With interest rates continuing to be low and perhaps going down a little bit further, there's every prospect for a reasonably good year in equity markets and we're also seeing quite a good flow in corporate activity,"" he said.  
Australian stocks have risen another eight percent since balance date, while bond markets have also strengthened further.
Analysts said the result was stronger than expected. ""It's all looking fairly healthy, given the outlook for the market in general,"" said a Sydney analyst who had forecast A$110 million.
Investors welcomed the result and talk of an eventual capital return, boosting Macquarie's stock four cents to A$9.50 at the close, near its A$9.60 all-time high.  
Moss said an expected change to the way Macquarie's capital adequacy ratio was calculated was likely to boost its ratio to 16 percent in coming years from its current 13.2 percent, raising the possibility of a capital return through a share buy back or higher dividend payout ratio.

4721,"A 22 percent rise in fee and other non-interest income boosted Westpac Banking Corp Ltd to a surprisingly strong first half profit result on Wednesday, more than offsetting the effect of a squeeze on interest margins.
Westpac announced a net profit of A$638 million for the six months to March 31, up from A$565 million in the same period a year earlier.  
Analysts said this was about A$20 million to A$30 million above their expectations, but had not shocked those in the market who had pushed Westpac's share price higher in recent weeks in anticipation of very strong result.
""That's why the stock hasn't bounced as much as you'd expect it to,"" Macquarie Equities banking analyst Graham Maloney said.
Westpac's shares were down five cents at A$7.45 at 3.40 p.m. (0540 GMT), having earlier jumped to a A$7.60 high.  
The profit jump was due largely to non-interest income rising to A$869 million from A$714 million, underpinned by rising account fees and some profits from the sale of property and closed branches.
The boost from fees more than offset sluggish growth in interest income as Westpac, like Australia's other major banks, battled a 150 basis point squeeze in home lending margins.
Westpac's group net interest margin fell to 3.55 percent in the six months to March 31 from 3.75 percent in the six months to September.  
Non-bank competitors funded by mortgage origination have snared more than 10 percent of the home mortgage market in the past three years, forcing banks to cut their home loan margins by about 150 basis points to about 100 to 150 basis points.
""Features of the first half financial results were non-interest expense control, continued improvement in asset quality, improved staff productivity, and higher non-interest income reflecting: growth in commissions and fees, higher financial markets income and benefits from the sale of equity investments,"" Westpac managing director Bob Joss said in a statement.  
""These results were achieved against a background of reduced interest margins and continued investments in strategic capabilities designed to enhance future prospects,"" Joss said.
Westpac's net interest income fell to A$1.695 billion in the six months ended March 31 from A$1.705 billion in the six months to September 30 last year, but was up on the A$1.549 billion in the year-ago period.
Income from fees and commissions rose to A$592 million from A$532 million in the year-ago first half.
Other income, which included the sale of equity investments, rose to A$142 million from A$68 million a year earlier.  
Westpac also announced it planned to raise up to A$500 million through a preference share issue after its merger with Bank of Melbourne Ltd.
Westpac said it would issue up to 20 million non-cumulative converting preference share at an issue price of A$25 each. The money raised would be used to fund the cash component under the Bank of Melbourne merger scheme, it said.

4728,"Australia's Westpac Banking Corp, struggling like its fellow major banks to cope with a savage interest margin squeeze, surprised analysts on Wednesday by posting a strong profit rise in the first half year.
Higher income from bank account and transaction fees and a series of property sale profits more than offset the squeeze on home lending margins, boosting net profit for the six months to March 31 by 12.9 percent to A$638 million (US$496 million).
Westpac increased its interim dividend to 19 cents from 16 cents after earnings per share (EPS) rose to 34.4 cents from 29.2 cents. The EPS rise was helped by a share buy-back.
Analysts had expected a profit of about A$610 million after Westpac warned late last year about the margin squeeze and foreshadowed flat profits.
The market however had in recent weeks has taken a more optimistic view of the likely profit result than the analysts, boosting Westpac's share price 16 percent in the last month.
""That's why the stock hasn't bounced as much as you'd expect it to,"" Macquarie Equities banking analyst Graham Maloney said.
Westpac's shares closed down five cents at A$7.45 after a rise straight after the result to A$7.60.
Westpac Managing Director Bob Joss welcomed the profit rise as a solid result, but said it would be difficult to repeat the 12.9 percent rise in the second half because of what he said was a tremendous squeeze on lending margins.
""I think that it will be very hard to do in the second half given the margin pressures that we're seeing through all parts of our product range,"" Westpac Managing Director Bob Joss told a news conference.
Joss said however he expected the full year profit for the year to September 30 would be higher than the A$1.132 billion posted in 1995/96.
Australia's major banks have been forced in the last year to cut about 150 basis points off their home lending margins by red hot competition from non-banks that are funded by mortgage origination. These mortgage originators have snared about 10 to 12 percent of the Australian market in the last three years.
Westpac's group net interest margin fell to 3.55 percent in the six months to March 31 from 3.75 percent in the six months to September, which cost Westpac about A$88 million in the half.
Westpac's increases in bank fees and charges had not fully offset the effect of this margin squeeze, Joss said. Westpac's accounts showed Westpac's account keeping and transaction fee income rose to A$379 million from A$306 million a year earlier.
""There's constant pressure on margins so there's a test to do the best we can on fees, on lowering costs and increasing efficiencies,"" Joss said.

4729,"Papua New Guinea's (PNG) Australian-listed stocks slumped five to ten percent on Monday as international investors fearful of a law and order meltdown reacted to the army's attempt to force the PNG government aside.
Orogen Minerals Ltd, which is 51 percent owned by the PNG government, was one of the hardest hit, slumping seven percent or 24 cents to A$3.20. 
Other stocks jagged as much as ten percent lower in increasingly hectic afternoon trade as reports emerged that the head of the army and the police commissioner had told Prime Minister Julius Chan to resign or be forced aside in two days.
The army and police are angry the government has employed mercenaries to help the armed forces subdue seccessionists on Bougainville Island.
Brokers and analysts said investors feared an army mutiny and possible civil unrest in the capital Port Moresby would spread to the remote areas where most of PNG's huge gold mines and oil projects are located.  
""The danger is if any local tribes use this dispute as an excuse to act up and this would affect local mining operations,"" said Shaw Stockbroking research director Michael Heffernan.
Major mining projects in Papua New Guinea's rugged hinterlands like the giant OK Tedi project, controlled by the Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd, are often in dispute with local tribal groups.
Analysts said investors' need look no further than the now-dormant copper project on Bougainville to see what happens when the central government and armed forces lose control.  
The Bougainville Copper mine was shut down in 1989 when rebellious landowners who wanted bigger returns from the project sabotaged the mine and began the current recessionist revolt.
""There's always a certain amount of civil unrest, but if the more militant groups in the regions use this as an excuse to party as it were, it could disrupt operations,"" Heffernan said.
Local brokers became increasingly pessimistic through the afternoon, moving in anticipation of an expected selloff by overseas institutional investors.  
""I don't know what the outcome of that (situation) is going to be but it seems to me to be very dismal,"" said broker Kevin Lourey of Melbourne-based brokerage, Peake Lands Kirwan.
""The international reaction to this sort of situation is usually very negative,"" said resources analyst David Walker at broker ABN AMRO Hoare Govett
""The fear is that tonight, particularly on the London exchange, where most of the resource investment in this part of the world comes fron, there will be a strong negative reaction,"" Walker said.  
The worst-affected stock in the afternoon rout was oil producer and explorer Oil Search Ltd, which fell 8.5 percent or 24 cents to A$2.60.
Bougainville Copper Ltd, which is controlled by RTZ Corp Plc-CRA Ltd fell five cents to 55 cents.
Analysts said the government's moves over next day or two would be crucial in limiting any further damage. Prime Minister Chan had yet to respond to the army ultimatum by 0820 GMT.
""The next 24 hours is crucial for the Chan government and also for the value of these investments,"" Walker said.  
""It's important that the situation becomes as clear as it can very quickly in order not only for the stability of the country, but for the value of the investments.""

4733,"The Australian government ordered a Canadian television group to reduce its stake in an Australian television network on Friday, reflecting a strengthening in Canberra's opposition to more foreign ownership of local media.
Treasurer Peter Costello ruled that Canwest Global Communications Corp, controlled by Canadian Izzy Asper, must cut its stake in the Ten television network back to its previous 57.5 percent level from its current 76 percent.
Canwest raised its stake earlier this year through associated local companies, but a government authority said the increased ownership broke foreign control rules.
Costello's ruling came as Prime Minister John Howard, in his clearest statement yet, said he did not want foreign investment in the Australian media to go any higher.
""In the media for example, which is in the news at the moment, we've made it clear we don't want foreign investment to go any higher,"" Howard said in a radio interview after meetings with major media owners in recent weeks.
The government is reviewing cross-media ownership rules set by the former Labor government which stop television station proprietors from owning a major newspaper in the same city or vice versa.
The government is expected to drop these cross-media ownership rules, allowing local television and magazine mogul Kerry Packer to launch a takeover bid for newspaper publisher John Fairfax Holdings Ltd.
Howard also said a proposal by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd to increase its Australian television holdings had collapsed because Murdoch would not give up some of his newspapers to leave his total media holdings unchanged.
But Howard's determination to block foreign investors like Izzy Asper has unleashed a fierce debate about whether he was favouring Packer in his review of media laws.
Another of Australia's major media owners, Seven Network Ltd chairman Kerry Stokes, accused Howard of having done a ""disgraceful"" deal to deliver Fairfax to Packer.
Some commentators have said Packer's support for Howard ahead of last year's election has been a factor in Howard's opposition to the cross-media rules, which he says are outdated.
""For the Prime Minister to play king-maker revisits the darkest days of the Labor Party's deal-making with its mates,"" Stokes told Reuters.
Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke was seen as close to Packer during the 1980s, before his successor Paul Keating fell out with Packer ahead of his 1996 election rout.
""He (Howard) has made a commitment...done a deal with Packer. There's no other reason for the change,"" Stokes said, commenting on an Australian Financial Review article which said Howard planned to arrange for Murdoch to support a Packer takeover of Fairfax.
A clearly stung Howard rejected Stokes' claim.
""I reject completely any suggestion of a deal as a silly, erroneous and quite dishonourable claim,"" Howard told a news conference in Sydney.
""I'm on the record over a period of 10 years as being opposed to the cross-media restrictions,"" Howard said, pointing out his views preceded Packer's support for him in 1996.

4739,"Building materials and energy group Boral Ltd reported a lower net profit for the first half year on Wednesday, but said it was poised to take advantage of a long awaited upturn in the house building sector.
""The building materials division is now in a position to exploit the upturn,"" Boral managing director Tony Berg told reporters after announcing the profit fall.
""The upturn will bring profit leverage from improved margins and price improvements and further leverage will come from lowering costs,"" Berg said.  
Earlier, Boral reported a A$93.16 million net profit for the six months to December 31, down from A$169.71 million in the same period a year earlier. This was due in large part to a A$49.5 million abnormal profit booked from an asset sale in the previous comparable period.
Net profit pre-abnormals fell to A$96 million from A$120 million the previous year and compared with market expectations for a pre-abnormals net of about A$90 million.
Analysts said the result was a touch above expectations, largely because of a much stronger result from Boral's U.S. building materials operations.

4763,"Chinese interest in soymeal imports has tapered in the wake of a rally that has pushed prices above US$320 a tonne C&amp;F, traders said on Tuesday.
""There's no business above $300 (a tonne),"" a trader in Singapore said.
""Everyone is lurking at $300,"" said another trader in the region. ""If anyone is buying at $320, I want to find them.""  
Reports that China had bought Indian meal for September shipment at $323 a tonne, inclusive of cargo and freight, and further for November/December shipment at around $313 a tonne were greeted with ridicule throughout the region.
Trading sources said China was staying out of the market, and that Indian meal was currently overvalued by a good $20 a tonne.
Traders gave the market a couple of weeks before prices came back to more ""reasonable"" levels and the Chinese resume buying.  
""The rally in India has been happening for the past couple of weeks and the market has just jumped up. Prior to that India was undervalued,"" another trader said.
Chinese buying halted around two weeks ago, the traders said, and domestic prices had remained firm.
Meal prices at Chinese ports were around 3,000 yuan ($361) a tonne, the Singapore trader said.
Traders throughout the Far East have told Reuters they expect China to import between one million and 1.2 million tonnes of soymeal in 1996.  
One trader said last week that 600,000 tonnes of soymeal was expected to arrive in China by mid-September.
Chinese demand for animal feed -- a principal component of which is soymeal -- was down by five to seven percent in the southern regions, a veteran trader in Hong Kong said.
Another source, however, said this did not correlate with an apparent rise in Chinese meat production of 15 percent so far this year, or with the relative stability of domestic meal and corn prices.
""There is reasonable (feed) demand,"" he said.  
Meanwhile, the Chinese government has yet to issue vegetable oil import quotas and licences -- though traders reported that permission was granted for three trading firms to bring in a total of 100,000 tonnes of liquid oil in mid-August.
The veteran in Hong Kong said the wait for quotas was frustrating traders who knew China was still flush with vegetable oil -- some saying current stocks could last through to the end of 1996.  
""The trading companies are long on oil, the state, Cofco (China National Cereals, oils and Foodstuffs Import Export Corp), the crushers -- everyone is long on oil,"" another trader said.
""Domestic oil prices are being forced up, and they are trying to clear heavy stocks,"" the Hong Kong source said.
Soybean oil prices in northern China have been under some pressure recently -- movements reported by the National Grains and Oils Information Centre in Shanghai show a range since early August between 7,200 and 7,800 yuan per tonne.  
""We are hoping that in a couple of months we will see some action as the stocks clear,"" the Hong Kong source said.
Some traders were putting oil in bonded warehouses against the issue of the licences, which usually happens well before the end of August, he said.
Customs figures reported from Beijing on Tuesday show total soyoil imports from January to July 1996 were 919,140 tonnes, with 188,626 tonnes in July alone, and 72.2 percent of the total from Brazil.

4764,"China's beer and beverage market has such enormous potential that aluminium can makers already have installed capacity in the country which is double their currents needs, an industry executive in Hong Kong said.
By the turn of the millenium, China's two-piece aluminium beverage can requirments could hit eight billion cans a year, Terry Cartwright, managing director of Crown Can Hong Kong Ltd, said in a recent interview.  
""If we look at the market in round numbers, the market is about five billion (aluminium cans a year),"" Cartwright said. Installed capacity in China and Hong Kong -- which feeds the mainland market -- is now about 10 billion cans a year, he said.
By 1997, Crown Can's four plants in China and one in Hong Kong will give the company one quarter of the world's fastest growing beverage can market, with a capacity of 2.5 billion cans a year, he said.
""We're very confident about the (Chinese) market, obviously there is huge potential there,"" Cartwright said.  
""The market is growing and is growing quite well, and certainly the demand will catch up with can supply.""
Average annual consumption in China had grown from 4.2 billion cans a year in 1995, to an expected five billion this year, he said.
""The increase in the beverage market has been 25 percent in the past year,"" Cartwright told Reuters.
""Whether that will continue is a very hard call. We are predicting a total market of about 8.5 billion (cans used annually) by 1999.""  
By then, he added, installed production capacity for the China market should have reached 15 billion cans a year.
Cartwright's forecast would imply a rise in Chinese refined aluminium demand for beverage can production to about 140,000 tonnes by 1999 compared with roughly 85,000 tonnes now.
Can capacity expansion will continue until the end of 1996, Cartwright said, as manufacturers race to import necessary capital equipment before taxes of up to 50 percent are imposed.
The Chinese government cancelled tax concessions on capital equipment imports on April 1 this year, he said. The grace period lasts until the end of the year.  
""Obviously all the major can manufacturers want to become established in the Chinese market because the potential is huge,"" he said.
""So can manufacturers that wanted to become established have also wanted to ensure they put capacity in prior to the end of the duty concession period.
""There has been a big expansion over the last couple of years and it will continue to grow because capacity that has been installed now will be commissioned this year or next year,"" he said.  
Consumption of canned beverages in China still impressively trails that of Western countries -- consumption in the United States, for example, is around 300 cans per capita a year compared to China's four per capita.
China's beer market, however, is expected to overtake that of the United States by 2000, Cartwright said, to become the world's biggest.
China's 1995 per capita beer consumption was 12 litres (21 pints), just one-eighth of the U.S. figure, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.  
Beer production figures for 1995 have variously been reported by official Chinese sources as 15.46 million and 21.4 million tonnes.
Xinhua has also said China's 1.2 billion people would be drinking 30 million tonnes of beer by 2000.
These sort of figures, no matter how flexible Chinese reporting might be, augur well for the can makers.
""At the moment, the beer market is dominated by returnable bottles, but cans are gaining market share quite significantly,"" Cartwright said.  
""So obviously as the market develops and cans become more predominant, then the potential for the market is huge.""

4775,"China is unlikely to need to buy rice on the international market to make up for flood damage to domestic crops, Far East traders said on Tuesday.
No China inquiries for rice were reported by traders in China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Thailand.
""As far as large demand from the (central grain) reserve, COFCO (China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import Export Corp) or the grain bureaux goes, I rule it out,"" said a Chinese trader in Shanghai.  
China's Futures Herald newspaper, quoting State Grain Reserve Administration statistics, said on Saturday that although flood damage had reduced the early rice harvest and was likely to slow planting of late rice, total output for 1996 was expected to be unaffected.
This is because China has increased the area under rice cultivation this year, the newspaper said, adding that the reduction in the early harvest should not have a significant effect on the total grain harvest due to higher production of other crops, it said.  
Rice imports could not go ahead without central government approval, and the process of issuing quotas and licences could take weeks or even months, trading sources said.
The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said at the weekend that flooding in Hunan, one of China's major rice-growing provinces, had prevented farmers from planting rice for the autumn harvest and could force them to depend on food aid until next summer.  
""Many farmers lost the season's first crop of rice in the floods and were unable to plant for the second harvest, leaving them dependent on food aid until their next crop, in one year's time,"" said Thorir Gudmundsson.
""For the second crop, they need to plant in July, and it is now mid-August,"" he said.
The notion that China might need to import rice to meet demand provided some underlying support to rice futures prices on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) on Monday.
The CBOT September price closed up 5-1/2 U.S. cents per cwt at $10.16.  
Chicago rice futures have been underpinned by a recent U.S. report that China bought 20,000 tonnes of Vietnamese white rice for prompt July shipments and that additional purchases were expected.
But very little movement in domestic Chinese rice prices has been seen over the past three months, traders said.
""To be convinced that China will buy some rice, I have to get confirmation from the market -- but so far the market has not done anything, prices are steady,"" one Asian trader said.  
Traders in China quoted domestic prices at 2,200-2,300 yuan ($265-$277) a tonne for low quality long grain rice; 2,600-2,700 yuan ($313-$325) for high quality long grain rice; up to 2,800 yuan ($337) for low quality short grain rice; and 3,000 yuan ($361) for high quality short grain rice.
More than 500 people were killed by the July floods in Hunan alone, with the national death toll from floods and typhoons surpassing 2,700, according to the government.
Applications for rice imports would have to traverse China's multi-layered bureaucracy, trading sources said, though the procedure could be speeded up in times of emergency.  
The State Planning Commission (SPC) would issue a national quota, which would then be allocated to provincial SPC offices, which would then distribute the quota to trading companies, trading sources said.
Rice, along with wheat, corn and soybeans, is considered a strategic grain and is thus tightly regulated.
Hunan grows more than 22 percent of China's total early rice crop. Losses to the rice crop in the central province have been estimated at 2.4 million tonnes, accounting for most of the 2.6 million tonnes of Hunan's total grain losses.  
About 90 percent of China's early rice crop of 50 million tonnes is grown in Hunan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces. China has three rice crops a year.
A Chinese analyst predicted earlier this month that the flooding could cut early rice output by between 10 and 20 percent. This would reduce the total 1996 rice crop by up to four percent for a total output figure of about 180 million tonnes.
China's rice production in 1995 was 179 million tonnes according to figures from the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import and Export Corp.

4778,"While he ruled China, Deng Xiaoping politely declined the worshipful personality cult that grew up around his predecessor, Chairman Mao Zedong.
With his death last Wednesday, however, the floodgates were opened for what could be the start of the ""Deng market"" as books, posters and comics featuring the patriarch swept into stores ahead of his funeral on Tuesday.
In Shanghai, China's fast-beating mercantile heart, more than 80 branches of the state-run Xinhua bookstore had taken delivery of glossy Deng posters to meet anticipated demand, the Liberation Daily said.
Thousands of sets of the pictures, entitled ""The Architect of China's Opening, Reform and Modernisation -- Deng Xiaoping"", had been flown to Shanghai from publishing houses in various parts of China, it said.
Elsewhere, the People's Daily reported that ""people old and young, men and women, including officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and young students"" had waited in line for hours in Beijing to buy Deng portraits.
The state's rush to push out Deng memorabilia follows long years during which China's 1.2 billion people rarely saw even a photo of their paramount leader.
After the excesses of Mao worship during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, Deng made a clear break in leadership style by insisting on a low public profile. On retiring from his last official post in 1991, he dropped almost completely from view.
There was a brief burst of Deng propaganda in 1992, when he successfully overruled communist hardliners and pushed his capitalist-style economic reforms to a new pitch. After that, however, Deng vanished again from the public eye.
His death at 92, however, freed Deng's heirs to make the most out of his political patronage and China's state stores and news media were ordered to begin cranking out memorials and mementoes as quickly as possible.
In one store in Shanghai, a city which has benefited greatly from Deng's reforms, biographies, collections of Deng's thoughts on socialism and economic development -- and handbooks explaining them -- were selling well.
""China has hope because of Deng Xiaoping,"" said one 73-year-old man poring over a selection of Deng's works at a bookshop on the city's premier shopping street, Nanjing Road.
He was buying a book for his grandson, he said, and had chosen ""Xiaoping Says -- What is Socialism"", which for 7.60 yuan ($0.91) uses simple cartoons to explain Deng's theories.
""He was the greatest leader China ever had,"" the man said.
""Look at what he did -- he brought the country out of chaos, he came up with the 'one country, two systems' theory for the return of Hong Kong, and he retired early. A truly great man.""

4783,"The death of Deng Xiaoping is unlikely to shake the so-called Shanghai Gang of technocrats allied to President Jiang Zemin, analysts said on Friday.
They said the group could rely on Jiang's continued patronage, in part because of the talent of its members.
""Shanghai is a pretty important place, therefore you'd expect people who have made it up to a certain level there to move on up,"" said a Western diplomat.
Shanghai, China's biggest city and its economic heart, represents the success of Deng's forward-looking policy of integrating the country's economy with the rest of the world.
The city attracts a major share of China's foreign investment and many analysts see Shanghai moving to regain its 1930s mantle as Asia's most important financial and cultural centre.
Most high-profile of the Shanghai's stars are economic tsar, vice-premier Zhu Rongji and fellow vice-premier Wu Bangguo.
Political pundits in the city are looking for signs of who will be the next to join the club of former Shanghai officials to heed Jiang's call to join him in Beijing.
Officials say privately that both Shanghai Mayor Xu Kuangdi and local Communist Party chief Huang Ju are heading for senior posts in the capital later this year.
One official said he expected Huang to be given a role in the party discipline area while Xu would take a job dealing with the economy.
Current vice-mayor Chen Liangyu is seen as the most likely successor to the mayor, while analysts in Shanghai lean towards the view that Huang will be replaced by someone from outside Shanghai.
The central government wants to keep a steady rotation of officials from different regions to prevent the local administration becoming too independent, analysts said.
Past and recent movements of senior Communist Party officials from Shanghai to senior posts in the central government have long been viewed as attempts by President Jiang to tighten his grip on power.
But many of those in the loosely knit group are not Shanghai natives. Jiang, for instance, was not born in Shanghai, though he cut his political teeth here.
""The people he is going to feel most comfortable having around him are the people he worked with,"" said an analyst.
But their abilities in the task of running a modern government are probably even more valuable, the analysts said.
Shanghainese are perceived as competent administrators and canny business people.
""The Shanghainese do have a reputation for being very skillful at administration and business,"" said a Shanghai-based diplomat.
""And that's where China is right now -- they need competant people, people with management experience. And the management experience in Shanghai is one which is needed in the centre,"" he said.
The move late last year to Beijing of Shanghai's vice mayor in charge of the economy Hua Jianming fitted into this pattern, analysts said.
Hua was widely respected for his management and administrative skills, said an Asian diplomat, ""and he was brought into the centre to use those skills"".
""The Shanghainese clique are simply very expeditious at implementing other people's vision because, essentially, they are technocrats and that's what China needs,"" said a Western analyst.

4784,"Copper and zinc were the main focus of attention for Far East metal traders on Monday, though China's exit from the market to celebrate the arrival of the Year of the Ox left a gaping hole in trading activity.
China has closed down to celebrate the arrival of the new lunar year. Most Chinese markets will be closed until February 17, though trading activity should start to pick up mid-week.
A slight fundamental tightness in copper supply was seen throughout the region, a trader in Singapore told Reuters, adding that it was not being helped by high cash prices.
""Even in mainland China we understand people are having difficulty in obtaining metal,"" he said. ""Obviously the high cash price is somewhat of a deterrent but if they need physical metal they just have to buy it.""
Three months copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) ended the Friday afternoon kerb at $2,239 a tonne, after profit-taking trimmed $18 off Thursday's closing price.
Physical demand for copper in China for 1997 is expected to exceed supply by around 100,000 tonnes.
Chinese media reported last month that China's 1997 copper demand should rise five percent over last year to 1.05 million tonnes. Output is expected to be more than 900,000 tonnes, after 1996's 909,700 tonnes, Market Daily said.
Copper imports were expected to remain high, the newspaper said. Imports of raw and uncast copper in 1996 were up 32.7 percent in 1996 to 714,248 tonnes.
The few trading sources available on Monday said end-users of the red metal in Asia were buying hand-to-mouth, but there was as yet no element of panic-buying.
""If you start to see some significant increase in demand, then I think that's where the market will have some interest via higher prices,"" one trader said.
Zinc enters the Year of the Ox as a bull for Asian traders, some of whom thought recent rallies that have seen LME prices touch two-year highs could be more in anticipation of upcoming tightness than a reflection of current fundamentals.
LME zinc hit a fresh two-year high of $1,196 a tonne in early Friday trading, ending the day $3 easier at $1,183 a tonne.
What one Asian trader described as ""the magical and psychological level"" of $1,200 a tonne is the metal's next test, followed by the January 1995 peak of $1,239.
Traders' optimism that current price levels would consolidate before true tightness hit the market in the second half of 1997 were being fuelled by this year's shortfall in global supply of up to 250,000 tonnes, they said.
Lack of Chinese activity in the zinc market during the holiday period was not seen by trading sources as impacting on price movements one way or the other.
But word that Chinese producers had already moved 20,000 tonnes of zinc to Singapore warehouses, and that another 30,000 to 40,000 tonnes was on the way, was indicative of their selling interest, traders said.
""I'm not sure that there is any interest in immediately selling it but they (Chinese producers) are moving it very close to a market where they can sell it, deliver it and get cash in two days,"" another Singapore source said.
Chinese metal producers often moved their product to Singapore, keeping it off-warrant so it does not show up in LME stock reports but where it can be used as collateral, he said.
If the market remained strong, Chinese zinc could stay put as producers waited for prices to rise even further, he said.
""If they hold off on the anticipation of higher prices, it is just a gamble, and how quickly they sell into a retracement is difficult to know -- but they certainly don't appear to be overly concerned at present,"" he said.

4787,"Australia's Prime Minister arrives in China on Friday to redefine Canberra as a friend of Beijing, which less than a year ago accused Australia of being party to U.S. attempts to contain China, business sources said.
John Howard wants to let China know that the business of Australia is business, said Bruce Dover, general manager of PDN-Xinren Information Technology Co, a joint venture of media giant News Corp and Chinese Communist Party newspaper People's Daily providing online computer technology information.
""I think the Chinese have made it clear that if you want to do business, then business becomes the business of government and that should be the priority,"" Dover said.
Sino-Australian relations, warm throughout the 13-year reign of the Australian Labour Party, started to chill once Howard's Liberal Party took over from Labour in elections in March 1996.
The relationship began to sour soon after the elections with the cancellation of a financial support scheme for Australian business in developing countries followed in September by a visit to Australia by Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama.
The nadir came in August 1996 when China accused Australia of moving too close to the United States, after U.S. Secretary of Defence William Perry described Japan and Australia as the northern and southern anchors of Washington's Asian security arrangements.
""From this we can see that the United States is really thinking about using these two 'anchors' as the claws of a crab,"" the official People's Daily said in an editorial.
Australia's trade commissioner in Shanghai, Richard Pillow, said he saw no impact from the political issues on Australia's booming trade with China -- Australian exports to China grew 24 percent in 1996 to A$3.896 billion ($3 billion).
""Howard's visit is a proactive move to strengthen bilateral ties,"" Pillow said, adding that Australian companies were on a long list of international firms wanting a slice of the Chinese pie.
Howard arrives in Shanghai, China's biggest city and its mercantile heart, on Friday evening with a business delegation that includes representatives of Australian banks, insurance firms and commodity trading bodies.
A number of deals expected to be announced during the trip, including the opening in Beijing of a branch of ANZ Bank, business sources said.
In the lead-up to his five-day China trip, Howard emphasised the importance of Canberra's relationship with Beijing and of Australia's place in Asia, and said the level of the business delegation with him reflected this.
""It is probably the most senior and most broadly based representative business group to accompany an Australian prime minister on an overseas trip,"" he said.
In 1996, Australia's imports from China were worth A$4.122 billion, up from A$3.861 billion the year before, Australian officials said.

4791,"China, currently importing about 100,000 tonnes of soybean oil a month, could step up imports as traders move away from palm oil and new licences to import soybean oil become available, Asian traders said on Wednesday.
While Chinese markets are seen flush with oil at the moment, traders said most of the available vegetable oil is palm, which is now selling at a hefty premium to soybean oil.
Palm oil is costing $596 a tonne FOB (free on board) at Malaysian ports, a Singapore trading source said. He said freight charges added a further $25 per tonne. This would put the c&amp;f (cost and freight) price on arrival in China at $621 a tonne.
In comparison, South American soybean oil is arriving in China at about $560 a tonne c&amp;f, he said, adding ""It's a big spread.""
""People are clamouring for (soybean oil) import licences now,"" another regional trader told Reuters.
China on Monday purchased a total of 35,000 tonnes of U.S. soybean oil for February shipment, U.S. exporters in Chicago said.  
One position for 25,000 tonnes was slated for shipment from the U.S. Gulf for around $512 per tonne FOB, the other 10,000 tonnes for shipment from Norfolk at $510 a tonne FOB.
U.S. exporters say China has been seen actively buying South American vegetable oil. They estimated purchases at around 50,000 to 60,000 tonnes of Brazilian and Argentinian product.
China's total 1996 soybean oil imports were 1.3 million tonnes, with imports in December alone at 91,000 tonnes.
January and February import figures are expected to show a dip because of Western and Chinese holidays, traders said, adding it would probably be made up in the second quarter of 1997.
Western and Chinese traders have said they do not understand how the government administers the import licencing system given that permits were issued for only 600,000 to 700,000 tonnes of the 1.3 million tonnes of soybean oil imported in 1996.
Soybean oil imported without a licence is subject to import duty of 120 percent, compared to licenced imports which are subject to a 13 percent import duty and 13 percent value-added tax (VAT) on top of that.  
Fears of an official crackdown on soybean oil arriving without permits arose last week on news that one 20,000-tonne cargo of U.S. oil had been held up at a Chinese port.
A trader involved in the sale told Reuters at the time the huge gap between China's domestic price and the international price could see Chinese importers placing orders without the necessary import licences.
South American and U.S. soybean oil, once refined, is costing around 6,600 yuan ($795) a tonne, compared to 7,200 to 7,300 yuan ($867-879) per tonne for the domestic product.
However, traders said soybean import licences are now being made available on a regular basis and the 20,000-tonne cargo had been discharged.

4793,"World zinc prices that have risen to levels not seen for more than four years are good for Chinese zinc producers who will gear up output to take advantage of the hikes, producing and trading sources said on Tuesday.
While many Chinese producers have sold out of their metal, output would be boosted from April, said a source at the Zhuzhou smelter, one of China's major producers in Hunan province.
Zhuzhou's exports for the first three months of 1997 would hit 20,000 tonnes, more than for the same period of 1996, he said, though he had no comparative figure.
As with most producers, Zhuzhou had been moving its metal to Japan to take advantage of Tokyo's general system of preferences (GSP) policy that exempts developing country imports from tariffs if they are submitted for customs clearance before the beginning of the fiscal year on April 1, the source said.
""This is on long-term contracts, and you can say we're pretty well sold out,"" the source said.
This knowledge has led some Western industry sources to question just how quickly the Chinese could take advantage of the current price rally.
Trading sources said significant tonnages of Chinese zinc had been delivered to warehouses in Singapore, where it is used as collateral for loans but also is available for sales on price rises.
Talk among traders has put the amount stored Singapore at up to 75,000 tonnes, but this could not be confirmed with Chinese or Western sources.
The worldwide Zinc supply is expected to become tight in the second half of 1997. One Western producer representative said his company was sold out for the second half and he saw world prices climbing another $100 a tonne before the end of the year.
""This situation really does seem good for China,"" the Zhuzhou source said.
Zinc prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME) ploughed through a 4-1/2-year high on Monday after a sizeable fall in stocks announced last Friday.
The market touched $1,304 a tonne before settling $6 a tonne up on the day at $1,296. The metal at 0200 GMT was being quoted just a shade under $1,300 at $1,294/99 a tonne.
Premiums have begun to soften on the back of the firming prices. One representative of a North American producer said Chinese traders were quoting premiums on a cost and freight (c&amp;f) at $65 a tonne at Chinese ports.
A Chinese trader in Hong Kong, who sells registered and unregistered zinc on behalf of southern Chinese producers, said he was quoting premiums over the LME cash price basis Chinese ports at $70-80 a tonne. He said $60 would be the bottom level.
A Western trader in Singapore said Chinese smelters had sold forward, leaving domestic supply tight. Chinese trading sources agreed that metal in China is now in tight supply.
Firm domestic prices of around 10,500 yuan ($1,265) a tonne were indicative of the tightness, the Zhuzhou source said, ""but the domestic market just isn't that big"".
Some sources in China have said they think 1997 will be a historic year for Chinese zinc exports, with one local trader putting China's total for the year at half a million tonnes, with up to 80,000 tonnes done in January and February alone.
Official China customs figures show China's exports of unwrought zinc and zinc alloys in January 1997 reached 30,914 tonnes, up 100.3 percent compared to the year-ago period.
China exported 226,777 tonnes of unwrought zinc and zinc alloys in 1996, up 18.4 percent on 1995, the figures show.

4799,"Sugar producers in China are worried that a flood of imports could swamp the domestic market and drive down prices already below break-even point, industry and trade sources said on Wednesday.
White sugar prices in China's southern production belt of Guangxi province are still below 4,000 yuan ($481) per tonne, in some places dipping to 3,700 yuan ($445), traders and industry sources in China and Hong Kong told Reuters.
Break-even point was above 4,000 yuan per tonne, and prices ideally should be up to 4,200 to 4,300 yuan per tonne for the factories to make any money, a senior industry executive said.
Official Chinese media reported last week that China planned to import 690,000 tonnes of sugar in 1997.
Of that amount, 350,000 tonnes would come from Cuba, where, according to German statistician F.O. Licht, the 1996/97 sugar crop should be close to the forecast of 4.5 million tonnes.
The remainder of China's 1997 imports would come from Thailand and Australia, traders said.
Official customs figures show total 1996 sugar imports were 1.25 million tonnes, 57.5 percent down on the previous year.
One Hong Kong-based sugar trader said China's 1997 sugar imports would probably be closer to 1.5 million tonnes.
""The country has 1.2 billion people, they can consume as much as you put in there,"" he said.
A Hong Kong-based executive responsible for several sugar facilities in southern China, however, said that unless the Chinese government controlled the way in which the imported sugar reached the market, prices could be expected to worsen.
""It is a question of when the imports come in and how they are released on to the market,"" he said on condition of anonymity.
""If it is tightly controlled and it trickles on to the market, it would be OK,"" he said.
He said the experience of 1995 would hopefully have shown authorities the effect on the domestic industry of sudden and large injections of sugar on to the market.
That year, sugar imports hit 2.95 million tonnes, 90.3 percent more than the year before. Much of the imports were illegal, prices plummeted and many factories are still trying to recover.
The sugar cane crop in southern China is now being harvested, and white sugar prices are expected to keep softening until the crop is all in, around late March/early April.
China's officially-stated 1996/97 sugar production target has varied over the past few months, in one case going over eight million tonnes. Traders in the region have tended to put more store in an earlier figure of 6.53 million tonnes.
China's annual demand is around eight million tonnes.
Once the harvest is through, market prices should begin to improve, giving factories a chance to drag themselves out of the red and repay loans taken out to pay farmers for their cane, an industry executive said.
Factories have complained that the price they must pay farmers for cane is too high given the low market price for the processed product.
This year's cane price has been set at 230 to 300 yuan ($27-36) per tonne, about the same as last season, though that was a 65 percent increase on the 1994 set price. Ten tonnes of cane produces one tonne of white sugar.
""All the factories are strapped for cash to pay farmers for the cane, and so are selling whatever they can get just to bring some money in,"" the executive said.
""While there is an overhang of volume there will be pressure on prices, and introducing another 700,000 tonnes will just add another element on top of that.""
Like the factory manager, he was cautiously optimistic that China's authorities had indeed learnt from 1995.
""Calculations we've done on the back of an envelope suggest that 600,000 to 700,000 tonnes will not result in oversupply,"" he said.
But he added that if imports did go as high as some traders predicted, ""things will be quite serious"".

4800,"The British government warned on Friday it would refer the proposed transatlantic alliance between British Airways Plc and American Airlines to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission unless the carriers accepted a number of conditions.
Trade and Industry Secretary Ian Lang added that even if the conditions are met by both airlines, final clearance will hinge on an open skies deal being signed between the British and U.S. governments to liberalise transatlantic air traffic -- securing greater competition on the routes.
Lang backed conditions proposed by competition watchdog, the Office of Fair Trading, which was asked to re-examine the case last month.
He said in a statement, ""I agree...that without suitable undertakings the alliance would be likely to lead to a significant loss of actual and potential passengers, on those routes where BA and AA (American) currently compete and for all passengers on the transatlantic route between the UK and U.S.""
The comments came just minutes after the latest set of open skies talks ended in London, with no deal signed. Industry sources said there was no new date for fresh talks and blamed the deadlock on uncertainty over whether the BA/American deal would be cleared.
Both BA and American were both forming a response to the news and were unavailable to give an immmediate reaction.
The conditions for clearance of the alliance are that BA and American drop 168 slots at London Heathrow airport, the busiest in Europe.
The government also wants BA to drop a clause in its agreement with USAir which bars it from competing on transatlantic routes.
Also, both BA and American should be prepared to reduce services on the London to Dallas Ft Worth route in the event that a new entrant wishes to enter, because it was felt by the OFT that competition on this route would be hampered by an alliance.
The OFT has called for BA/American to allow third party access to their joint frequent flyer programme where the applicant does not have access to an equivalent scheme.
Lang said responses should be made to the OFT by 1700 GMT on January 10 1997.
But Will Whitehorn, spokesman for Virgin Atlantic Airways, a major rival on the UK-U.S. route, said ""I don't think they will be able to meet these conditions. I think it will go to the MMC...even if they complied with the conditions the alliance would still be anti-competitive.""
On the open skies talks, Whitehorn said that by linking the deal's clearance to an open skies pact, the British government was using its leverage to try and gain reciprocal access for British carriers into the restricted U.S. internal market.
United Airlines said it thought the OFT conditions imposed on the alliance were in step with its own views.
The current aviation agreement, dating back to March 1991, restricts transatlantic access to Heathrow to BA, American, Virgin Atlantic Airways and United Airlines.
The DOT has refused to comment on whether it will now be seeking to set a date for new open skies talks bearing in mind the OFT stipulation that alliance clearance hinges on transatlantic flight liberalisation.
Under the BA/American alliance, BA would coordinate its 244 flights a week to 22 U.S. destinations with American's 238 flights from seven U.S. airports to 12 European destinations.

4807,"Tomkins Plc, the UK conglomerate with businesses spanning baking to engineering, is expected to sees a rise in half year pretax profits on Monday amid some market speculation that it could announce a share buyback.
Analysts were mostly predicting six month profits of around 160 million stg from 126.1 million in the previous year. The average forecast for the half year payout was 3.0 pence per share from 2.70 pence last time.  
The shares have recently seen brisk gains following a ""buy"" recommendation from Kleinwort Benson analysts. Tomkins was also listed as one of the nine stocks to buy in 1997 by Credit Lyonnais Laing. Shares are currently at 278 pence, down two pence.
Another reason for Tomkins' recent gains has been some market speculation about a possible share buyback. The group board obtained permission for a buyback of up to 10 percent of its shares in 1995 and currently has around 400 million stg in cash.  
But Ian Rennardson, analyst at Credit Lyonnais, said the group had given no indications since that it may launch a buyback at the interim stage. Other analysts are also sceptical.
Rennardson sees interim profits at 160 million stg and expects a solid trading performance. ""This is a stock within a sector which has seen real underperformance. Tomkins has the best earnings, dividends and cashflow and after the Gates (Corp) deal, the shares are still looking reasonably cheap.""
Another analyst, predicting the same profit levels, said investors would be looking for an update on Gates since its acquisition last summer for $1 bln.  
Gates is an automotive and components company.
Sterling is not expected to deal a blow to the Tomkins results this time round, said one analyst.  ""Sterling will in fact benefit the year ending April 1997 as Tomkins has locked in (foreign exchange cover) at $1.52 to the pound,"" he said.
He anticipates a solid U.S. performance, with a slightly subdued UK market and continued good cash generation.

4819,"CE Electric, the U.S. utility giant in the throes of a hostile takeover battle for Northern Electric Plc, said on Friday it was confident of winning and claimed it had several institutional investors behind it.
Speaking just after the UK government had given clearance to a takeover deal, David Sokol, chairman and chief executive of the U.S. group, said: ""I believe investors will now back the offer, they have seen it cleared and there is no white knight (bidder) on the horizon. We are now confident of getting above the 50 percent threshold,"" needed to clinch the deal.  
Sokol said he had spoken to a number of big invetors who indicated privately they would back the 650p per share offer. ""They think that 650 pence is a very full price."" So far, Northern has 30 percent of Northern shares in the bag and acceptances for four percent. The U.S. utility chief was unfazed by reports in the press that major shareholder Prudential Corp Plc, which holds over 11 percent, was going to back the Northern Board.
Northern confirmed in a statement that Prudential had bought extra shares at 600 pence per share.
But Sokol said the ""economics of the bid are compelling.""  
""You just have to look at the facts,"" he said. ""The stock was at 495 pence per share before we came in with our (first) bid (at 630 pence per share).
""The stock will plummet if it's not accepted. Add to that the fact that the FTSE 100 index is looking at a correction. Here is an opportunity to take a very large profit, cash in the bank and add to that factor that Northern's proposal does not offer value.""

4823,"Britain's building sector has finally shaken off one of its nastiest ailments, with strong evidence that the long and painful decline in the domestic housing market is now over and sales are on the up again.
But celebrations failed to break out across the sector.
Housebuilders may be set to reap the rewards of the recovery, but some of the biggest companies in the building industry on Friday continued to suffer from other afflictions.
Building material giants like RMC Plc, Redland Plc and BPB saw their shares slide heavily on Friday due to continued problems in the key German market plus the pound's relentless rise against the mark and dollar which is eating into valuable export revenues.
RMC ended 36p lower at 903.5. Redland closed 5.5p weaker at 330, BPB 13p off 362.5p and Blue Circle 7.5p off at 368.
Optimistic reports of British housing starts at a seven-year high and earlier predictions of 1997 house price inflation of up to 10 percent were overshadowed by concerns about a continued deterioration in German GDP and higher unemployment.
For these big building materials firms, analysts say the impact of Germany -- accounting for up to 40 percent of profits -- far outweighs the small upside from the British house sector.
The second negative is the 10 percent appreciation in the pound against the mark over the last few months. Companies like Redland have already fired a warning signal on sterling's potential impact on profits.
UBS building analyst Simon Brown summed up the gloom: ""Only a tiny proportion of the building material sector's business is in the UK. As a total of construction output, UK housing was 14 percent in 1995.""
Looking at one of the biggest players in the sector, RMC, Brown said: ""Less than 20 percent of RMC's profit comes from the UK and an even smaller part from UK housing. So it is a tiny proportion of overall earnings.""
Downgrades have haunted companies exposed to Germany and the pound. But one player which has escaped the pessimism and is tipped as a ""buy"" in light of the housing recovery is Caradon.
Caradon is seen as the recovery stock, having slashed around 75 million pounds ($126 million) from costs in the last two years and rationalised its portfolio of businesses.
Its profits are seen rising sharply this year and next. It has sizeable exposure to the British housing market, through its double glazing window and shower product range. It can also cash in on demand for building material supplies from Britain.
""It has the highest proportion of output linked to UK housing,"" said UBS' analyst Brown. ""Hepworth and Marley could also be worth a play,"" he said.
Howard Seymour, an analyst at brokers BZW, said in a note that he recommended buying Tarmac and Redland -- but that building material firm BPB was classed a ""sell"".
""We argue that the sector is displaying late cycle characteristics as speculative supply is following demand which gives a robust profile to recovery over 1997.""
He said that expected rises in British interest rates this year would ""take a back seat to profit recovery. Accordingly, investors should view the UK as their first choice for building materials investment over the next 12 months.""
The main beneficiaries of the house market rebound will be housebuilder specialists. ""Those which were best at buying land will be the most serious winners - Berkeley, Persimmon, Barratt and Beazer,"" said Brown. ($1=.5950 Pound)

4828,"Britain cleared U.S. utility CE Electric's 782 million pound ($1.29 billion) hostile takeover bid for Northern Electric on Friday, just days ahead of a final deadline for shareholders to accept the offer.
Removing the first hurdle to the deal, trade and industry minister Ian Lang said in a statement: ""CE Electric has given me assurances to address the regulatory concerns...These include assurances relating to Northern's financial and management resources and to maintaining Northern's financial status.""
The 650 pence-per-share bid, which electricity supply group Northern has said ""short changes"" investors, closes next Friday.
Northern says it has the backing of major investor Prudential Corporation, which owns more than 11 percent of its shares and has bought more at 600 pence apiece.
Prudential traditionally tends to back the target company's board in a hostile takeover situation. But in the latest war of words, CE Electric said it also had major investors on its side and was confident of victory.
""I believe investors will now back the offer. They have seen it cleared and there is no white knight (bidder) on the horizon. We are now confident of getting above the 50 percent threshold,"" said David Sokol, CE Electric's chairman and chief executive.
""The decision for shareholders is now crystal clear. You just have to look at the facts. The stock was at 495 pence per share before we came in with our (first) bid (at 630 pence).
""The stock will plummet if it's not accepted. Add to that the fact that the FTSE 100 index is looking at a correction. Here is an opportunity to take a very large profit, cash in the bank.""
Northern shares were up sharply on news of the deal being cleared, rising 41 pence to 643.50. The British utility's share price had been sluggish in recent sessions on fears that the deal could be blocked.
But Northern's latest rebuttal said acceptance would mean shareholders ""giving up almost one pound per share in dividends over the next nine months and to forego a prospective 1997/98 yield of over 10.5 percent.""
Northern's defence has said it is worth more than 650 pence a share, with some analysts saying it is holding out for 700 pence.
The electricity firm has outlined plans to realise value by merging its electricity and gas supply businesses with another regional player. It also wants to develop a 50 megawatt gas-fired power station in a joint venture with Rolls Royce .
Everything now hangs on next Friday, with both sides keeping up the campaign to clinch support from big investors.
CE Electric has 30 percent of shares in the bag and four percent of acceptances, needing 50 percent of Northern shares to win.
Northern had already escaped the clutches of one predator -- conglomerate Trafalgar House -- last year. The electricity group won the day with a 560 million pound defence package.
But the package -- awash with cash -- prompted the electricity regulator to take a closer look at bumper industry profits, resulting in tougher price controls which wiped billions of pounds off shares in the sector. ($1=.6043 Pound)

4841,"Embattled Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel Plc assured investors on Monday that the financial fallout from last November's fire would not hit its debt rescue plan or derail long-term growth.
""The board...believes that the November fire should not have any significant effect on the long-term financial performance of the company, nor will there be any need to review the financial restructuring plan,"" said Eurotunnel in a statement.
The blaze swept through one of the cross-channel tunnels, causing a partial shutdown and reduced services. But Eurotunnel gave evidence that sales had survived the fire, with passenger numbers sharply up and the outlook for 1997 encouraging.
Richard Hannah, analyst at UBS, said: ""The fact that the refinancing will not have to be restructured is the key message for investors.""
A special shareholder meeting had been due in April to consider the debt refinancing, which was clinched in October. But Eurotunnel said it had now delayed that to June when full services would resume once tunnel repairs had been completed.
Eurotunnel said its banking syndicate had used the delay to ask the remaining syndicate of bankers to extend the debt standstill arrangement to December. It began in September 1995 and runs for 18 months.
Eurotunnel chairman Patrick Ponsolle also said he hoped to agree details of the debt deal with its steering group of banks before March. Ponsolle was speaking to Reuters before a news briefing on the year's outlook in Folkestone, England.
In the first major trading review since the fire, Eurotunnel reported that unaudited estimated turnover for 1996 was 450 million pounds ($752.5 million), up from 300 million in 1995.
The group said the sales growth was achieved ""despite a substantial loss of revenue in the last seven weeks (of 1996)"".
Thirteen million passengers travelled through the tunnel last year by the Le Shuttle car service or the Eurostar passenger trains, up from eight million the previous year.
The board described the outlook for 1997 as encouraging as the cross-channel ferry industry was cutting capacity in a move which holds out the prospect of firmer pricing.
Eurotunnel believes that once full services resume by June it should be able to raise its market share in the second half.
""This market share should be comparable to, if not higher than, autumn 1996, and revenues at the end of this year should be higher than at the end of 1996,"" it said.
""As expected, Eurotunnel has provided a morale booster,"" said Hannah. Growth in sales was in line with expectations. Passenger numbers had been expected to increase after a change of ownership in the Eurostar passenger train service last April.
It was taken over by London and Continental Railways with the aim of raising sales dramatically.
Looking at a breakdown of the latest Eurotunnel traffic data, Eurostar increased passenger numbers by 67 percent to 4.86 million for the full year, and by 69 percent for the 11 months up to the November fire which led to a temporary closure.
Le Shuttle car tourist traffic rose 70 percent to 2.07 million cars in 1996, with bus traffic up 148 percent to 57,692 coaches. Le Shuttle freight traffic was up 33 percent to 519,003 trucks for the year.

The hotel, casino and entertainment company has held high-level talks with Cablevision Systems Corp about acquiring its 50 percent stake in Madison Square Garden, but no deal has been struck, the sources said.
Cablevision is ""the primary potential acquirer,"" said one source close to ITT who declined to be identified.  
Although ITT has held discussions with potential buyers about the other properties, which include its profitable international telephone directories business, those talks are not in advanced stages, the sources said.

4855,"ITT Corp will have a difficult time convincing investors that a sale of its non-core assets would be more valuable than a $6.5 billion hostile bid from rival Hilton Hotels Corp, Wall Street analysts said.
Although ITT would certainly be a better-focused company without assets like Madison Square Garden and world telephone directories, the move may come too late for shareholders who have seen the stock price erode in recent months.
""It begs the question:  Why didn't they do it sooner?"" said Daniel Davila of Rodman &amp; Redshaw Inc.  
As expected, ITT earlier rejected Hilton's $6.5 billion takeover offer as inadequate and not in the best interest of shareholders.  The hotel, casino and entertainment giant will review options to increase shareholder value, including the potential sale of non-core assets.
Industry experts have estimated those assets could generate more than $2 billion that ITT could use to buy back stock or issue a special dividend to shareholders.
Meanwhile, Hilton is widely expected to raise its $55 per share offer for ITT, perhaps as much as another $10 per share.  
""If Hilton comes back with $65, I think ITT will have trouble making a strong case to its shareholders,"" said Bruce Raabe of Collins &amp; Co.
Shares of ITT jumped 1-3/4 to 57-3/4 in afternoon trading on views of a higher bid.
Analysts also said that stockholders will not want to wait for ITT to sell holdings while a Hilton offer is on the table.
Analysts and sources close to ITT have indicated the company would move quickly if it decides to sell assets and the stakes in Madison Square Garden and Alcatel Alsthom would be among the first to be sold.  
French telecommunications company Alcatel said it has been approached by ITT for permission to sell some of its five percent stake before an agreed-upon July deadline. ITT signed a shareholders agreement with Alcatel in 1992 that called for it to retain the stake until July 3.
And Cablevision, which owns the Madison Square Garden properties with ITT, reiterated that it has an excellent relationship with ITT and its chairman Rand Araskog.
Cablevision declined to comment on speculation that it would buy ITT's 50 percent of Madison Square Garden. It has rights of first refusal if ITT decides to sell the stake.  
Although the strategy may be a tough sell with shareholders, some industry experts noted that ITT's rejection was aggressive, well-planned and issued before Friday's response deadline.
""ITT has put the burden back on Hilton,"" said Bjorn Hanson of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, adding that ITT may still pursue an acquisition to stave off Hilton.
Meanwhile, Hilton had little reaction to ITT's rejection, saying only that the response does not change its plans or its intent.

NationsBank Corp. on Friday announced plans to buy Boatmen's Bancshares Inc. in a $9.5 billion transaction viewed as pricey and daring.
""This is going to cause a couple of people to go into action. Those who want to be national players recognize there are only a few opportunities out there,"" said Michael Turillo, partner in charge of the capital strategies group at KPMG Peat Marwick LLP.
Neither Norwest or Banc One would discuss potential interest in regional acquisitions.
""Our strategy is to add value to shareholders and acquisitions are one avenue to reach that goal,"" said Norwest spokesman Lawrence Haeg.
The aggressive move by NationsBank to buy Boatmen's is somewhat unusual in the latest wave of banking mergers because it will greatly extend the reach of the North Carolina-based bank. Many of the other transactions seen in the past two years have been in-market acquisitions that have resulted in large cost savings and branch closings.
Experts noted that serious questions remain about the success rate of major geographical expansion through acquisitions. For example, First Union Corp.'s acquisition last year of First Fidelity, which employed the same strategy as NationsBank, has fallen short of expectations.
Indeed, bank merger activity has already been capped this year by high prices and widespread concern that expansion will reduce the ability to cut costs -- a strategy that has been key to corporate mergers in the mid-1990s.
""There aren't so many obvious combinations left,"" said Ed Dillon, banking merger analyst at SNL Securities.
In the first half of 1996, bank merger activity tumbled 54 percent to $9.7 billion from $21 billion in the first half of 1995, according to Mergerstat Review, a unit of Los Angeles-based investment bank Houlihan Lokey Howard &amp; Zukin.
""With so many huge deals from last year, a lot of banks are just now coming up for air,"" said Susan Michaelson, managing director of Michaelson Kelbick Partners Inc., a New York-based firm that assists banks with post-merger marketing and communications.
Shares of regional banks rose sharply Friday on views that some of those banks may once again be acquisition targets. In a broadly lower market, U.S. Bancorp rose 1-9/16 to 38-1/2,, First Tennessee National gained 1 to 34-3/8 and First Commerce Corp. rose 1/4 to 35-3/4.
U.S. Bancorp ""has been and remains a very interesting acquisition candidate if somebody wants into the Northwest,"" said Scott McAdams of Ragen MacKenzie.
But analysts also noted that potential buyers are likely to be extremely sensitive about investor response to acquisition opportunities. Shares of NationsBank tumbled 7-1/8 to 85-1/4 on Friday on views the deal dilute earnings next year.

4859,"Chief executives of Conrail Inc., CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. are expected to hold a crucial meeting this week that could help put a giant railroad merger back on track.
Although final details still had not been set by late Monday, sources familiar with the plans said the meeting of the three executives was likely to occur by the end of the week.
""They are working on a date to meet in the next few days,"" said one source close to the railroads who did not want to be identified.
Conrail's David LeVan, CSX's John Snow and David Goode of Norfolk Southern last week agreed to hold discussions about the planned $9.5 billion merger of Conrail and CSX.
First announced in October, the planned transaction has been fraught with troubles due to a rival $10.3 billion bid from Norfolk Southern. Philadelphia-based Conrail has rejected the Norfolk Southern offer, contending that the CSX deal was a better fit.
Earlier this month, however, Conrail shareholders rejected a key measure needed for the CSX transaction to move forward.
Sources said that attorneys for the three railroads over the weekend hammered out terms of draft confidentiality pacts.
Only LeVan, Snow and Goode are expected to participate in the meeting.
Two other sources familiar with the companies' plans said the three railroads may announce as soon as Tuesday that a meeting has been scheduled, but likely will not provide any Like most industry experts, the sources involved in the transaction warned that any agreement between the three railroads will not be quick.
""I don't think this is an easy thing to resolve. It's a long way from saying this is a done deal,"" said one.
""I think everyone agrees its resolveable, but certainly the parties are starting out far apart,"" said another.
Some Wall Street experts have speculated that the ultimate conclusion will call for a splitting up of Conrail's assets.
But one of the sources close to Conrail stressed that LeVan still opposes carving up the railroad and distributing the pieces to Richmond, Va.-based CSX and Norfolk, Va.-based Norfolk Southern.
Meanwhile, Norfolk Southern executives will be in New York on Wednesday for a quarterly meeting with Wall Street analysts.

4860,"The bidding war for Conrail Inc. appears to be drawing to a close, but big legal and regulatory battles are right around the corner.
Industry analysts said Friday rival bidders CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. were unlikely to offer much more for Philadelphia-based Conrail, but both sides will pursue the fight elsewhere.
""That is the whole process that takes place over the course of 1997 -- the battle for market share as opposed to Conrail shares,"" said Anthony Hatch, analyst at NatWest Securities Corp.
CSX, based in Richmond, Va., Thursday revised its friendly merger pact with Conrail to give shareholders an extra $870 million in the cash and stock transaction. Based on Friday's stock activity, the deal is worth $9.3 billion, or about $102 per Conrail share.
A source close to CSX told Reuters Thursday that CSX and Conrail hoped the revised deal would end the bidding war.
But just hours after CSX and Conrail unveiled the new terms of their planned merger, rebuffed bidder Norfolk Southern increased its all-cash offer by $500 million to about $10.5 billion, or $115 per share.
""If someone were to start to bid higher than this, they probably wouldn't get the economies out of the deal to make it work so the bidding war, I think, has come to the end,"" said Charles Vincent of PNC Asset Management Group.
Although Norfolk Southern's bid has been higher throughout the two-month takeover fight, Conrail contends the union with CSX is a better strategic fit.
Industry experts said Norfolk, Va.-based Norfolk Southern, which has the financial power to bid more than $10.5 billion, merely wants to preserve the spread between the two offers while it fights a key aspect of the Conrail-CSX pact in court.
Norfolk Southern is challenging part of the transaction that prohibits either CSX or Conrail from seeking another merger partner before 1999.
Norfolk Southern last month lost a court fight in which it challenged previous terms of the deal, including a exclusivity provision that ruled out other talks before July 1997.
""This is a sign that they're not going to go bananaas (with a very high offer). If they're able to break the lock-up provision, they have a good bid,"" Hatch said.
""It was the right thing to do to keep pressure on the (Conrail) board,"" said one takeover stock trader, referring to investors who are unhappy with the Conrail board's decision to pursue the lower of the two bids.
A hearing on the exclusivity provision is scheduled for Jan. 9 in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia.
Few security analysts were predicting the hearing's outcome, but the takeover fight for Conrail is expected to continue no matter which company wins in court.
After the court fight, the next battle site will be Washington where the losing bidder is expected to vehemently challenge the merger. The deal already is expected to face intense scrutiny from the Surface Transportation Board, the federal agency that oversees railroads.
""You're going to have a lot of opposition to this,"" Vincent said, citing railroads, shippers and state agencies that are expected to express their opinions when the transaction reaches the regulatory stage.
Last week, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said it would intervene in any merger involving Conrail.
Conrail stock fell 75 cents to $100 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. CSX stock lost 37.5 cents to $43.375 and Norfolk Southern shares rose 87.5 cents to $89.25, also on NYSE.

4863,"Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst Inc will soon own Chef Boyardee, Polaner fruit spreads and PAM cooking spray, but the leveraged buy-out firm still has a big appetite for food companies.
The Dallas-based group, which announced on Friday a $1.3 billion acquisition of American Home Products Corp's food unit, plans to buy two Mexican food firms this year and does not intend to stop there, Chief Executive Officer Thomas Hicks told Reuters in a telephone interview.  
""Our plan is to use this as a platform,"" he said of the American Home Products deal, the biggest ever for Hicks Muse. ""We intend to start with this and grow both internally and through additional acquisitions of branded products.""
Seven-year-old Hicks Muse has been digesting food businesses for several years. It bought dairy firm Morningstar Group in 1991 and took the company public in 1992.
In March it bought Ghirardelli Chocolate Co from Boston buy-out specialist Thomas Lee.
It also owns Campfire marshmallows and Angela Marie's.  
""We like established brands because we think they offer the most ability of cash flow and long-term growth potential,"" Hicks said.
He said his firm had been searching for a large food acquisition and was alerted to the American Home Products food business about six months ago. Most Wall Street analysts had expected the unit to be bought by another food company.
The devotion to the food industry by Hicks Muse comes as U.S. food companies undergo major cost-cutting and restructuring programs due to the maturation of key products and intense competition for supermarket shelf space.  
On Thursday Campbell Soup Co unveiled a plan to repurchase stock, cut jobs and expand overseas in an effort to boost profits in the mature industry. And Nabisco Holdings Corp announced in June that it would cut 4,200 jobs as part of a cost-cutting program.
Hicks said the buy-out firm will finalize plans to integrate American Home Products's food business by the time the deal closes in 60 to 90 days.
""We have a vision of what we are going to do,"" Hicks said, but declined to be specific.  
One of Hicks's savviest investments was in the 1980s when he and fellow Dallas investor Robert Haas built a beverage powerhouse through acquisitions of soda brands A&amp;W, Seven-Up, Dr. Pepper and Squirt.
But the Hicks Muse group ran into trouble with its 1994 $390 million purchase of G. Heileman Brewing Co, maker of Lone Star beer and other brands. In July it sold the brewer to Stroh Brewery Co for an estimated $275-$300 million.
Other Hicks Muse investments include radio stations and a foam company.

4866,"The union of CVS Corp and Revco D.S. Inc creates a drugstore powerhouse that will dominate the U.S. Northeast and Southeast and likely marks the near-term end of mergers between the industry's biggest players.
But dozens of small publicly held and private chains still exist and are expected to get scooped up or join forces to combat industry leaders such as Walgreen Co, Rite Aid Corp, J.C. Penney's Thrift and the new CVS.  
""A number of companies in the sector are coming to us and asking us what they should do strategically,"" said Marty Murrer, managing director at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, which advised CVS in the Revco deal and has been a key player in the sector's biggest transactions.
Arbor Drug Inc, Genovese Drug Stores Inc and  Duane Reade Inc have been cited as candidates likely to participate in the consolidation sweeping the drugstore sector.
The union of Revco and CVS signals the final move in a tumultuous year for Twinsburg, Ohio-based Revco.  
A $1.8 billion friendly merger agreement between Revco and Rite Aid collapsed last April after state and federal regulators contended a combination would create antitrust issues and potentially drive up consumer prices.
Then in September, Revco launched a hostile offer for Big B Inc, which initially rejected its bid. But Big B, a southeastern chain, was unable to rebuff Revco for long, and the companies struck a friendly, $380 million deal in October.
Shareholders reacted positively to the Revco-CVS union, bidding Revco shares up 2-1/2 to 40-1/2 by Friday afternoon. The $2.8 billion deal values Revco at about 40 per share.  
The transaction will solidify CVS's position in the sector and allow it to expand significantly. Analysts said the companies have little geographic overlap, and the union is not expected to generate significant antitrust concerns.
On Friday, CVS also disclosed an aggressive growth plan that calls for 300 new stores or relocations each year.
""It's a great deal for CVS. The structure (of the deal) is going to allow it to be additive to earnings immediately. (CVS and Revco) are the two most dominant market share players in the industry, and market share is really the name of the game,"" said Eric Bosshard of Midwest Research-Maxus Group.  
Industry experts and Wall Street sources said Revco could have remained a viable company on its own. Revco and CVS last month confirmed their merger talks.
""I don't view this as a forced marriage. I view it as a marriage of great opportunity for the shareholders. Nobody has to do this,"" Murrer said.
Two shareholders likely to prosper from the merger are Revco Chief Executive Dwayne Hoven and Revco Co-chairman Sam Zell. Zell's Chilmark Fund LP holds a 19.2 percent stake in Revco. Hoven, who will not be joining the merged company, also has large holdings in Revco.

4869,"Ending a fierce bidding war for one of the last big merger prizes in the defense industry, General Motors Corp. said Thursday it will sell its Hughes Aircraft unit to Raytheon Co. in a $9.5 billion stock-and-debt deal.
The deal, a major setback to losing bidder Northrop Grumman Corp., will create a new missile and electronics giant with about $21 billion in annual revenues and 127,000 employees.
The merged company, which will retain the Raytheon name, will become the third-largest U.S. defense contractor, after the merger of Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Lockheed Martin Corp.
""We are truly creating another defense electronics powerhouse,"" Raytheon Chairman Dennis Picard said in a statment.
GM Chairman Jack Smith said the deal was aimed at unlocking value for GM shareholders and was a response to ""the rapidly changing landscape in the defense industry.""
After swallowing the Hughes assets, Raytheon will dominate the U.S. missile and radar businesses and will look a lot like the defense specialist it was in the 1970s, before it began diversifying, analysts said.
Hughes and Raytheon make similar products, including missiles, radar, air traffic control systems and other defense electronics.
Hughes, based in El Segundo Calif., makes the Tomahawk cruise missile, air-to-air missiles for fighter jets and the Stinger anti-aircraft missile, among others.
Raytheon, based in Lexington, Mass., makes the Patriot air defense missile system and competes with Hughes on many other missile contracts. Earlier this month it agreed to buy Texas Instruments Inc.'s defense electronics business for $2.95 billion.
Raytheon also makes Amana appliances and Beech business aircraft. Picard said the company was taking a ""hard look"" at the future of its commercial businesses and will reveal specific plans in the next couple of months.
To help pay for the Hughes deal, Edward D. Jones &amp; Co analyst William Fiala said Raytheon ""will look to spin off or outright sell one of three businesses -- appliances, aircraft and/or Engineering and Construction.""
Under the deal, Raytheon will contribute $5.1 billion in stock and assume $4.4 billion in newly created Hughes debt.
The deal involves a complicated tax-free spin-off of Hughes Aircraft to holders of GM's Class H common stock and its automotive stock, known as $1-2/3 par-value common stock. When it is finished, GM-related shareholders will own about 30 perent of the post-merger Raytheon.
Raytheon executives said the deal will dilute earnings per share slightly in 1997, but will add to earnings in 1998.
The transaction does not include the non-defense businesses of GM's Hughes Electronics Corp. subsidiary, which the automaker acquired in 1985 for $5.1 billion.
GM plans to move Delco Electronics, Hughes' automotive electronics business, back into its Delphi Automotive Systems parts operation.
Delco was brought under the Hughes umbrella in the 1980s as part of then-GM Chairman Roger Smith's grand and controversial scheme to fuse aerospace technology into automobiles, which produced mixed results at best.
GM CEO Jack Smith, no relation to Roger Smith, told reporters at a news conference in New York Thursday that the automaker will consider a future public offering or spin-off of the new Delphi-Delco unit, but declined to offer a timetable for that transaction.
Hughes Electronics will retain its lucrative telecommunications and space unit, which builds satellites and operates the fast-growing DirecTV satellite broadcasting service.
GM Vice Chairman Harry Pearce said in an interview that the automaker had no plans to sell any interest in those operations, which are poised for rapid growth in the next several years. Hughes Chairman C. Michael Armstrong will continue to run them.
Proceeds from the $4.4 billion in new debt to be assumed by Raytheon as part of the deal will be transferred to the Hughes telecommunications and space unit to fund future growth.
The telcom unit's operating profit for the first nine months of 1996 increased 35.2 percent from a year earlier to $193.5 million, on revenues of $2.89 billion. For all of 1995, it earned $189.2 million on revenues of $3.09 billion.
The Hughes defense units posted 1995 operating earnings of $688 million on revenues of about $6 billion.
The deal was announced in the last hour of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Raytheon shares closed up $1.50 to $48.50, while GM shares closed up 25 cents $60.375.
GM's Class H shares, which are tied to Hughes' performance but do not represent ownership in the company, ended unchanged at $62.625.
As part of the transaction, GM also plans to recapitalize its Class H stock to link it solely to the telecommunications and space business.
""In the past we have felt the market imposed a conglomerate discount to Class H stock because it tracked three businesses,"" Jack Smith told reporters. ""Now the recapitalized Class H stock will track only one high-growth area, telecommunications.""

4874,"ITT Corp. met with financial advisers on Thursday to assess an unsolicited $6.5 billion bid from Hilton Hotels Corp., while some Wall Street analysts said the company's best defense might be to pursue an acquisition.
Industry experts said ITT might be able to stave off the takeover if it made a large casino or hotel purchase.
""ITT is a company with a lot of friends on Wall Street and a lot of investment bankers and there are a lot of players in the gaming industry who would like to trade up to a higher quality,"" said Thomas Ryan of Bankers Trust.
Although ITT is widely expected to reject the offer, sources close to the company said no decision had been made and no acquisition talks were being held. ITT's board will consider the bid at a regularly-scheduled board meeting next Tuesday.
ITT declined to comment.
On Monday, Hilton offered to buy ITT in a stock and cash transaction that values the company at $55 per share. The offer also includes the assumption of $4 billion in debt.
The stock of New York-based ITT, which soared most of the week on views Hilton would be forced to raise the bid, fell 75 cents to $56.875.
On Friday, ITT's financial advisers are expected to pore over Hilton's official bid documents that are to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
An acquisition ""certainly would be in keeping with the company's history. (ITT Chairman Rand Araskog) has either got to be a buyer or he's got to let the company go,"" said Gerry Shapiro, managing director at KPMG Peat Marwick.
Industry experts said a sizable acquisition by ITT would thwart Hilton's takeover plan by making the purchase price too costly. In a telephone conference call with reporters earlier this week, Hilton Chief Executive Officer Stephen Bollenbach vowed the Beverly Hills, Calif.-based company would only pursue transactions that added to earnings.
Industry experts speculated that one of the most attractive acquisition candidates would be Harrah's Entertainment Inc., which has long been considered ripe to participate in industry consolidation.
A spokesman for Harrah's declined to comment.
An acquisition would also further solidify Araskog's role at the company he has run since 1979. He ran the ITT conglomerate and then took over the hotel, entertainment and gambling portion of the company when it split into three pieces in 1995.
""I think Rand Araskog doesn't want to give up his job.,"" said Forum Capital Markets analyst Philip Platek, who also speculated that ITT could buy a gambling or lodging company.

4880,"ITT Corp. moved forward on Monday with preparations for its Tuesday board meeting at which it will consider a $6.5 billion unsolicited takeover bid from Hilton Hotels Corp.
The meeting, to be held in New York, will be the first board session since Hilton launched its offer last week. The board, which has until Feb. 14 to respond to Hilton's offer, is not expected to make a decision right away.
ITT spokesman Jim Gallagher declined to disclose the time of the meeting. A source close to the company indicated that the session is likely to last most of the day.
On Saturday, ITT Chairman Rand Araskog turned down a request from Hilton's top executive to meet. Hilton Chief Executive Officer Stephen Bollenbach had asked to meet Araskog before Tuesday's board meeting or be permitted to make a presentation to the ITT board.
Araskog rejected the offer in a faxed letter to Bollenbach, saying it would be inappropriate.
The cash and stock transaction values ITT at $55 per share.
ITT stock, which rose sharply last week on views that Hilton will be forced to raise its bid, lost 25 cents to $56.875 in Monday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
As ITT was preparing for the meeting, Bollenbach flew to London on Monday to meet with Hilton's European partner. Hilton Hotels owns the rights to the Hilton brand in the United States and Ladbroke Group Plc. holds them in the rest of the world.
Hilton officials said Bollenbach, who was named to the Ladbroke board last month as part of the expanded alliance between the two companies, would attend a Ladbroke board meeting. He was due to return to the United States by mid-week.
Shares of Ladbroke traded in London rose on Monday amid speculation that ITT may bid for Ladbroke as part of its anticipated defense against a Hilton takeover. London analysts downplayed the speculation, which was fueled by a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing that disclosed Ladbroke and ITT had discussed a possible joint venture or merger a year ago.
Meanwhile, Hilton said Monday that it expects soon to announce other hotel acquisitions.
""There are a lot of things on our plate. We've got things working on the hotel side,"" Senior Vice President of Corporate Affairs Marc Grossman told reporters at an industry conference sponsored by Montgomery Securities. He declined to discuss details.
Separately, HFS Inc. Chairman Henry Silverman said in an interview that his company had been searching for a new hotel brand when it reached its latest agreement with Hilton. The Hilton offer for ITT includes a pact in which HFS would license ITT's Sheraton trademark, franchise system and management agreements.
Silverman said the preliminary agreement was struck with Hilton several days before it announced its offer for ITT and evolved from previous discussions between the two companies.
HFS is a consumer services company with hotel franchise, automotive and real estate holdings.

4885,"ITT Corp is expected to battle an unsolicited bid from Hilton Hotels Corp with an arsenal of defenses that include its well-known franchise name, its ""poison pill"" anti-takeover plan and the promise of future earnings power.
Wall Street takeover experts said the 29 percent premium offered by Hilton in its $6.5 billion offer for ITT is not enough to win the company.
""The franchise value alone is worth more than what they're offering,"" said one trader who did not want to be identified.  
Hilton earlier announced the cash and stock offer for ITT and kept open the possibility of a higher offer if it is permitted to look at ITT's financial data.
ITT could not be reached for comment.
Owner of properties such as Madison Square Garden, Caesar's World and the New York Knicks professional basketball team, ITT's stock price has been hurt recently by gaming construction disruptions and competition. Shares of ITT, which were trading at about 65 in June, closed Monday at 42-5/8.
But traders expect the stock price to rebound as a $2.5 billion capital expenditure program starts to pay off.  
""It's a company with a potentially very high value. Right now, the deck is stacked in favor of the target,"" said Eric Longmire of Wyser-Pratte &amp; Co Inc.
ITT is gambling much of its future on the $2.5 billion capital spending program, which will expand and update its casino operations. It opened the Las Vegas Desert Inn resort last month after a $160 million renovation.
In December, Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded its outlook on the company to negative from stable, saying that the capital spending plan would result in higher debt.  
""Since the break-up, they've been on an expansion binge. The excitement of the break-up is over and now the company has to perform,"" said the takeover trader.
Last week, chief operating offer Robert Bowman told Reuters in an interview that ITT may pursue hotel acquisitions this year. The company reportedly last year sought to buy Bally Entertainment Corp, but the hotel company eventually was sold to Hilton for $3 billion.
It also is expected this year to sell its $550 million stake in French telecommunications firm Alcatel Alsthom.
ITT was part of a huge conglomerate until 1995, when it spun off its manufacturing operations as ITT Industries and its insurance division as ITT Hartford Group Inc.
ITT Corp chief executive officer Rand Araskog has run the company since 1979 and took over as top executive of the entertainment and gaming company after the spin-off.

4887,"Tyco International Ltd. said Monday that it had made a $4 billion bid for American Standard Companies Inc. but would not pursue a merger after the maker of plumbing supplies and air conditioners rejected its offer.
""Tyco historically has not done hostile takeovers and we are not going to do a hostile takeover here,"" Senior Vice President David Brownell said in a telephone interview.
Brownell added that Tyco, a diversified manufacturing company, had not had any further contact with American Standard since its offer was rejected in early December, a day after it was made.
""We're off and doing other things. As far as we're concerned, it's past history,"" Brownell said.
In a letter dated Dec. 5, Tyco offered $50 a share, or about $4 billion, to acquire American Standard, which became a public company in February 1995.
Tyco said that under its proposal American Standard shareholders would have received $50 a share either in Tyco stock or cash, or a combination of both.
American Standard, however, rejected the offer almost immediately, believing it was in the best interest of its shareholders for it to remain independent.
""American Standard's board of directors reviewed the proposal and concluded that strategies already in place are working and the best way to increase earnings and shareholder value is to stay focused on carrying out the strategies as an independent company,"" the company said in a statement Monday.
""Accordingly, the company declined any interest in that proposal, has not had any discussions with Tyco concerning it and no discussions are contemplated.""
American Standard noted in its statement that its stock price had doubled since it went public in 1995 and it planned to proceed with an announced secondary public offering and repurchase of shares next month.
American Standard, based in Piscataway, N.J., is the parent of companies that produce Trane and American Standard air conditioning products, American Standard, Ideal Standard, and Standard plumbing products and WABCO commercial and utility vehicle brake and control systems.
Tyco, based in Exeter, N.H., had said in its proposal that a combination of the companies would benefit both and produce annual cost savings of at least $150 million to $200 million.
Brownell also said Tyco would still welcome friendly talks with American Standard.
""If the American Standard management would like to speak with us, we would be happy to speak with them,"" he said.
American Standard, however, insisted Monday that it was determined to remain independent.
Tyco's offer of $50 a share would have meant paying a steep premium for American Standard, whose shares closed Friday at $40.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Both company's shares were suspended from trading early Monday on the New York Stock Exchange after the Wall Street Journal reported Tyco's offer in its Monday issue.
In afternoon trading, American Standard was up $2.375 to $42.625, while Tyco rose 12.5 cents to $54.75.

4895,"CSX Corp and Conrail Inc were expected Thursday to announce sweetened terms for their proposed friendly $8.5 billion merger, according to sources familiar with the transaction.
The new terms were expected to include a richer exchange ratio in the stock portion of the cash and stock transaction and a speedier payment to investors by setting up a voting trust for all shares, the sources said.
Conrail and CSX have been discussing a sweetened deal for weeks in an attempt to appease shareholders who favour Norfolk Southern Corp's $10 billion all-cash bid for Conrail.
Specific details of the new terms were not immediately available. The CSX board reportedly met on Wednesday night to discuss the new terms.
A spokesman for CSX declined to comment. Conrail could not be reached for comment.
Early on Wednesday evening, a source close to the talks said the two companies were on the verge of reaching new terms.
""It's very close,"" said the source who did not want to be identified, adding the boards were pursuing revisions that would give shareholders ""more value and quicker payment"".
Upon announcing new terms for the controversial transaction, Conrail is expected to cancel a December 23 meeting in which shareholders were set to vote on a key provision of the deal.
CSX already has bought 19.9 percent of Conrail for $110 per share in a cash tender offer and is seeking to buy another 20.1 percent in a second cash tender offer.
CSX plans to buy the remaining 60 percent of Conrail shares in stock at an exchange ratio of 1.85619 CSX shares for each Conrail share.
Norfolk Southern has offered to buy Conrail for $110 per share in cash. Conrail has rejected the offer, contending that a transaction with CSX is a better fit.
But the Conrail-CSX merger needs shareholders to waive a Pennsylvania law in order for CSX to buy another 20.1 percent of Conrail. A U.S. judge on Tuesday ordered Conrail to conduct the December 23 meeting even though it contended that it could delay the vote if it didn't have enough shareholder support.
Conrail would be permitted to delay the meeting if it revised the existing merger agreement.
Shareholders have expressed concern that they would not receive payment for the stock portion of the transaction until the deal clears regulatory hurdles.
The proposed merger of Conrail and CSX, first announced on October 15, would create an powerhouse railroad on the U.S. East Coast.
But a revision of terms might not signal an end to the battle for Conrail. Industry experts have widely expected Norfolk Southern to quickly raise its bid if Conrail and CSC sweeten the terms of their proposal.
A spokesman for Norfolk Southern declined to comment on whether it will be prepared to raise its offer, noting only ""we have said that, whatever they do, we will respond appropriately"".

Richmond, Va.-based CSX and Conrail of Philadelphia are battling with Norfolk, Va.-based Norfolk Southern Corp., which has bid $10 billion, or $110 per share in cash, for Conrail. Conrail has rejected Norfolk Southern's offer, contending that a transaction with CSX is a better fit.
The new agreement would give Conrail shareholders another $16 per share, payable in CSX convertible preferred shares, as part of the stock portion of the cash and stock transaction.
Based on Thursday trading in CSX shares, an industry analyst estimated the value of the new CSX-Conrail deal at $104 per share, or $9.5 billion. The value of the stock portion of the deal changes daily as the stocks of the companies rise and fall.
""In every respect this merger holds great potential and clearly offers the best result for Conrail. This amendment to the merger agreement reaffirms the decision of the Conrail board that it is not willing to agree to the sale of Conrail to Norfolk Southern,"" Conrail Chairman David LeVan said in a statement.
Norfolk Southern immediately indicated that it was not walking away from its hostile effort. Industry experts widely expect it to raise its bid soon.
""There should be no doubt that Norfolk Southern remains as determined as ever to acquire Conrail and will use any and all appropriate financial means to accomplish that objective,"" Norfolk Southern said in a statement.
In a further enticement to investors, CSX and Conrail established a voting trust to accelerate payment to Conrail shareholders by 1997. Previously, shareholders would have not been paid until the transaction received required regulatory and other approvals.
The establishment of the voting trust is likely to encourage some shareholders to tender their stock to CSX and exit the controversial transaction, experts said.
One of the most controversial portions of the revised deal prohibits both CSX and Conrail from pursuing a merger with another company before the end of 1998. Shareholders, who had opposed the previous deadline of mid-1997 on the grounds that it prevented Conrail from considering a potentially higher offer, blasted the extension.
Members of the investment community also expect Norfolk Southern to challenge the exclusivity period in court. An attorney for Norfolk Southern said legal action was probably forthcoming.
Other aspects of the Conrail-CSX agreement are unchanged. They include $110 per share for 40 percent of the outstanding Conrail shares and 1.85619 shares of CSX common stock for each Conrail share.
CSX already has bought 19.9 percent of Conrail in a cash tender offer at $110 per share and is seeking to buy another 20.1 percent.
Conrail also delayed a special shareholder meeting to Jan. 17 from Dec. 23, and CSX extended its tender offer to Jan. 22. At the meeting, shareholders are to consider a key provision that would effectively permit CSX to proceed with the acquisition.
Many members of the investment community had predicted shareholders would defeat the provision.
While the new terms were widely considered to be more attractive, Wall Street and industry sources said they may not be strong enough to clinch the deal.
The new pact ""definitely doesn't lock it up because you've got to wait for Norfolk Southern to come back. It definitely makes it more attractive and more equitable across the board,"" said analyst Peter Gleason of Institutional Shareholder Services, a shareholder advisory firm that last week recommended investors defeat the provision at the special shareholder meeting.
The proposed merger of Conrail and CSX, first announced Oct. 15, would create a giant that would dominate the rail freight industry on the East Coast.
In afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Conrail shares rose $1.875 to $100.875, CSX shares fell $1.25 to $44 and Norfolk Southern rose $2.25 to $88.50.
""The actions taken by the CSX and Conrail boards allow us to move on to the next stage of the process, the filing of our merger application with the (Surface Transportation Board),"" the federal regulatory agency overseeing railroads, said CSX Chairman John Snow.
Anthony Hatch of NatWest Securities noted that the deal was becoming less financially attractive to the prospective buyers as the bidding war continues.
""We're bumping up against the point at which this is getting pricey. It still makes some sense, but for CSX it's getting close,"" Hatch said, adding that Norfolk Southern can well afford to raise its offer.

4901,"Tobacco company lawyers defending against the $5 billion Broin secondhand-smoke lawsuit are ahead in the race to seat favorable jurors, repeatedly knocking out nurses and others who say secondhand smoke probably causes disease, according to trial consultants.
""Tobacco's been really lucky at getting out people with knowledge about smoking and health -- all those nurses,"" said one Florida trial consultant after five days of jury picking for the Broin trial. ""The plaintiffs must be crying.""
Thirty-two people, out of more than 75 closely questioned by rival lawyers and the trial judge, passed initial screening last week and may be among the six chosen to decide whether or not cigarette giants such as Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds Tobacco are liable for heart ailments and other smoking-related diseases among 60,000 flight attendants who never smoked.
The flight attendants, including Norma Broin, a 42-year-old employee of American Airlines who had lung cancer, allege that cigarette smoke from passengers aboard U.S. passenger jets caused their illnesses. Smoking on U.S. jets was banned in 1988.
""The tobacco lawyers are maneuvering very well to get jurors excused for cause,"" said Stanley Rosenblatt, who along with his wife is pressing the landmark flight-attendants lawsuit. ""They don't want anyone educated who knows that secondhand smoke causes disease.""
The trial consultants monitoring jury-picking agreed, with one saying the perfect juror for the tobacco industry would be a conservative white male smoker with minimal formal education.
""You could hear a groan in the courtroom when that snuff user got bumped,"" said one consultant, referring to a Caucasian father in his thirties who dismissed the flight attendants' lawsuit as ridiculous. ""They really wanted him.""
By contrast, the Rosenblatts ideally want mothers in the jury pool with at least a college education, a distaste for smoking and a healthy suspicion of big institutions such as highly profitable tobacco companies, the consultants said.
Tobacco lawyers declined to comment, but the trial consultants, speaking on a promise of anonymity, said, ""Anyone in the health industry is good for the Rosenblatts and bad for the tobacco companies.""
Several nurses, including a nun who described smoking as a vice since it was harmful to both smokers and non-smokers, were challenged successfully by tobacco lawyers for causes such as an anti-tobacco bias. Like the Rosenblatts, the tobacco lawyers later in the jury-picking can block as many as 27 people from the jury without any explanation.
While many people questioned last week objected to smoking on health grounds, only one person, a bank executive with two small children, said she had a strong bias against ""powerful and influential tobacco companies.""
A dozen or more prospective jurors said U.S. airlines that employed the flight attendants were responsible for any sicknesses caused by secondhand smoke and not the tobacco companies. The airlines are sheltered from the lawsuits by U.S. workers' compensation laws, passed in the early 1900s, lawyers said.
Among the people chosen as standby jurors were a civil engineer, a newspaper-truck driver, a waiter, a painter and a retired police-department dispatcher. Some were smokers or ex-smokers and many were non-smokers.
Rosenblatt and the trial consultants said they were at this time unconcerned about the jury's eventual composition since another 30 or so standbys had to be chosen and discretionary challenges can always be used. Jury selection is to continue Monday and Tuesday and resume again on June 16.
The consultants said rulings by trial Judge Robert Kaye of Dade County Circuit Court on standby jurors at first seemed to favor the flight attendants, but later tilted toward tobacco companies.
The judge has twice reversed decisions on standby jurors, including knocking out a Miami television-news producer on Thursday whom a day earlier he had let into the standby group over tobacco lawyers' objections. Kaye reversed himself after seeing a two-minute news story she had produced on the marketing of flashily packaged micro-brand cigarettes such as Black Death and City.
Late on Friday, Kaye changed course again and ordered that jury questioning be done in groups of six, instead of by individual examination, as a way of accelerating jury selection.

4906,"Cigarette companies fighting lawsuits in Florida are being haunted in courtrooms by best-selling novelist John Grisham's ""Runaway Jury,"" a tale of jury manipulation at a tobacco trial.
In ""Runaway Jury,"" a tobacco industry operative commissions a burglary and other crimes as part of a juror-tampering campaign.
The novel's title has become shorthand for anti-tobacco lawyers who are concerned that life might imitate art -- something that angers the lawyers representing tobacco firms.
""We are up here and having to defend against a fictitious novel, and I don't know why,"" attorney Ed Moss of Brown &amp; Williamson said on Monday at a Miami hearing before a class-action suit against cigarette makers. ""This is ridiculous.""
""We have not and will not go out and investigate the jurors,"" Moss said.
Moss, speaking for Brown, a unit of B.A.T. Industries of Britain, and eight other tobacco companies, pledged to Dade County Circuit Court Judge Robert Kaye that the tobacco companies would not use private investigators, jury experts or researchers in selecting jurors in the class-action suit.
Such techniques, while costly, are legal and are frequently used in high-profile U.S. trials in the belief that the backgrounds of jurors determine likely votes on legal issues. Investigators hunt out information about jurors that might allow them to be barred from hearing a case.
Anti-tobacco lawyers repeatedly assert that tobacco companies, with their deep ranks of lawyers and strong financial resources, can easily outmatch them in jury selection.
There was no evidence of any improper juror investigations by tobacco companies at any time, Moss said.
Potential jurors for an individual lawsuit starting on Monday against RJR Nabisco RJ Reynolds Tobacco in Jacksonville, Florida, were also being asked whether or not they had read ""Runaway Jury"", published last year by Doubleday and on the best-seller lists for months.
And lawyers pressing a third case, the State of Florida's lawsuit to recover medical spending on sick smokers, have also complained in court hearings about potential pressures by tobacco companies on jurors.
Lawyer Stanley Rosenblatt, pressing the Miami class-action suit on behalf of Norma Broin and an estimated 60,000 other sick, non-smoking flight attendants, said the tobacco companies were capable of shaping a jury through those outside means.
He welcomed Moss's pledge to rely only on a written questionnaire and in-court inquiries to select jurors for the scheduled June 2 trial.
But Rosenblatt also urged Kaye to keep secret the names of all potential jurors and, as an added safeguard, to identify jurors only by number during a trial expected to last eight to 12 weeks.

4909,"Any sweeping settlement among state governments and tobacco companies would leave standing a great many anti-smoking suits, including a $5 billion claim scheduled for a June 2 trial, plaintiff lawyers said on Friday.
""It's a lousy settlement for my clients and the American people,"" said Stanley Rosenblatt, one of two lawyers pressing the Broin class-action suit here on behalf of flight attendants claiming injuries from secondhand tobacco smoke.  
Rosenblatt's case goes to trial on June 2 and is a landmark, because it is both the first class-action suit against cigarette makers to survive preliminary legal challenges and the first trial of a claim of damage from second-hand smoke.
Some 1,000 anti-tobacco lawsuits currently exist in U.S. courts against tobacco companies, according to Richard Daynard of the Tobacco Products Litigation Project at Northeastern University.  
Norwood Wilner, another Florida attorney who secured a $750,000 jury judgment against the Brown &amp; Williamson unit of B.A.T Industries Plc in 1996, has no plans to delay his next trial, said his legal aide, Jenny Stieger.
""We have a trial date of August 4, for another lady with lung cancer,"" Stieger said.
Wilner on May 5 lost a suit on behalf of smoker Jean Connor, who was killed by lung cancer, against RJ Reynolds Tobacco Co, a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.  
Reynolds, the maker of Winston and Salem brand cigarettes, will also be the defendant in the August trial on the claim of Joann Karbinyk, Stieger said.
Another anti-tobacco lawyer, Ronald Acosta, has two tentative trial dates scheduled for summer in U.S. District Court in Tampa, Florida. Wilner expects to try still another case in November, Stieger said.  
Other cases expected to come to trial in 1997 include another class-action on behalf of Florida smokers in September and a secondhand smoke case in Mississippi brought by the family of a non-smoking barber who allegedly died of cancer caused by the cigarette smokers awaiting haircuts in his shop.
According to published reports, in part challenged by Mississippi Attorney General Michael Moore, tobacco companies and the 29 state governments suing the industry for billions in healthcare spending on smokers are near a deal limiting the number and type of lawsuits which could be brought by smokers.  
The Wall Street Journal said the proposed terms would make it nearly impossible for future smokers to sue cigarette makers for lung cancer and other common tobacco-related illnesses. ""The global settlement is not a done deal,"" said Stieger. ""There is not a whole lot of support for a deal messing with the tort system.""
Attorney Rosenblatt said during a pre-trial hearing for the Broin class-action suit that the tobacco industry and the attorneys general would reach a settlement.  Tobacco lawyers would then go to ""a friendly court"" and ask it to halt the Broin trial.  
""I don't think that's going to be successful, but that's the plan,"" he said.
Michael Russ, a lawyer for Brown &amp; Williamson, told Reuters as the hearing broke for lunch: ""If that is the plan, I don't know about it.""

4910,"Office Depot stopped building superstores when it agreed to merge with Staples Inc and will have to scramble to regain its footing if it remains alone, industry analysts said on Friday.
""They need to circle the wagons and begin rebuilding management and decide what kind of company they want to be,"" said Mark Mandel of The Chicago Corp. ""They've lost lots of momentum.""  
The deal to combine Staples and Office Depot, reached in September, would have created a dominant force in office-supply retailing with about 1,000 stores. Rival OfficeMax has between 700 and 800 superstores.
But federal regulators earlier on Friday struck a blow that was potentially fatal to the transaction, saying such a combination would cripple price competition for office supplies in some markets.
The companies denounced the decision by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and Staples chief executive Thomas Stemberg told reporters Staples may challenge the FTC ruling in court.  
""Computer sales collapsed and paper prices were deflating but their margins held up,"" McMullin said. ""And the infrastructure's in place.""
But McMullin said the rejection by the FTC and the prospect of a court battle were clouding Office Depot's outlook.
Staples shares rose after the FTC ruling and closed at 21-7/8, or 5/8 higher. Office Depot shares dropped 6 to 13, after having fallen as low as 12, or roughly the price at which they were trading before the September merger announcement.
""Staples is up and Office Depot is down. If they were going to get together, you'd expect more harmony,"" McMullin said.

4914,"Philip Morris Cos. Inc. Chief Executive Geoffrey Bible said Thursday that the world's largest cigarette maker was open to ""reasonable measures"" aimed at resolving anti-tobacco lawsuits in the United States.
Bible declined to comment on negotiations between cigarette companies and anti-smoking forces on a possible resolution of hundreds of lawsuits and stricter regulations facing the beleaguered but highly profitable industry.
But he told shareholders at the company's annual meeting that ""we will listen and explore all reasonable measures.""
He also said Philip Morris was willing to work with government officials to hammer out new regulations on tobacco sales, even as the industry fights a court battle against tough new restrictions on sales, especially to minors, put in place by the Food and Drug Administration earlier this year.
""We are willing to work with responsible government representatives and others on a balanced system,"" Bible said.
He did not spell out what initiatives he might consider, other than to say Philip Morris favored restrictions on young people buying cigarettes and two years ago launched its own program to limit people under 21 from obtaining cigarettes.
""We do not want kids to smoke,"" Bible said.
Anti-smoking groups have said the industry targets its advertising to encourage young people to smoke.
Bible also said Philip Morris would continue fighting the of hundreds of individual, state and class-action suits it faces ""vigorously.""
Tobacco executives have met for the first time in recent weeks with state officials and anti-smoking activists on possibly settling the massive litigation against the industry.
Negotiators said on Wednesday they had met on Sunday and Monday in Chicago but reported that no deal was imminent, a White House official said after negotiators from both sides briefed White House deputy counsel Bruce Lindsey.
Published reports have said the industry might pay as much as $300 billion over 25 years into a compensation fund for smokers who fall sick with lung cancer and other diseases. In return, cigarette makers would get broad shelter from lawsuits and would likely see higher stock market valuations on their tobacco and non-smoking businesses.
Outside the Philip Morris meeting, about 20 protesters wearing giant Marlboro cigarette costumes greeted shareholders arriving for the meeting at the company's biggest plant.
""Shame on Philip Morris,"" read signs carried by the protestors from INFACT, a Boston-based anti-smoking group that says Philip Morris uses its lobbying to harm public health.
Marlboro, Philip Morris' best-known brand, helps the company capture about 50 percent of all domestic cigarette sales.
Other protestors wore big ""Uncle Sam"" hats and took play money from the people dressed as Philip Morris cigarettes.
A spokeswoman for Philip Morris said the INFACT protestors were welcome to voice their opinions.
Philip Morris stock rose $1 to $41.75 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

4917,"There will be more smoke than fire when Philip Morris Cos. Inc. holds its annual meeting with shareholders Thursday.
Meeting in Richmond, Va., amid reports tobacco companies are pondering a $300 billion landmark settlement, analysts say it is unlikely Philip Morris will tip its hand.
""No comment. No comment. No comment. I've heard it a hundred times,"" said Roy Burry, a tobacco industry analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. ""The industry is shut down on this.""
Philip Morris holds 50 percent of the U.S. cigarette market and is a lead negotiator in talks with anti-tobacco forces aimed at resolving massive legal claims against the industry.
Geoffrey Bible, chief executive of Philip Morris, and the head of RJR Nabisco, the No. 2 U.S. tobacco group, have participated in the talks, sources familiar with the bargaining have said. The latest round of talks, in Chicago, ended Monday.
U.S. regulation of cigarette makers and other non-monetary issues have so far dominated the talks, according to sources. But the Wall Street Journal said Tuesday that rivals of Philip Morris are pushing for lock-step cigarette price increases by all companies to pay for a proposed fund for sick smokers.
RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., according to the paper, quoting unnamed sources, is particularly worried that the financially thriving Philip Morris might forgo price increases in order to grab market share from smaller rivals such as No. 2 RJ Reynolds Tobacco Co.
Analysts discounted the likelihood of such a pact, saying mutual pricing would violate U.S. antitrust laws and would go against the widespread retail practice of selling all cigarettes within a category at the same price.
""There are a thousand different ways other than pricing to get customers to buy your cigarettes,"" said analyst Emanuel Goldman of Paine Webber.
A spokesman for Philip Morris declined to comment on the talks.
At the Philip Morris annual meeting, scheduled to begin at 9 a.m. EDT, activist shareholders are expected to present proposals urging the company to eliminate the suspected carcinogen benzo(a)pyrene from its cigarettes and that outside directors doing substantial business with Philip Morris stay out of meetings setting executives salaries.
A third shareholder proposal, sponsored by The Sisters of Charity of New York, urges Philip Morris to adopt in developing countries the same limits on marketing cigarettes to young people it has adopted in the United States.
The company's board opposes all the proposals.
One activist group supporting the proposals, INFACT of Boston, will also have protestors outside the Philip Morris Manufacturing Centre, INFACT executive director Kathryn Mulvey said.
INFACT played a leading role during the 1970s and 1980s in a boycott of Nestle over alleged mismarketing of infant formula in poor countries and charges Philip Morris with unfair lobbying of government officials.
INFACT also wants Philip Morris to change its marketing practices in developing countries, she said.
Mulvey said the widely reported, historic talks between cigarette makers and anti-tobacco organisations had had no effect on INFACT's plans to protest.
""There's nothing that we've heard ... that has anything to do with marketing to kids in developing countries or influence peddling,"" Mulvey said.

4922,"In Miami, the cruise-ship capital of the world, business is bright with bountiful bookings but eyes are warily looking up the Florida coast to where The Walt Disney Co. is readying its sea-going debut.
Essentially landlocked until next year, Disney is the 800-pound gorilla of U.S. holiday-making and currently operates hotels and leading theme parks, such as its Disney World in Orlando. To many in cruising, Disney is already a leading rival for vacation dollars.
Disney, adding attractions in Orlando, Fla., and eager to keep its customers staying with Disney for longer vacations, is indeed offering week-long cruises from Port Canaveral, Fla., on its cartoon-themed ships that include stays at its parks and a visit to a Disney island in the Bahamas.
The company is already taking bookings for April, 1998, and many in the industry see Disney aiding all cruise ships -- and not just the Disney Magic and Disney Wonder due next year -- as Disney broadens a market which draws mainly older customers.
""They are great marketers,"" Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. Chief Financial Officer Richard Glasier said before the industry's recent Seatrade Cruise Shipping Convention here. ""They'll open up new aspects of the business.""
Disney is renowned for family entertainment and leisure, a segment leading cruise operators courting mass markets want to win, too. An existing cruise service under a third-party licensing agreement with Disney has not had a major role in the cruise market, executives said.
""Disney promotion will add more power in marketing than this has ever seen,"" said Peter Kowal, general manager of the Cruise Holidays travel-agents chain.
On Wall Street, many worry the industry's ship-building spree is getting ahead of itself and that weak fare pricing evident last year will become chronic. Disney's two ships, weighing 85,000 tons and carrying 1,740 passengers each, will aggravate those worries.
But bookings at Carnival Corp., the industry leader with 26.9 percent of the sector's 116,616 berths worldwide, and No. 2-ranked Royal Caribbean have been very strong this year, even with the addition of many new, very large ships.
""The tone of business is terrific,"" Glasier told investors last week.
Larger ships, including the just christened Carnival Destiny, the world's biggest at 100,000 tons and 2,600 berths, are much more efficient and much more attractive to vacationers, industry executives said.
A Royal Caribbean ship features a decktop golf course and some big ships have multi-deck atriums. The race to be bigger continues, with Royal Caribbean contracting last year to buy two ships capable of carrying 3,100 people and weighing 130,000 tons. Until this decade, few cruise ships carried more than 1,000 passengers or weighed more than 50,000 tons.
Glasier said Royal Caribbean's big ships generate twice or three times the cash flow of older ships, partly because of higher fares and more on-board shops but also because of cheaper operating costs on a per-passenger basis.
Disney's entry also comes as leisure cruising is consolidating and as the industry tiptoes toward globalization from its North American stronghold. Asia, especially, is seen as a promising market.
""There's a lot of interest in the emerging markets in Asia,"" Carnival Cruise Lines President Bob Dickinson said.
Outside North America, where trips to Caribbean islands out of Florida and to Alaska from the West Coast are most popular, the markets are relatively small. Europe, the most developed market behind the United States and Canada, is only 20 percent the size of the North American one.
Carnival late last year announced a $300 million acquisition of Costa Crociere SpA, Europe's leading cruise operator, and earlier bought a stake in British tour company Airtours. The company has also reached a joint venture with Hyundai Merchant Marine for an Asia cruise offering.
""We are attempting to source passengers outside the United States,"" Royal Caribbean's Glasier said.
Royal Caribbean is studying the Asian market and may create a separate brand for the market, Glasier said.
""In Asia, the product should be different. We would probably do that with a different brand,"" Glasier said.

4927,"The prize in their hands, the question now is whether Ted Turner and Gerald Levin will feud or combine to exploit the golden opportunities being offered by the merger of Time Warner Inc. and Turner Broadcasting System.
The companies, whose merger will create the world's largest media group, won approval on Thursday for their year-old deal from the Federal Trade Commission. The Federal Communications Commission is expected to give its approval soon, and final approval by shareholders of both companies is scheduled for Oct. 10.
While it is already known that Levin, the Time Warner chairman, and Turner, founder and head of Turner Broadcasting, will occupy the top spots at the new Time Warner, analysts wonder about their chemistry.
The low-key Levin will be chairman and chief executive while the flamboyant Turner, who created Cable News Network and other major media properties, will be vice-chairman.
""The management side remains unclear, the division of duties remains unclear,"" said Smith Barney analyst Jill Krutick.
""They have very different management styles,"" said analyst Dennis McAlpine of Josephthal Lyon &amp; Ross. ""A lot depends on which Ted you get -- Ted the imaginative, creative and dynamic or Ted the meddler,"" he said.
Both Turner and Levin have pledged to cooperate, but only time will tell if the two strong-willed managers will be able to co-exist at top of the huge company.
In addition, the roles of second-tier executives at Turner Broadcasting have not been announced. Speculation about departures picked up when severance packages worth $29 million for eight Turner officials became public.
Analysts said, however, the business fundamentals of the combination were strong.
Together the companies will control top-tier programming and distribution systems for filmed entertainment and will have real strength with cable operators and advertisers both in the United States and elsewhere.
Aside from being the nation's No. 2 cable-TV operator, Time Warner owns the Warner Bros. movie studios and Time, People, Sports Illustrated and Fortune magazines.
In addition to CNN, Turner Broadcasting also owns film and TV studios, a cartoon cable-TV channel and the Atlanta Braves and Atlanta Hawks sports teams.
Turner has been assigned oversight of the combined company's cable-television programming, services such as The Cartoon Network and TNT.
But whether or not Time Warner's own cable-programming service, Home Box Office, will be placed under Turner is still not known, McAlpine said.
He also said it was unknown whether the film and TV production studios now owned by Turner Broadcasting -- Castle Rock and New Line Cinema -- would be report to Turner or be assigned to the executives running the highly successful Warner Brothers studio operations.
There is also the possibility the two Turner studios could be sold. Krutick said she expected decisions on selling the Turner studios, including Castle Rock, which is being shopped around, to be taken up very quickly after the merger closes.
""If they can unwind an asset, one that's duplicative, and pay down debt, I think they will,"" said Krutick.

4938,"Top Citicorp managers have testified before a grand jury probing allegations of possible money laundering involving former Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's brother, Citicorp Chief Executive Officer John Reed said Wednesday.
Reed, answering a shareholder at the giant banking company's annual meeting, neither identified the executives nor said how many had given secret testimony but emphasised that Citicorp was cooperating fully with the grand jury.
Raul Salinas, now jailed in Mexico on murder and illicit enrichment charges, was accused in February by a Swiss prosecutor of receiving huge sums of money from major drug cartels. Some $100 million was found in Raul Salinas' Swiss bank accounts.
Both Raul Salinas and his brother, the former Mexican president now in self-imposed exile in Ireland, deny any connections to illegal drug operators.
Reed told reporters immediately after the meeting that he himself had not been summoned by the grand jury, a panel of citizens which reviews police evidence for the possible filing of criminal charges.
A Citicorp spokesman declined to say how many executives had testified before the grand jury, believed to be meeting in New York. Citicorp is based in New York.
Questioned by shareholders about the offshore transfers, reportedly as high as $120 million, by Citicorp on behalf of Raul Salinas de Gortari, Reed said the global banking group had no apparent financial liability.
""To the best of our knowledge -- and we have looked, looked and looked -- we have no liability,"" Reed said.
He said Citicorp has not set aside any funds for possible fines, and a representative of Citicorp auditor Peat Marwick said it had not questioned that decision.
Citicorp has so far spent $4 million on legal fees for the Salinas inquiry, Reed said. The fees include a lawyer for Amy Elliott, the banker who handled the Salinas accounts from New York, the spokesman said.
""Her behaviour met with our standards, and she is an employee in good standing,"" Reed said.

4940,"U.S. billionaire Wayne Huizenga shrugged off lawsuits filed by two Japanese motor giants, saying on Tuesday that the AutoNation car-retailing arm of his Republic Industries Inc never aspired to control one of every five Toyota and Honda sales in the United States.
Both Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co Ltd have filed suits in U.S. courts against AutoNation, one of several buyout companies prowling the tens of thousands of independent car retailers in the United States.
Each company wants AutoNation to stop buying retailers which sell its cars. In its suit filed last week, Honda said AutoNation was cheapening its Honda and Acura brands.
Both companies limit the number of dealerships which can be owned by one proprietor and have said AutoNation wants to control 20 percent of their U.S. sales.
""We never said 20 percent and we never expected to get that much,"" Huizenga told the annual shareholders meeting of Republic. ""We know we will be partners with them.""
A renowned businessman credited with creating giant video-retailer Blockbuster and Waste Management Corp, Huizenga said AutoNation could take minority stakes in Toyota and Honda dealerships or use other techniques for tapping into the strong sales flows of highly popular Toyota and Honda vehicles.
""There are ways to accomplish what we want,"" Huizenga said.
Huizenga is chairman and co-chief executive of Republic, an auto-services, home-security and garbage-hauling conglomerate which has bought dozens of small car dealerships and other businesses in the past 18 months using Republic's high-flying shares in stock-swaps.
But Republic's shares are 25 percent or more off their highs, at least in part to investors worries that rivals are beginning to narrow AutoNation's lead in consolidating used and new car dealerships.
Ford Motor Co executives last week briefed dealers in Indianopolis, Indiana, on a voluntary and highly innovative plan to gather together about 18 Indianapolis-area Ford and Lincoln-Mercury dealerships into five or six giant sales outlets with stand-alone, satellite service facilities for light repairs and warranty work.
The giant centres, similar to the 11 AutoNation superstores now operating, would be owned by Ford and by participating dealers, a Ford spokesman has said.
Ford is looking to test the concept in two or three medium-sized markets in the next two to three years with an eye to a possible public offering.
""We welcome that,"" Republic president Steve Berrard said. ""We think it's a great endorsement.""
Besides AutoNation, Circuit City Stores Inc.'s CarMax and others are using many of the customer-friendly techniques pioneered by General Motors Corp's Saturn unit to court the two of every three Americans who hate to haggle.
Both GM and Chrysler Corp have had programmes to reduce their dealership ranks through consolidation and buy-outs, but neither has proposed as radical a restructuring of its distribution system.

4946,"General Electric Co. Chief Executive Jack Welch defended his $28.2 million in salary, bonuses and incentives for 1996, telling shareholders Wednesday that market forces determined pay packages for top U.S. executives.
""The issue is the competitive marketplace,"" he told a critic at GE's annual meeting. ""The market is willing to play at a certain level ...""
Stockholders at the meeting defeated a proposal to limit Welch's pay to $1 million unless put to a shareholder vote.
The proposal to limit Welch's pay received 9 percent of the votes cast, with 91 percent backing Welch's existing compensation arrangements.
Bill Patterson of the AFL-CIO group of labour unions, a supporter of the effort to put a cap on Welch's paycheck, said Welch's compensation was 148 times more than that paid on average to GE's 239,000 employees.
The proposal was made by a Teamsters union pension fund.
Patterson said the pay, even with Welch's highly acclaimed management successes and the stellar stock market performance of GE's shares since he became chief executive 16 years ago, was a source of bitterness and cynicism for many GE workers.
Welch said he was well paid and was benefitting from the labour of all GE's employees. He noted that stock options were now distributed to some 22,000 GE employees, as opposed to only 200 as recently as 1988.
Big pay packages, including deferred compensation plans, were needed to retain top performers, Welch said. He said some top GE executives, such as the current head of AlliedSignal Inc. had left the company for more pay and broader opportunities.
Welch, the latest U.S. chief executive to be criticised for high compensation, last year received $6.3 million in salary, $15.1 million from a long-term incentive programme and $6.2 million by excercising options on GE stock.
He was also paid almost $600,000 in benefits, such as life insurance, according to GE's proxy statement.
Walt Disney Co. stockholders, including several leading institutional investors, two months ago challenged a 10-year pay package given Chairman Michael Eisner worth as much as $771 million. Twelve percent of Disney shares were voted against the Eisner pay package.
One study said CEO pay rose about 20 percent in 1996 and 16 percent in 1995.

4947,"A Miami television journalist who produced a news report on niche-brand cigarettes was knocked from the pool of standby jurors in Florida's $5 billion secondhand smoke trial on Thursday.
The unidentified female television-news producer was among 15 people questioned by judge and lawyers on Wednesday. She said she had produced a television report for Fox station WSVN Channel 7 on cigarette marketing, scheduled for broadcast that evening. Despite tobacco lawyers objections, she was placed in the pool of potential jurors to sit on the trial, expected to last eight weeks or longer.
Tobacco company lawyers again on Thursday asked Dade County Circuit Court Judge Robert Kaye to remove the freelance news producer, saying her piece negatively portrayed tobacco companies and reflected a bias making her unsuitable to fairly decide whether the defendants are liable for the smoking-related illnesses of 60,000 non-smoking flight attendants.
A tape of the short television report on flashily packaged Black Death, City and other so-called micro-brand cigarettes favored by some young smokers was shown in court and included interviews with shopkeepers, young smokers and a spokeswoman for the American Cancer Society.
Stanley Rosenblatt, an attorney pressing the class-action suit, said the television report had been very likely edited by other journalists and did not necessarily reflect the mindset of the news producer.
But Kaye sided with the tobacco lawyers and removed the woman from the standby jurors pool, saying, ""The appearance that it was weighted would make it inappropriate for her to be seated.""
After four days of jury selection, the standby jurors pool numbers 18. Some 60 are needed to seat a jury of six. A second round of screening will be required to find between six and 12 alternates before testimony can begin in the landmark trial, a court official said.
A nurse, a college student and an immigrant from Mexico were placed in the standby pool on Thursday. People excused by Kaye include a nun who described smoking as a vice and the sure cause of diseases she has seen firsthand as a nurse and several people with schooling or vacation plans fixed firmly during June and July.
Kaye late on Wednesday said he was reconsidering a Rosenblatt request that prospective jurors be questioned in groups as a way of speeding up jury selection. Tobacco company lawyers objected, saying that since smoking and attitudes about secondhand cigarette smoke were hot-buttom matters people had to be questioned separately.
A court official said Kaye would likely decide on group questioning of prospective jurors on Friday or later. Kaye earlier this week refused a similar request from Rosenblatt.
Jury questioning for the trial, the first on secondhand smoke claims, is likely to run through at least mid-June, in part because the jury selection next week will occur only on Monday and Tuesday because of a break for Jewish holidays.

4952,"Cable and Wireless Communications (CWC), Britain's biggest and newest cable telephone and television group will float a 14.7 percent stake in London and New York early next week.
The flotation, which is not big enough to propel the new company into the FTSE, has been expected since CWC was formed in 1996 by merging the Mercury unit of Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc with the three British cable TV units of NYNEX Corp and Bell Canada.
The recommended offer for shares in CWC, which has been valued by analysts at an average of around 4.5 billion pounds ($7.3 billion), closed on Friday at 1330 GMT and experts expect trading to start on Monday at 1330 GMT.
No confirmation of the level of acceptances was expected before 1600 GMT, but the offer was recommended and over 65 percent of shareholders accepted the deal when CWC's complex prospectus was issued in March.
Richard Brown, the incoming chairman of CWC and chief executive of Cable and Wireless, says the company will be customer-led and market-driven and has promised a flotation immediately after the offer closes.
After the merger, there will be only one brand name  -- Cable and Wireless -- and a huge advertising campaign is planned ensure the name wins public recognition.
With assets worth about 4.5 billion pounds, CWC will provide a broad range of local, national and international voice and data services and, in some regions, multichannel TV and internet computer services.
Despite bringing together cable TV groups NYNEX CableComms, Bell Cablemedia Plc and Videotron, CWC's core business will be the telephony provided by Mercury. It will be British Telecommunications's main rival.
But with initially only 1.1 million residential telecom and 80,000 business customers compared to BT's 20.5 million residential and about seven million business clients, some analysts say the new company will only pose a serious threat to BT in the middle of the next Century.
""I don't see CWC as a threat (to BT) in the short and medium term,"" said Oliver Ehrenberg, telecoms anlayst at Robert Flemming.
Initially, around 91 percent of revenues will be derived from telecoms and only nine percent from TV entertainment, although this is expected to grow.
The company hopes to be the first to roll out its 200-channel service ahead of its rivals, which include satellite broadcaster BSkyB, possibly by autumn.
CWC plans to complete its broadband cable and local telephony networks by investing some 110 million pounds over two years and offer services to more than six million residential customers by 2001.
It also wants to serve almost all small and medium-sized businesses within its 45 cable franchise areas.
Another 180 million pounds will be spent over the same period on so-called set top boxes, with which customers can receive multi-channel television services.
But with 2.3 billion pounds of capital expenditure in the first two years and initial net debt of 1.3 billion pounds, Ehrenberg does not expect investors to receive a dividend before 2001 at the earliest.
Cable and Wireless, which will have a 52.6 percent stake in CWC, wants to remain a majority shareholder and has said it will consider boosting its investment if partners back out.
NYNEX and Bell Canada, which are facing increasing competition at home, have not so far seen great returns for their investments in Britain's stagnant cable market.
France Telecom says it has held talks with Cable and Wireless about CWC becoming the British partner of its Global One alliance with Deutsche Telekom AG and America's Sprint Corp.
Analysts note that if Global One wants to link up with CWC, it is more likely to convince the North Americans to sell out rather than chase a small amount of shares in the open market next week -- which could become expensive.
CWC had pro forma revenues of 1.9 billion pounds with net income of 44 million pounds in the year to March 1996.

4954,"Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp is in talks with France's Cie Generale des Eaux about taking a stake in its French railway venture, a CGE unit said on Tuesday.
The talks could bring the world's biggest telecoms group closer to one of its keenest suitors -- British Telecommunications Plc.
CGE's subsidiary Cegetel, in which BT is investing 1.1 billion pounds ($1.8 billion) to take a 25 percent stake, confirmed the talks after a source close to CGE told Reuters in London NTT was considering a 9.9 percent stake in CGE's railway venture, Telecom Developpement, TD.
""Generale des Eaux is in talks with NTT,"" a source close to the French company told Reuters.
Cegetel, which is France's second telecoms operator and majority-owned by CGE, can take a stake of up to 49.9 percent in TD. But it might limit its holding to 40 percent and seek a minority partner to take the balance, the source said.
BT, with its U.S. partner MCI Communications Corp , has been trying to gain a foothold in the lucrative Asian markets for years as has been openly courting NTT.
Asia remains the last gap in BT and MCI's global jigsaw of deals that span the globe, offering sophisticated communications services mainly to high-margin, corporate customers.
Although BT and NTT are collaborating in a bid to secure the second national licence in Singapore, BT has so far failed to clinch a closer deal with the company in Japan.
The Japanese company, which is looking to make its first foreign investment in a key European market, has been eyeing the 117 billion franc ($20 billion) French telecom market since the summer when it started talks about joining Cegetel, the source said.
Analysts say Cegetel is well-placed to launch as assault on monopoly France Telecom when the market, which is expected to grow to 187 billion francs by 2003, is eased open to competition in 1998.
But Cegetel's partners -- CGE, BT, Germany's Mannesmann AG and SBC Communications Inc of the U.S. -- were unwilling to make place for the Japanese heavyweight by selling part of their stakes in a pivotal European market.
However in February, Cegetel was selected to run a network owned by Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer (SNCF) via the state-owned rail group's subsidiary, Telecom Developpement.
The move boosted Cegetel's position as second national operator, giving it access to 8,000 kilometres of optic fibre across the country, as well as radio links, which will be expanded to some 12,000 kilometres in the next six years.
It also opened up the possibility of a deal with NTT.
Cegetel, which already runs France's second-biggest mobile telecommunications network SFR, plans to buy at least 40 percent of the shares in TD, leaving up to 9.9 percent for the right strategic partner.
""(Cegetel) can go up to 49.9 percent in a partnership where this partner will be a minority partner,"" the source said, adding that talks with NTT have now centred on this venture.
He declined to divulge how much the stakes were worth.
Although NTT is not the only potential minority partner in talks with CGE, the source declined to name other parties.
""It is quite possible that nothing happens for a year,"" he noted.
Investment bankers expect NTT to be looking to gain a toe-hold in the top four or five European markets and say they would be surprised if efforts are being focused exclusively on France.
The company has not been short of suitors. NTT, which was in December freed by the government to pursue international business, controls virtually all of the local network in Japan as well as having a large presence in Asia.
There are three main global alliances that are eager to link up with NTT; BT and MCI's Concert, Global One; which incorporates France Telecom, Deutsche Telekom AG and America's Sprint Corp and U.S. telecoms giant AT &amp; T Corp's loosely-knit global alliance World Partners/Unisource.

4958,"London telecoms analysts are split about the prospects of Britain's Cable and Wireless Communications, the telephone and television cable company that made its market debut on Monday.
CWC started trading, as expected, at around 300 pence per share and rose to 309 pence before edging back to 299.5, valuing the group at around 4.46 billion pounds.
CWC, which was formed last year when the Mercury subsidiary of Cable and Wireless Plc merged with the three cable TV units of NYNEX Corp and Bell Canada, floated a 14.7 percent stake in London and New York.
Brokers Lehman Brothers says a 4.5 billion pound implies an enterprise value of about 6.0 billion pounds, assuming pro forma net debt at the end of 1996 at 1.5 billion stg. The valuation assumes a 700-800 million stg premium to the sum of the parts, assuming a valuation of Mercury of 2.0 billion pounds.
""The timing required to accomplish the technical integration of the various parts as well as the investments necessary to establish the new brand on a nation-wide basis suggest that at 4.5 billion stg, CWC assets are fairly valued.""
With 2.3 billion pounds of capital expenditure, CWC plans to complete its sophisticated broadband cable and local telephone networks and offer its services to six million customers by 2001.
However, other analysts, such as Richard Jones at brokers Yamaichi and Andrew Harrington at Salomon Brothers, were more bullish.
Jones is recommending buying the stock up to 350 pence per share. Harrington values the shares at 438p and the company at 6.5 billion pounds.
Harrington argues that CWC's network cost structure has a competitive advantage against its main telephony and multi-channel television provider -- British Telecommunications Plc and satellite broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc.
""It's got 50 percent fewer employees per line than BT,"" he said. ""We think CWC has a unique competitive advantage in the provision of multi-channel TV and telephony. I think it's going to exceed expectations in the next year.""
CWC's core business will be the telephony provided by Mercury. Initially, 91 percent of revenues will come from telephony and only nine percent from entertainment, but it will be the first company to be able to bundle multi-channel television and telephony.
Nevertheless, some analysts are cautious about the new company's prospects. Cable television companies have yet to make a profit in Britain's stagnant market.
""On a longer-term view, any valuation becomes almost entirely dependent on your view of what the longer-term penetration rate is going to be for telephony and cable TV,"" noted one analyst, who declined to be named.
He said BT would move into broadcasting by 2001 at the latest, when current regulatory restrictions are lifted, and the group was likely to move into interactive services such as home shopping and home banking sooner.
""Put that alongside the impact of BT's on-going marketing muscle in basic telephony, combined with the impact of digital terrestrial TV and digital satellite TV, and I think that will all serve to put a brake on our expectations of long-term cable TV penetration,"" he said.
Oliver Ehrenberg, telecoms analyst at Robert Fleming, says CWC is not worth more than 3.75 billion pounds -- and says his valuation is already stretched.
But Harrington brushed aside these concerns, noting that BT's network will need a lot of investment to upgrade its telephone lines so they can support multi-channel TV and interactive services.
""Everything BT can do Cable and Wireless Communications can to better and sooner,"" he said.

4959,"British Telecommunications Plc flexed its muscles on Thursday, saying it would not hesitate to launch a legal challenge to any government windfall tax on its profits.
Reporting a rise in annual pretax profits to 3.2 billion pounds ($5.3 billion) from 3.02 billion, chairman Sir Iain Vallance said the group owed it to its investors to attempt to fight any Labour plans to tax its earnings.
""If we are stung in a big way for this tax and if it can be challenged legally, we owe it to our shareholders to challenge it,"" Vallance told BBC radio.
But he added the company would be ""very sad"" to start a partnership with Labour, which swept to power on May 1 for the first time in 18 years, on such a footing.
""I would not have voted Labour had (a windfall tax on BT) been in the manifesto,"" Vallance told reporters.
The government says it will levy a one-off tax on what it calls the ""excess profits"" of privatised utilities, whose large executive salaries and surging dividend payments to shareholders have enraged consumer groups.
Labour, which wants to raise money to help get the young and long-term unemployed back to work, declines to identify the firms it plans to target and BT's comments found favour with another potential target -- BAA.
The British airports operator is taking legal advice and accused Labour of ""verging on irresponsibility"" by not detailing who would be hit.
Unlike water and electricity companies, which are resigned to the tax, BT's Vallance charged that it would be ""perverse"" to line up BT with utilities for punishment.
""We're not a monopoly, not a utility, heavily regulated, have very low call charges, an excellent customer service record, we're very important for the UK in getting jobs in the information society that we're in at the moment and therefore why tax us?"" he asked.
But he said BT would not pull out of its ""superhighway"" agreement with Labour, whereby it will wire up for free schools and hospitals. It is hoping for an early release from a ban on using its main network for broadcasting.
While BT was in a fighting mood, it also threw a challenge to its industry regulator Oftel. BT accuses Oftel of suggesting ""unduly harsh"" curbs on the prices BT charges rivals for carrying calls on its network.
Oftel has published a consultation paper suggesting that a basket of so-called ""interconnect"" prices should fall between 6-12 percent below the rate of inflation.
But finance director Robert Brace told reporters that even the lower end of this range was too harsh -- on top of a one-off price cut of 10-20 percent -- and would harm infrastructure investment in Britain.
""In extremis, we would be prepared to challenge it (the price regime) at the Monopolies and Mergers Commission,"" he said, adding that interconnect charges in Britain were about one third of those in other countries.
Thursday's results from BT, which left its shares barely changed at 450.5p, are likely to be its last in its current form.
Once its ambitious $20 billion merger with its American partner MCI Communications Corp is cleared by U.S. regulators, a new company called Concert Plc, will be floated in London and New York.
BT on Wednesday won approval from European regulators for what is the biggest transatlantic merger in history.
With final approval expected in autumn, Concert will be the second biggest company in terms market value on the London stock exchange.
Andrew Harrington, analyst at Salomon Brothers, says Concert appears to be the best positioned global carrier in a rapidly consolidating telecoms industry.
But he warns that 50 percent of BT's revenues and 66 percent of its profits depend on an increasingly competitive domestic business.
BT, which raised total dividends 6.l percent to 19.85p, said despite fierce price wars it was increasing its domestic market share amid a strong growth in demand for its products and services.
But price cuts in the year came to 840 million pounds -- nearly six percent of its 14.9 billion pound turnover.
BT maintained its inland call volume growth at seven percent although annual international call volume growth slipped a touch -- also to seven percent.
A strengthening pound also hit BT's international call sales. Together with a 14 percent price cut in the year, international turnover fell 8.6 percent, BT said. ($ = 0.608 British Pounds)

4960,"Shares in Cable and Wireless Plc surged on Friday on market hopes that Britain's second biggest telecoms company was poised to seal a deal with China, ending some uncertainty over the future of its biggest asset -- Hong Kong Telecom.
The stock jumped 26.5p to 524p by 1130 GMT after Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd announced that C&amp;W was in discussions with China on future cooperation.
""We understand that these discussions are continuing but there is no certainty as to how and when these will be concluded or as to their effect in relation to Hong Kong Telecom,"" the company said in a statement.
C&amp;W, which declined to comment further, has said it has been in talks with China for some time. But the statement fuelled market hopes that a deal was imminent.
With Hong Kong reverting to Chinese rule at midnight in just 24 days, analysts expect C&amp;W to be encouraged to reduce its near 59 percent stake in the main telephone service provider on the island -- in return for growth opportunities on the booming Chinese mainland.
A sharp rise in Hong Kong Telecom's (HKT) shares to a new year high of HK$19.25 also assumes significant mainland Chinese access, analysts say.
However, some experts say that although the potential for growth in China is indisputable, the ability to make attractive returns from investments in that growth remains unproven.
But with a deal widely expected, analysts are now focusing on how big a stake C&amp;W would sell, at what discount, whether the Chinese would offer an asset swap -- or if C&amp;W gets cash, how it would match the hefty returns HKT used to generate when reinvesting disposal proceeds.
""There could be a scenario whereby Hong Kong Telecom just swaps some assets with the Chinese...in return for a certain percentage in HKT which would solve the Chinese cash burden,"" said one analyst, who declined to be named. ""They have to lay a lot of lines over the next couple of years. Then it's a question of what the Chinese are going to give up? You're not going to be running the Beijing telephone company,"" he added.
China has already secured a 7.74 percent stake in Hong Kong Telecom at a 15 percent discount via a company called China Everbright Group, which is directly under the supervision of China's State Council.
""Holdings in other British-controlled Hong Kong companies have in the past been sold to the Chinese at substantial share price discounts,"" notes C&amp;W's brokers, ABN AMRO Hoare Govett.
But it adds: ""A deal in Hong Kong would reinforce the bull case for C&amp;W by removing uncertainty over prospects, while underpinning sum of the parts valuations of the company, which suggests that the shares are worth around 650p.""
Few analysts believe C&amp;W will want to lose majority control of HKT, which contributes 65-70 percent of its profits and offers a robust return on equity of 49 percent, according to Reuters Security 3000 data.
But some say the British company may have to reach a compromise with China, albeit ""kicking and screaming"".
Nevertheless, a sale could leave C&amp;W with 1.0 billion pounds ($1.6 billion) or more to invest.
Deals tipped by experts include a share buy-back or special dividend at both C&amp;W and HKT, buying the remaining 50 percent in C&amp;W's mobile venture One2One from its joint-owner, U S West Inc, or telecoms investments in the Chinese mainland. ($ = 0.615 British Pounds)

4969,"Diversified British leisure company First Leisure Corp Plc said on Tuesday first half profits slipped five percent and warned that early second half trading was not as good as expected.
The group, which operates nightclubs, fitness centres and bingo clubs, said pre-tax profits in the six months to end-April fell to 17.2 million pounds ($28.7 million) on turnover of 88.8 million pounds.
Although profits were at the top-end of expectations, a negative trading statement which noted that its ailing bingo hall division was still not improving, sent the group's shares falling 17.5 pence to 318.5p as some analysts scaled back full year profit forecasts.
An interim dividend of 2.64p per share was also below expectations of 2.7-2.75p.
""The results were a bit disappointing,"" said one leisure analyst at a leading brokerage. ""We will have to look at our estimates again.""
First Leisure, which blamed some good weather in May for keeping customers out of its indoor leisure businesses, said its bingo hall division remained its top priority and it pledged innovations to win back consumers in the next year.
Chairman Michael Grade admitted that the group had made operational mistakes in the past. But he told reporters that, with a new management team at the division, the group should be able to turn it around.
Grade joined the company in January after quitting as chief executive at Channel 4.
""I don't believe there is any evidence to suggest that the British public has given up playing Bingo,"" he said. ""Bingo is the second biggest leisure activity after angling in the country. We're not getting our share of it...we got it wrong operationally.""
First Leisure, which has a 100 million pound development programme in place, says there is plenty of growth in its dancing and sports divisions -- both in the family entertainment centres and health and fitness operation.
But the group said it had underestimated its competitors' response when it came into the bingo market. Amid little evidence of a consumer boom, Grade noted lottery scratch cards had also taken their toll on market share.
Although Grade declined to be specific, he said the group had to give the restructuring time to effect a turn-around.
""I don't want to put a time frame on it,"" he told a telephone conference call. ""All I would say is that I am not known for having unlimited patience and I'm watching the situation very carefully indeed.""
The group's bingo halls saw comparable sales in the first half fall 25 percent as fewer people were attracted, and traded at a loss of 1.3 million pounds after pre-opening costs and administration charges.
At current trading levels, the business is expected to report a flat result for the second half. First Leisure plans to complete an initial development programme of 20 new generation bingo halls in 1997/98.
Grade declined to comment on market talk that First Leisure might be taken over by a company such as leisure company Rank Group Plc.
""This is a very independent business. It thrives on being independent and I intend to keep it that way,"" he said. ""I'm here for the long term.""

4973,"British Telecommunications will start talks with European regulators within the next week about its planned $20 billion merger with America's MCI after the deal was overwhelmingly backed by investors on Tuesday.
MCI shareholders approved the ambitious deal two weeks ago, leaving regulatory clearance the last hurdle to the creation of Concert Plc -- a ""global supercarrier"" with annual revenues of more than 25 billion pounds ($40.5 billion) and 43 million customers.
A BT spokesman said the company remained confident of winning a green light from both the European Commission, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice by autumn.
But he could not confirm speculation that Brussels might demand two minor concessions which include modifications to the two groups' dominant position in audio and video conferencing and guarantees that competition can have reasonable access to Concert's transatlantic facilities.
The EC is due to report by June 11 on BT's plans to buy the 80 percent it does not already own of MCI Communications Corp, the aggressive, U.S. long-distance operator that has become the second, long-distance carrier in the U.S. behind phone giant AT &amp; T Corp.
Ahead of expected regulatory approval, a resounding 98.5 percent of BT's 2.3 million shareholders backed the merger, sweeping aside concerns raised by some analysts that a 30 percent premium which BT is paying is a high price for control.
The deal creates the world's fourth largest telecoms group in terms of sales after Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT), America's AT&amp;T and Germany's Deutsche Telekom.
""I have reservations about the merger,"" said pensioner Stella Garton-Brown, who has been a small shareholder in BT since the company was privatised in 1984. ""I'm not always sure that bigger is best.""
But powerful financial institutions, that own about 73 percent of BT, tend traditionally to back company boards.
Some analysts put down a surge in BT's share price during key transatlantic roadshows over the last weeks to proof of support for what will be the biggest transatlantic deal in history. Others put the share price down to index-linked buying.
Sir Iain Vallance, the chairman of BT and co-chairman designate of Concert, told shareholders that because of the development of new technology and the globalisation of the booming $650 billion telecoms market, the merger would bring benefits that BT could not deliver alone.
Concert combined the feistiness of the younger, fast-growing MCI with the stability of BT -- ""the world's best market defender coupled with the world's best market attacker"", he said.
BT and MCI currently hold about six percent of the global telecoms market, which is expected to top one trillion dollars by 2000. But Vallance said: ""We want to go after the other 94 percent.""
Concert wants to provide clients around the globe with local, long distance, international and mobile phone services as well as multi-media, Internet-based services and systems integration for business clients.
The group plans to be represented in key countries across the world so it can focus on winning high-margin, multinational clients that analysts estimate account for about 15-20 percent of global telecoms revenue.
A deal with MCI also opens up the world's largest telecoms market to BT -- the United States is home to 40 percent of the largest multinational company headquarters. BT also hopes to take a share of the lucrative local market through MCI as this is opened up to competition.
MCI shareholders will receive 5.4 Concert shares for each MCI share and $6.0 cash. BT shareholders get a 2.2 billion pound special dividend and total dividend for this year of 19.85p.
BT has promised that the merger, after an initial five percent earnings dilution, will yield savings from combining overlapping services of 1.5 billion pounds over the first five years and 500 million pounds pre-tax annually after that.
But merchant banks such as Robert Fleming are sceptical about company forecasts of a six percent annual dividend rise as increasing competition is set to dampen healthy call volumes and drive down prices nearer to the relatively marginal cost of delivering them.
Fleming says BT's gearing level might surge to 150 percent in the next three years and has downgraded its recommendation on BT to ""sell"" because it says the group's valuation looks stretched against other European telecom groups.
The merchant bank's gearing calculation includes a 1-1.2 billion pound windfall tax if Britain's opposition Labour Party wins the May 1 election and an approximate 1.6 billion pound acquisition of the remaining 40 percent of BT's mobile phone business Cellnet.
It also includes other investments in Europe and key Asia Pacific markets, where Concert has yet to build a large presence. ($= 0.616 British Pounds)

4975,"Urgent calls for a global regulatory framework to help combat the risk of crime in the borderless world of the Internet computer network were stepped up on Wednesday by a high-level think tank.
The Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation (CSFI) said that without effective regulation, the Internet could generate a wave of financial scandals, undermine national regulation of financial markets and leave consumers without effective protection.
But in what it called the most comprehensive study make on the potential impact of the Internet on the financial services industry, the Finance Ministry and Bank of England-backed CSFI said the Internet also offered vast opportunities to financial services.
The computer network offered an ""intensely low-cost distribution medium"" -- up to 10 times lower than others -- CSFI director Andrew Hilton told Reuters television.
The CSFI also warned against paranoia, noting that objective information about crime in cyberspace was still scarce.
The extensive use of cryptography -- encoding data, establishing its authenticity and preventing its undetected modification and unauthorised use -- also meant business in cyberspace was more secure than giving a credit card number to a store over the telephone.
The CSFI also suggested a ""kitemark"" to identify regulated firms on the Internet, a greater use of ""firewalls"" or ""sheep dips"" -- anti virus programmes for automatically blocking intruders and for seeking out those who have gained access to unauthorised data -- and tighter security procedures imposed on staff.
""The biggest vulnerability of all is negligence,"" the report said.  But without the proper infrastructure, financial services over the Internet could fizzle out.
Hilton conceded that banks, brokers and even exchanges could go out of business as new players emerged with no ""legacy"" costs sunk in bricks and mortar.
But he added: ""It could happen. But I think it would be wrong to say it will happen because many of these institutions will also be the beneficiaries of the Internet.
""They are quick, they can adapt and effectively dominate this new medium. But they do have legacy systems and these are costs they are carrying that a new entrant might not have,"" he said.
But with the prospect of a global market, the concepts of local regulation might also quickly become outmoded -- as might the notion of a service being provided from one place.
""The movement towards a global marketplace would logically point to a movement to global regulation,"" said Andrew Large, the chairman of Britain's top financial watchdog the Securities and Investment Board, in a foreword to the report.
""Whether, or how quickly, this might happen is not clear,"" he added.
Regulators could attempt the difficult task of  maintaining local jurisdictional control by imposing requirements focing firms to limit access to Web sites.
They could also recognise standards of regulation which allow authorised financial services firms to offer services in any other jurisdiction, Large suggested.
The report, the product of eight working groups of over 120 people from 70 institutions, said that traditional financial service providers, particularly banks, could play a major role in promoting consumer confidence in the Internet.
Insitutions are the service providers and are in a position to supply the payments infrastructure for electronic commerce and underpin its credibility.
""For financial service companies, the Internet poses a threat, but also a major new business opportunity,"" the CSFI said.

4977,"One 2 One, the British mobile telephone company jointly-owned by Cable and Wireless Plc and U S West Inc, said on Thursday that it was not in talks about joining Cable and Wireless Communications.
Analysts have speculated that the digital cellular company may join CWC, Britain's biggest telephone and television cable company formed by the merger of C&amp;W's Mercury 'phone unit with the three British cable divisions of NYNEX Corp, Bell Cablemedia Plc.
Such a deal would involve U S West selling its 50 percent stake in One 2 One, because the U.S. company is also a major shareholder in CWC's main cable rival -- Telewest Communications Plc.
But One 2 One's managing director Jan Peters told reporters at a business briefing: ""There are no plans to do that and no negotiations to do that.""
Peters said both investors were ""very committed"" to One 2 One, adding that the cellular company could reap synergies from striking distribution, marketing and packaging deals with both CWC and Telewest, which would not involve any structural changes to the companies.
Other future joint deals might also involve CWC or Telewest buying airtime from One 2 One and using it for their own packages and brands.
""We're working with both of them, looking at the options,"" Peters said.
One 2 One -- which has shown marked recovery from a lack of network coverage and what critics described as poor marketing -- was unveiling four, new customer packages designed to expand its business by broadening its appeal.
Available from June 3, the new ""time plan"" deals -- called One 2 Weekend, One 2 30, One 2 100 and One 2 200 -- offer either up to 200 minutes of free voice, fax or data calls nationally or unlimited free weekend local calls.
Monthly service charges from 17.50 stg for One 2 Weekend to 40 stg for One 2 200 compare favourably with similar packages offered by rivals Cellnet Orange Plc and Vodafone Group Plc.
But Peters said the new launches were not part of a new price war in an increasingly competitive market, but rather a move to improve packaging to reduce customer confusion amid a myriad of different package offerings.
One 2 One, one of Britain's newest cellular operators that was launched in September 1993, has won 620,000 customers and captured around 8.8 percent of the national mobile market.
The company, which has doubled year-on-year growth and revenues, said key annualised revenues per subscriber were tracking rivals at around 420 stg compared to Orange's 442 stg, Cellnet's 474 stg and Vodafone's 542.
Total capital expenditure of 970 million stg is planned to March 1998 and national coverage should be boosted from a current 85 percent to 95 percent of the population by the end of this year.
One 2 One's losses widenden to 276 million stg last year as it rolled out its network. But the company said it was on track to break-even on the operating cash level in 1998.

4983,"Privatisation, the flagship economic policy of Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives, was good to British Telecommunications.
From its menial beginnings as a Post Office appendage, the company has grown meteorically into a formidable, telecoms giant whose network of alliances span most of the globe.
The sale of BT in 1984 began what was dubbed ""the long march of privatisation"" under 18 years of Conservative rule which has been emulated by governments around the world.
The Conservative legacy has transformed British industry and even helped inspire the former communists of eastern Europe.
But this march could come to a shuddering halt following the Labour Party's landslide victory in Britain's May 1 election.
It is not that New Labour, created from the roots of a party that traditionally favoured state ownership, necessarily wants to protect nationalised firms from being pressed by shareholders into delivering efficiencies. It doesn't.
It's just that there is little left to privatise. As one commentator pointed out: ""Most of the family silver is long gone, what remains is little more than the teaspoons.""
Led by former Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher, the government triggered a controversial and comprehensive privatisation programme which raised more than 68 billion pounds ($110.4 billion) for the Treasury's coffers.
Industries from aerospace, airlines, buses, railways, coal, electricity, gas, steel, telecommunications and water went under the hammer.
The former Conservative chancellor (finance minister) Kenneth Clarke says privatised companies now contribute 2.6 billion pounds a year in taxes compared with 37 million when they were in state hands.
""Whether you support privatisation is a litmus test of whether you seriously support free enterprise,"" Clarke said.
BT, MODEL PRIVATISED TELECOMS COMPANY
BT, whose 14.2 billion pound sale 13 years ago was one of the biggest the world had seen, has created a model privatised telecoms company.
In 1984, BT was a true monopoly. It operated its network, supplied the services and telephone equipment and employed 245,000 staff. Quality of service was mixed, waiting times for new lines long and mobile telephony barely existed.
From such an unprepossessing start, a much leaner BT last year launched the biggest transatlantic merger in history, proposing to buy America's second long distance carrier MCI Communications Corp for $20 billion.
Together, BT and MCI will form Concert Plc, a powerful alliance whose empire connects 41 countries.
BT, currently valued at around 28 billion pounds, still dominates the British telecoms market. But it faces increasing competition from 150 rivals in the domestic market and 46 international carriers.
However, some observers say its success owes more to the strategic cunning of its executives and break-neck speed of new technology rather than Conservative party policy.
Others blame an over-hasty privatisation to raise cash for tax cuts for driving the company to seek its global fortune with an American carrier rather than with its British rival, Cable and Wireless Plc.
BT's planned 33 billion pound merger with C&amp;W, which would have brought with it vital access to the lucrative Asian telecoms markets, was abandoned last May -- partly because of concerns that regulators might block the deal.
George Pitcher, chief executive of management consultancy Luther Pendragon, believes corporate liberation in Britain has been simultaneously stifled by heavy-handed and ill-considered regulation.
""BT and Cable and Wireless would have been a huge force and a great opportunity for Britain,"" Pitcher says.
British Gas, which was privatised as a monopoly, has been regulated into break-up and may well be taken over. Eleven of 12 electricity suppliers have snapped up -- seven by U.S. groups keen on their cash-spinning powers.
TV AMBITION'S THWARTED
An unrelenting regulatory rein has also prevented BT from realising another of its ambitions -- turning into a television broadcaster.
The Conservative government banned BT from taking on the mainly American cable TV firms at their own game because it feared they might not survive such a market onslaught.
Consequently, consumers have had to wait years for cable groups to offer TV services which BT, with its established network, could have provided much sooner.
Ironically Labour, which has accused the government of short-changing consumers in its rush to sell state assets, promised to promptly lift the ban if it came to power.
Nevertheless, the early liberalisation of the telecoms industry has created one of the most competitive markets in the world -- and BT is exploiting its lead.
While British regulators might have frowned at a merger between BT and C&amp;W, it was the apparent openness of the British market that paved the way for BT's proposed merger with MCI.
U.S. regulatory clearance for the deal hinges on whether Britain is deemed to be as open to U.S. carriers as America is to British ones. Approval is widely expected by autumn.
With other European telecoms markets only due to be liberalised from next year, no other European carrier was in a position to launch such a deal. ($ = 0.616 British Pounds)

4988,"U.S. Midwestern local telephone company Ameritech Corp. said Friday it was in merger or acquisition talks with several European security monitoring firms worth $200 million to $500 million each.
""There are some serious negotiations going on,"" Ameritech's international affairs director Dennis LaComb told Reuters.
Chicago-based Ameritech hopes to double its current $4.0 billion in European investments over the next few years, said LaComb, who said he was in London until Saturday on a ""courtesy visit.""
""The majority of our investment internationally is in Europe. This is a very important area for us,"" he said.
Over the past six years, the Midwestern ""Baby Bell"" has taken stakes in privatisations abroad in countries such as Hungary and New Zealand.
LaComb said that security monitoring -- using telephone lines to link customers' home alarm systems to police stations -- was a natural business direction for the $31.3 billion telecommuications company to take.
Ameritech, which is facing its first taste of competition in its local market, is the second-biggest U.S. security monitoring company and hopes to become the European market leader.
The first deals are likely to be struck in Germany and France, although the company said it was also looking at firms in Scandinavia and was considering Britain.
Unlike some of its sister Baby Bells, Ameritech has no current designs on becoming a global telecommunications player.
Instead, it wants to focus its international strategy on regional telecommunications, communications such as alarm systems and exporting its knowledge of customer services and of operating in competitive markets to telecommunications firms, such as Portugal Telecom SA, which are on the verge of privatisation.
Ameritech's foreign ventures so far include stakes in Telecom Corporation of New Zealand, a local, long distance and cellular phone and satellite television service provider, Poland's Polska Telefonia Komorkowa and Norway's NetCom GSM, two cellular telephone operators.
It has partnered with Germany's Deutsche Telekom AG to take a stake in Hungary's incumbent Matav Rt telecommunications operator and also holds a stake in Belgacom, the Belgium national operator.
International investments also include a joint venture in China's regional cellular operator ChinaCom.
